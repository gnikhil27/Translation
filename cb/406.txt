Night.
<br><br>Yi Feng committed sleepy, dozing off on the shell of slowly.
<br><br>Before sleeping, Yi Feng turned the direction called slowly towards the North Sea.
<br><br>Because he thought carefully, although the Central Continent is the cradle of the strong, here the opportunities are relatively more, but the threshold must be correspondingly much higher.
<br><br>The North Sea, on the other hand, is very different, the temperature here is quite a bit lower than other places, relatively poor, so it is more suitable for people like Yi Feng to go over.
<br><br>This night.
<br><br>Something unusual happened in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>Ordinary people only know that the dark clouds shrouded the bright moon and blocked the starry sky, making the whole night sky invisible.
<br><br>But among the masters set off a big wave of Xuan Yuan.
<br><br>They clearly know that this is not any dark clouds at all, but a huge thing flying through the sky.
<br><br>Of course, it is more accurate to say not fly by. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And like creeping ......
<br><br>As for what exactly it was, they had no way of knowing, only that all the people who were lurking when that thing passed, all of them hid their breath.
<br><br>Wind.
<br><br>Whistling and passing.
<br><br>Yi Feng shivered and was directly frozen awake.
<br><br>When he opened his eyes, he found that he was actually in an unfamiliar place.
<br><br>In front of him, was the vast and endless continent.
<br><br>And behind, there were layers and layers of waves of the ocean.
<br><br>"Only one night instantly, what kind of place is this to, it seems to have even drifted across the ocean, even the temperature is so much lower, it's really strange."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked around and couldn't help but murmur.
<br><br>Coincidentally, there was a fisherman passing by the seashore, and when Yi Feng inquired a little, his mouth opened wide and surprise came wildly.
<br><br>North Sea!
<br><br>One had actually arrived at the North Sea continent!
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>"These people spread the North Sea how far and how far, spread how evil, I really thought how far, not just a few hundred kilometers away!"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but laugh.
<br><br>After all, according to his sleep time and slow speed to calculate, but is not only a few hundred kilometers away from it.
<br><br>But although the distance is only a few hundred kilometers, but coupled with the seaside climate, the weather here is still quite cold compared to Dongsheng.
<br><br>The good thing is that Yi Feng is not unprepared, directly hold the flame beads in his hands to warm himself.
<br><br>"First find a city, and then inquire about some of the powers of the North Sea!"
<br><br>Yi Feng will slowly received among the ring of space, holding the flame beads in his hand to walk in the cold wind, towards the inland.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>Seven figures appeared.
<br><br>Seven people in black robes, all emitting an icy cold aura.
<br><br>And the man at the head, he had eyes like eagle eyes, his face was expressionless, and his angular face had a hideous knife scar.
<br><br>At this point, he glanced at the afterimage.
<br><br>Looking at the ground on the avenue, a single figure walking, his eyes could not help but jump.
<br><br>This mole-sized figure is not worth mentioning to him, flat past moments he would not even look at.
<br><br>Perhaps because of the boredom of rushing, he took a look at this.
<br><br>The earthly world.
<br><br>There are no coincidences.
<br><br>It was this glance, but he found something incredible.
<br><br>With eagle-like pupils, he stared deadly at the flame bead that was emitting a faint glow in Yi Feng's hand.
<br><br>"Flame bead."
<br><br>"It's actually really a flame bead."
<br><br>"Haha, the Flame Pearl that I searched all over the North Sea, even the Central Continent and the Western Demon Forest, but I found it here."
<br><br>"It's really a great effort to find it after stepping through iron shoes!"
<br><br>He was overwhelmed with excitement and emitted a rampant laughter.
<br><br>The remaining six people looked and their eyes also lit up, revealing their excitement.
<br><br>The seven people looked at Yi Feng's position and stepped over collectively with thick and heavy steps.
<br><br>One step, is a thousand feet.
<br><br>A few steps later, seven people had arrived in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was walking with his head down, suddenly raised his head and looked at the seven people who suddenly appeared in front of him to block the road, and he couldn't help but frown.
<br><br>"Did you run into mountain thieves again?"
<br><br>"Really professional ah, before a did not see, this all of a sudden appeared."
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but spit in his heart like this.
<br><br>"Kid, hand over the beads in your hand."
<br><br>The man at the head of the group emitted a hoarse voice with majesty, making it impossible to refuse.
<br><br>"Flame beads?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>This group of dogs, they were really cheap, actually asking for his Flame Pearl.
<br><br>Although this thing was not a treasure, but in this temperature, it was his mobile furnace!
<br><br>"Not giving."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his head and directly cut off his voice.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's answer made the eagle-eyed man surprised.
<br><br>A mortal.
<br><br>Surprisingly so hard-headed, is he unable to distinguish the form?
<br><br>The seven men raised their feet.
<br><br>Then they closed in on Yi Feng.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>There are two more streams of light swept across the sky.
<br><br>A large figure and a small one.
<br><br>The first dressed beautifully, excellent temperament, coupled with her beautiful face, you can see that should also be quite a person of status.
<br><br>The small one is spirited and resourceful, but dressed plainly, should be the head woman's maid.
<br><br>Only, the two who rushed seemed to be very hasty.
<br><br>Above the pretty face, but also with a strong sadness.
<br><br>Just as the two were rushing, they happened to see this scene below.
<br><br>"That youth seems to be in a bad way."
<br><br>The young girl frowned and couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Yes, those seven black-robed people are not good people at first glance." The maid said the same.
<br><br>"Come on, let's go help him." The young girl said.
<br><br>"Miss, we'd better not meddle, we can't even protect ourselves." The maid advised.
<br><br>"Because we can't protect ourselves, we are more eager to hope for life, so we can't just stand by like this." The young girl made up her mind and directly turned around in the direction of where Yi Feng was heading.
<br><br>And the helpless maid could only quickly follow.
<br><br>"Kid, give you one more chance to hand over the beads in your hand." The man in the lead once again emitted a hoarse voice, and that unquestionable attitude seemed to be an ultimatum to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Told you no way."
<br><br>Yi Feng said forcefully.
<br><br>The head man's eyes were raised.
<br><br>A mortal who could be crushed to death with his hands was actually so unenlightened, it was already completely angered him.
<br><br>"Then you will die."
<br><br>He raised his palm and was about to make a move against Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Stop it, you guys."
<br><br>Just at this moment, a scolding female voice came from behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>It was the master and servant who had rushed in.
<br><br>They came directly to the side of Yi Feng, looked at the clean and dry Yi Feng, and after learning that Yi Feng was a mortal without cultivation, the young girl said softly, "You don't have to be afraid, we will help you."
<br><br>After saying that, the young girl stepped forward and raised her chin towards the black-robed man and shouted, "Who the hell are you people and why are you robbing him?"
<br><br>The black-robed man took a glance at this master and a servant, disdain flowed in his eyes, not even the idea of talking back, his eyes faintly flashed, a powerful aura shocked out of his body.
<br><br>This qi impact came, the young girl stifled a grunt, fierce back leg step, the face immediately became pale.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor."
<br><br>"It's actually a Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>Her mouth murmured incredulously, and her pretty face was ashen with death.
<br><br>She only wanted to help when she saw injustice, but never thought that the one who intercepted Yi Feng, a mortal, was actually a Martial Emperor!
<br><br>What is even more serious is that, when the qi was revealed just now, she clearly felt the black-clothed man's killing machine against her.
<br><br>The sky is going to kill people ah!
<br><br>The young lady couldn't help but sigh.
<br><br>But it's okay, even without today's incident, she will not live long, it's just a matter of dying early or late.
<br><br>She gave a slightly apologetic glance at Yi Feng next to her and said with loss, "Sorry, the situation appeared as we expected, we can't help you either, and I'm afraid even the two of us won't be able to get away."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng was quite speechless.
<br><br>These two girls are also funny, at first came out probably want to draw a knife to help, the results of that man fierce glare, and goose.
<br><br>Really do not know what to say.
<br><br>Of course, the spirit of these two girls still impressed him, this kind of good people are not many ah.
<br><br>So he walked out unhurriedly, softly comforted: "The girl does not have to be so discouraged, the situation which is not so far from serious as you say."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng also threw her a reassuring smile.
