The wretched exterminator and the king of the cloud top almost did not go off the deep end.
<br><br>It took a full two days to get over a breath.
<br><br>To add to their woes, Wu Tian led the Wu Tian Empire, which had already knocked down most of their Genting Empire's territory.
<br><br>Originally, it was not so bad, the Genting Empire had many experts, so it was not so bad that they could not resist a Wu Tian.
<br><br>But due to the help of the two of them, let Wu Tian rebirth nirvana several times, now Wu Tian's strength, is except for the two of them, few people can resist.
<br><br>And the integrity of the Genting Empire was naturally about qi.
<br><br>So, as Wu Tian occupied more and more territories, the qi luck within that qi luck immortal pillar was lowering a little bit every day, a little bit every day.
<br><br>The qi luck that was already left with only a drop after the yellow sky was now at the bottom.
<br><br>"What to do?"
<br><br>The exterminator ruthlessly smashed the thing next to him and roared and drank.
<br><br>Now he really does not want to open his eyes. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Every time he saw the pitiful amount of qi, his heart and liver ached.
<br><br>"At this moment, Wu Tian is no longer able to let him go, and we are unable to deal with him now, with this state of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, we are also even more unable to directly ask the messenger to take action."
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch narrowed his eyes and said gloomily, "Therefore, there must be someone to hold Wu Tian back now, so that we have enough time to recover the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar."
<br><br>"Then you should go find this person faster!"
<br><br>Perdition roared.
<br><br>"I've already contacted this person, he is now in seclusion under my empire's underground palace, only he needs seven more days to come out!" The Genting kingdom ruler said.
<br><br>"Seven days?"
<br><br>Perishable's face changed and he drank in a deep voice: "With Wu Tian's current momentum, by the time seven days have passed, he will have already hit your imperial city!"
<br><br>"Don't worry, I have another method, my Cloud Top Empire has countless sects within it, and countless pride of heaven." The Genting king said in a cold voice, "I'll give an order to them to go and hold Wu Tian back earlier."
<br><br>"Perhaps they are not Wu Tian's opponent, but I think it will be no problem to hold them back for seven days, right?"
<br><br>Destruction narrowed his eyes, his anxious appearance was then soothed a bit.
<br><br>"First use these clans to hold Wu Tian back for seven days, when the one in seclusion comes out, he alone will be able to completely lead my Cloud Top army to resist Wu Tian, and even help us recover some lost territories."
<br><br>"We, on the other hand, can just focus on our qi, and when our qi recovers a little, we can ask the messenger to step in and completely exterminate Wu Tian for us!"
<br><br>"After destroying Wu Tian, the qi luck lost because of him will all come back."
<br><br>"In this way, we will also have completely turned over!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch said solemnly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Destruction nodded and said in a hurry, "In that case, then let's arrange it as soon as possible!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch nodded and was just about to give the order when a person outside just happened to rush in.
<br><br>"Lord Kunitou ......"
<br><br>The man delivered his voice.
<br><br>But just as he opened his mouth, he was interrupted by the Genting Kingdom Sovereign and shouted, "You are just in time, listen to my order and convey it down, have the Mist Sect, Yan Sect, Wind and Fire Sect, and Tian Yi within my Genting Empire immediately bring their disciples out to stop Wu Tian's attack."
<br><br>At these words, the subordinate's face changed and he stammered, "Your Majesty, I'm afraid, I'm afraid I can't!"
<br><br>"Why not?"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch's eyes glared.
<br><br>"The Yan Clan was destroyed by the Mist Clan, and the Wind and Fire Clan was also annexed by the Heavenly Clan."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler was slightly surprised, and was also surprised that there had actually been such a change.
<br><br>But his empire has never cared about these subordinate sects, so if they are destroyed, they are destroyed, there are still the Mist Sect and the Heavenly Clan.
<br><br>So he hurriedly said: "Then ask the Mist Sect and the Heavenly One to bring their disciples."
<br><br>"Your Majesty, I haven't finished my speech yet."
<br><br>The subordinate said with an ugly face, "After the Mist Sect and the Heavenly One destroyed the two clans, they have already, already ......"
<br><br>"Already what?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler questioned with a sullen face.
<br><br>"Already, already defected to the Wu Tian Empire!"
<br><br>Looking at the narrow-eyed appearance of the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch, that subordinate prostrated himself on the ground and finally shouted out.
<br><br>PS: Something happened today, my mind was exploding, I couldn't hold a word in, sorry, only a short, feeble chapter today.
