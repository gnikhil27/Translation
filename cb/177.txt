When he bit down the half pack of spicy strips, his eyes snapped open when he was careless just now.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>Straight feel a steaming flame appearing in the body burning, seems to be to hold him up to explode seemingly, is about to erupt.
<br><br>"This this this this, so powerful energy, I can't help it ......"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Finally, the Heaven Devouring Emperor Ao Zhong accompanied by a roar, his hair shrugged out violently, while his whole face had become red.
<br><br>"Wolf Emperor, what are you, what is wrong with you?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Ao Yun shouted with a face full of anxiety.
<br><br>"Hoo, hoo!"
<br><br>Ao Zhong's mouth panted heavily, and his scarlet eyes scanned the surroundings while his mouth shouted, "Madam, Madam, where is Madam?"
<br><br>"Reporting to the wolf emperor, the madam is in the bedchamber at the back of the palace." Remember in a second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Ao Yun said in a hurry.
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, Ao Zhong broke through the roof and with a huge energy, he flew towards the back of the bedchamber.
<br><br>In the bedchamber.
<br><br>The madam was about to go to bed when she found the door smashed through with a loud bang and the Heaven Devouring Emperor rushed in with his hair shrugging.
<br><br>"Husband, what's wrong with you?"
<br><br>The madam looked at the Devouring Emperor in surprise, and an incredible voice came out.
<br><br>"Madam don't say anything, don't ask too many questions, just lie down!"
<br><br>Saying that, the aura on the Devouring Emperor's body swelled to the extreme, and with a tearing sound, the clothes on his body burst into pieces, and then his scarlet eyes pounced towards his madam.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>Throughout most of the night, the entire Heaven Devouring Palace became unsettled, and the lady's bedchamber was accompanied by the heavenly aura of the Heaven Devouring Emperor in addition to the sound of a wall collapsing from time to time.
<br><br>After a long, long time.
<br><br>The Qi flames from the Heaven Devouring Emperor only subsided, and his surrounding, is already turned into a ruin.
<br><br>"What a powerful thing Bei, it actually has such a powerful effect!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor recalled the huge energy in his body and murmured out incredulously before realizing that Ao Yun had not lied to him, his son, Ao Qing, had really brought back to him the supreme treasure that turned around the kingdom of heaven.
<br><br>Not only did he unknowingly break through to the half-exalted realm, but even at the time when that energy was at its peak, his battle power soared to Demon Exalted during that time.
<br><br>The shock in his heart made him unable to slow down for a long time.
<br><br>When he slowed down, he suddenly found his lady tripping in the ruins in front of him, dying.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Madam!"
<br><br>"Madam, how are you?"
<br><br>"Someone, quick, hurry up and save madam."
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor anxiously voiced out and hurriedly started shouting for people.
<br><br>Seeing this, countless experts from the Heaven Devouring Palace rushed to the scene, and when they saw this scene, they all became dumbfounded.
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Wolf Emperor.
<br><br>Terrible as this.
<br><br>And only after rushing to save and cure, and learning that his lady was safe and sound, the Heaven Devouring Emperor regrouped himself and returned to the main hall.
<br><br>"Ao Yun, where is Ao Yun!"
<br><br>He shouted.
<br><br>"My little one is in."
<br><br>Ao Yun hurriedly rushed over, while offering his hands to the half pack of spicy strips that the Heaven Devouring Emperor had dropped earlier.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>After receiving the half pack of spicy strips, Heaven Devouring Emperor laughed out loud and patted Ao Yun's shoulder in appreciation, "Not bad, Ao Yun you have great merit!"
<br><br>"Emperor Wolf, what merit do I have, this is all due to the Third Prince." Ao Yun said in a hurry.
<br><br>When he said that, Ao Zhong remembered his third son and grabbed Ao Yun and asked, "You said before that Qing's son had been helped by a high person and had already broken through the demon dwelling, but is it true?"
<br><br>"It's true." Ao Yun said.
<br><br>On hearing this, Ao Zhong was both shocked and surprised.
<br><br>The surprise was that his waste son had actually gone ahead of him and become a demon.
<br><br>And the shock was that high person behind him.
<br><br>How powerful an existence must be to make his wasteful son break through the Demon Dignity? And how strong must be the means to produce such supreme food!
<br><br>Looking at the spicy strip in his hand, he could not calm down for a long time.
<br><br>Then he carefully put it away and put it in the secret compartment of his close robe, hiding it like a treasure.
<br><br>Suddenly, he remembered something and hurriedly ran towards the main prison.
<br><br>In the big prison, Ao Jin was still imprisoned, his hands and feet were shackled, and on that bare head, there was still a shoe print left behind.
<br><br>"Bastard, who told you to imprison Elder Jin here?" As soon as the Heaven Devouring Emperor walked in, he started cursing, "Why don't you guys hurry up and bring the key?"
<br><br>His subordinates warily handed the key to the Heaven Devouring Emperor, their expressions filled with speechlessness.
<br><br>But aren't you the one who told us to imprison?
<br><br>Of course, they did not dare to say this directly.
<br><br>After receiving the key, Ao Zhong walked to Ao Jin's side with a smile on his face, first helped him to unlock the shackles, and patted the shoe print on his bald head, while smiling and saying, "Uh, that Jin Lao, I was rash before, don't be too hard on me, things are ah, just like you said, Qing'er is really the savior you said, your calculation is really accurate! "
<br><br>At that, Jin Lao suddenly chopped up and asked with a trembling body, "Really?"
<br><br>"Really, a thousand times true, so this emperor is sorry!" The Heaven Devouring Emperor hastily said in apology.
<br><br>"It's good that my imperial lineage is saved, it's good that it's saved!"
<br><br>With an excited shout, and after glancing at the Heaven Devouring Emperor with hatred, Ao Jin sat back down again.
<br><br>Subsequently, the head pulled shrugged down.
<br><br>"Elder Jin, Elder Jin?"
<br><br>Heaven Devouring Emperor hurriedly shouted, his palm resting on Ao Jin's arm while a surge of demonic power surged towards his body.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>As soon as he noticed the condition inside Ao Jin's body, Heaven Devouring Emperor smacked himself with a black face!
<br><br>This old man, who was obviously killed alive by him, only kept hanging on to his breath because of the resentment in his heart.
<br><br>He waved his hand and told his subordinates to bury the old man's body, before the Devouring Emperor left with a black face.
<br><br>But in his heart, but it is very difficult.
<br><br>The most important thing is that he has been killed alive, and if he had stayed with him, he would have been able to do many things for him.
<br><br>When he walked out of the prison, he realized that it was already dawn.
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>"Reporting to the Wolf Emperor, the Red Sun lineage is fighting over."
<br><br>Just then, the subordinate hurriedly came and reported loudly.
<br><br>"Good for you Red Sun One Lineage, I didn't expect you to come to my door at this time, do you really think that I, Ao Zhong, am still the Ao Zhong of yesterday?"
<br><br>"Pass my order, meet the battle!"
<br><br>With a loud shout, Ao Zhong stepped on the void and directly swept away.
