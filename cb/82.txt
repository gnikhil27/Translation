But at that moment, Yi Feng suddenly rolled over and cursed in his mouth.
<br><br>"Where did the broken flies come from, disturbing the old man's sleep."
<br><br>At the same time, with a face full of impatience, he directly waved out a slap.
<br><br>Then, under Li Mo Xie's dumbfounded eyes, the death Gu that was about to enter Yi Feng's body was directly slapped away and then heavily smashed on a side wall.
<br><br>"Pop!"
<br><br>With a light sound, it stuck to the wall in pieces, leaving only that carapace at the back to fall to the ground.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>At the moment when the  death Gu was slapped to death, Li Mo Xie's eyes almost burst out, his face was filled with a look of horror.
<br><br>At the same time, his body suffered a backlash and a mouthful of fresh blood spurted out.
<br><br>But he could not care less about the body that suffered a backlash, and could not even take another look at his  death Gu that had been raised for thousands of years, and ran away with his feet chopped into the void.
<br><br>It's too scary ......
<br><br>It's too evil ......
<br><br>Now he just wants to escape this place, it is best to run as far away as possible.
<br><br>It is clear that the Heavenly Yin Formation is in effect ah, it is clear that his cultivation is restricted ah, why would it still be like this, he really can't figure it out!
<br><br>And his  death Gu can not only kill in the invisible ah, its shell is also known for its unbelievable, whether suffering from fire or flooding, or the full force of the Martial Emperor's slap, but not necessarily be able to break the  death Gu's shell.
<br><br>However, that person casually wacked and his death Gu's bones were completly broken and its body was shattered?
<br><br>The moment he thought of his  death Gu's miserable state, it was like he saw himself.
<br><br>So this moment, he no longer dare to have thoughts about martial arts hall or deprive Yi Feng's qi.
<br><br>He ran away at speed which he has never thought was possible, afraid that me might be chased.
<br><br>In less than half a quarter of an hour, Li Mo Xie turned into a stream of light in mid-air and fled the area where Pingjiang City was located, arriving in the airspace not far from the <abbr title="Castle Peak Gate">Qingshan Sect</abbr>.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Fortunately."
<br><br>Seeing that there were no pursuers behind him, Li Mo Xie then breathed a sigh of relief with a head full of sweat.
<br><br>However, just as he took a breath, the next moment, he was scared all over.
<br><br>Not far in front of him, I do not know when a black-robed man appeared, a wide robe covering his whole body, while lowering his head, can not see his appearance clearly.
<br><br>But the appearance of this person brought a great sense of crisis to Li Mo Xie.
<br><br>He was like a person with no cultivation, and his whole body had no aura, just standing in mid-air, motionless.
<br><br>What's even more incredible is that when Li Mo Xie closed his eyes to sense the surroundings, he couldn't sense this person's presence at all.
<br><br>"What are you?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie asked in a panic.
<br><br>Under the black robe, there was no sound.
<br><br>Li Mo Xie's eyes were raised, and as soon as his feet chopped the void into an arc, he swept away in a different direction towards the black-robed man.
<br><br>Obviously, he did not want to entangle with the black-robed man who came out of nowhere, after all, this black-robed man's weirdness, invisiblity brought him a huge sense of oppression.
<br><br>However, he just as he stopeed, found that the black-robed man appeared in front of him again.
<br><br>Still the same quietly stepped in the void standing, still no breath.
<br><br>But Li Mo Xie's face changed greatly.
<br><br>Because he couldn't even see how the black-robed man had shifted in front of him, as if he was already in that place ......
<br><br>"What the hell are you?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie cold sweat, but still gritted his teeth and asked.
<br><br>The black-robed man, still standing quietly, did not fluctuate a bit.
<br><br>"Humph, pretending to be a god, since you don't say, then I can't be blamed." Li Mo Xie coldly snorted, knowing that this black-robed man was not going to let him leave, so he might as well make the first move.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, the aura of a martial Ancestor spread out in mid-air, and with a flip of his palm, he transformed his hand into a palm, and blasted towards the black-robed man in an overwhelming manner.
<br><br>"Boom boom boom boom ......"
<br><br>A series of shock waves came towards the black-robed man, like layers of waves, layer upon layer, under this vast attack, the entire sky turned into a vacuum, and even became directly distorted.
<br><br>"An expert is fighting?"
<br><br>And while Li Mo Xie was executing the attack, at the <abbr title="Castle Peak Gate">Qingshan Sect</abbr> not far away, Lu Dasheng, who was in seclusion, snapped open his eyes, then turned into a stream of light and swept up into mid-air, rushing in the direction of the battle fluctuations.
