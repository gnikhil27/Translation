This pickup.
<br><br>Another seven days.
<br><br>"Let's go guys, Heaven and Earth Gate's trash is poured out today, it will be too late if we don't go again!"
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan looked at his storage ring full of treasures, a face of satisfaction.
<br><br>Nowadays, he has made a good living in the island.
<br><br>Cultivation has increased, but also completely changed a state of mind.
<br><br>Every day without stress, occasionally drink with his friends, or play chess with the rest of the island.
<br><br>Life is simply full of comfort, beautiful!
<br><br>And so the days went on.
<br><br>Another month.
<br><br>Today, he is completely integrated into the island, also long ago as the original people, the island's heaven and earth door has also become his faith. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>He saw another mutilated painting.
<br><br>The power of the great dao on the painting gave him some enlightenment, so he hurriedly opened the storage ring, the broken painting carefully put in, also want to find a place to close the enlightenment.
<br><br>But just open the storage ring, but found hidden in the storage ring has not looked at the transmission jade slip, has been flashing light.
<br><br>Look at its fluctuations, there should be more than ten transmission he has not come to receive.
<br><br>And this one jade slip is the specific transmission jade slip between him and the extinction.
<br><br>"Oh no, Lord Exterminator is still waiting for my letter!"
<br><br>After slowing down, Teng Xiyuan fiercely exclaimed.
<br><br>A look of remorse immediately appeared on his face.
<br><br>"I actually almost duo fall, I'm really not a fucking thing!"
<br><br>Said, even more fiercely slapped himself.
<br><br>"Pick up the garbage properly, what am I distracted from, actually still duo fall to think back to the extinction of that little thing."
<br><br>"Continue to pick up."
<br><br>A firm drink, continue to turn over the trash to find the opportunity, but also the flickering light of the jade slips crushed with a foot.
<br><br>But when the jade slip was crushed, the exterminator opened his eyes violently.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>"Could it be that this guy has been discovered?"
<br><br>The Exterminator tightened his pupils.
<br><br>He should know that Teng Xiyuan was his trump card pawn to find out the clues.
<br><br>And Teng Xiyuan was late in receiving his transmission, not to mention that now the jade slip was even destroyed.
<br><br>Then it means that Teng Xiyuan is likely to be captured, or even killed by someone.
<br><br>The face of the exterminator is a little gloomy.
<br><br>So easy to play such a card, he did not want to waste.
<br><br>In order to find out the cause, he once again used the power of the astral image.
<br><br>"Teng Xiyuan."
<br><br>"Check!"
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>The power of the astral image rose in all directions.
<br><br>Under this investigation, it was at least possible to find out Teng Xiyuan's current state of existence.
<br><br>Whether he was dead or alive, sealed or controlled, there would always be a feedback.
<br><br>However, looking at the still rotating astrological power, the heart of the exterminator already has a little answer.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan, in all probability, is more or less unlucky.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>The result came out.
<br><br>But the results before the eyes, let the world fell.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan not only alive and well, it seems to be living a prosperous life, even the realm has been raised several times.
<br><br>The most damned infuriating thing was that the power of the astral image also revealed to him that the jade slip was crushed by Teng Xiyuan.
<br><br>"Damn it damn it!"
<br><br>A furious voice came from Exterminating World.
<br><br>The powerful anger criss-crossed, causing a sonic boom sound to come from the entire space around him.
<br><br>He never thought that he had actually been tricked by Teng Xiyuan.
<br><br>It was ridiculous to still place all his hopes on him, waiting with bated breath for his message.
<br><br>"It seems that this tentacle hidden in the shadows is really something that one should not underestimate!"
<br><br>"Even Teng Xiyuan has given me a counter-movement, what a good tactic!"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He quickly calmed down.
<br><br>Because more than Teng Xiyuan, what made him feel gloomy was that things had developed to the point where the whole situation was no longer under control.
<br><br>Not a single thing was developing according to his intention.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>This is not his intention, but through the power of the astrological signs, by the one behind the faintly revealed to him ah.
<br><br>If his calculations went wrong, it would be fine.
<br><br>But how could there be a problem with the calculations of the one behind him?
<br><br>"I'm afraid, I need to re-communicate with the Lord."
<br><br>"I just don't know what important information the lord will tell me this time."
<br><br>Once again, Perdition communicated the power of the astral image.
<br><br>And this time, unlike before, he knelt down directly on the ground, head looking at the sky, and prostrated himself.
<br><br>The mouth was vibrating with words.
<br><br>And his face was also paling to a degree visible to the naked eye.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>The sky star image suddenly changed.
<br><br>Only to see the astral image condensed, slowly condensed in the sky above the head of the extinction can change the number.
<br><br>"Is this the number of heaven's determination?"
<br><br>"The lord is re-telling me the number of the heaven-determined people."
<br><br>"But even if one dies, or even if they are no longer under my control, shouldn't the number still be two hundred and thirty-three?"
<br><br>"There's no need to reveal this kind of information repeatedly, is there?"
<br><br>The exterminator looked up at the astrological image in the sky and murmured out.
<br><br>As time passed.
<br><br>The numbers were continuously changing.
<br><br>Soon, it broke one hundred.
<br><br>One hundred and fifty, two hundred, two hundred and fifty, three hundred ......
<br><br>The way it looked, the astrological sign was really telling him again the number of heavenly determination.
<br><br>The face of the exterminator was a little disappointed.
<br><br>I thought that one would reveal to him some key to find the tentacle, but did not expect to reveal is nothing nutritious number of heavenly determination.
<br><br>After all, for him now, this number instead of critical.
<br><br>Because although there are many variables, but the variation of the number of heaven-determined other than Fang Xiaotian, there is no other variation, right now re-reveal the number of heaven-determined, is undoubtedly superfluous.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The number of star signs has broken through two hundred and thirty-three.
<br><br>Just when the extinction thought it was about to stop, the number was actually still rising.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, it had reached two hundred and thirty-four people.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Could it be that Teng Xiyuan was not counted as well."
<br><br>Perishable speculated like this.
<br><br>However, to his surprise, the number was actually still moving, not just breaking through two hundred and thirty-four people, but even breaking through three hundred people with the effort of breathing.
<br><br>The world of extermination, who had just dropped his guard, was suddenly dumbfounded.
