Li Mo Xie's monstrous attack went towards the black-robed man.
<br><br>However, the black-robed man still stood as still as ever, without the slightest appearance of trying to resist his attack.
<br><br>"Humph, We are both martial arts experts,but you are so arrogant in the face of my attacks, then suffer the bitter consequences!" Li Mo Xie mouth out cold voice, yet also dare not underestimate the opponent, and used his maximum power.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>What he did not expect was that his monstrous attack fell on the black-robed man, but there was no movement.
<br><br>Not even a single ripple was caused.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Li Mo Xie's guts were almost scared out of his body, instantly withdrawing his attack, his feet chopped the void in an arc and he had swept out.
<br><br>Now he has only one word.
<br><br>Run!
<br><br>Just a breath of time, Li Mo Xie was speeding mid-air was already few thousand feet.
<br><br>At this time, the black-robed man, who had not moved, finally made a move, and the large black robe sleeve slowly lifted.
<br><br>Also at the same time, in a few thousand feet away like the wind fled Li Mo Xie body suddenly froze, it felt like  his body was deep inside mud puddle, suddenly he wasn't able to move his feet.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie's face changed dramatically.
<br><br>But he was creeped out at the back, a majestic force quietly diffused towards him, sucking him from behind. Within a few moments, he had returned to the black-robed man's side, standing upright in mid-air, unable to move.
<br><br>With a face full of white he understood that at this moment he was simply fish meat on this black-robed man's sticky board.
<br><br>"You ...... you you, what the hell are you?"
<br><br>This kind of means, scared Li Mo Xie speech have become stuttering, staring at the black-robed man nervously asked.
<br><br>The black-robed man was silent.
<br><br>"Then what exactly do you want to do to me, and I have no grudge with your Excellency in the past, why do you treat me like this?" Li Mo Xie asked the voice again apprehensively.
<br><br>"No grievances and no hatred?"
<br><br>Finally, under that black robe, for the first time, a voice came out, but the voice had slurred bites and did not sound half as emotional as a human should.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie's face changed dramatically, remembering his behavior at the martial arts school just now, and snapped, "You are Yi Feng of that martial arts school?"
<br><br>"No, no, no. ......"
<br><br>But the next moment, Li Mo Xie shivered and shook his head, "When you first appeared, it was still at that moment of the Yin time, the efficacy of the Heavenly Yin Grand Formation was still there, you could not have chased out from the Martial Hall, unless you were not bound by the Heavenly Yin Grand Formation and your cultivation was Xian ......"
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>As soon as he said this, Li Mo Xie snapped to the impossible, and the words were like telling him the answer to himself, shocked, he asked, "Could you really be an immortal?"
<br><br>"No, I'm just a servant!"
<br><br>Under that black robe, finally came out that hard-sounding and at the same time dry and emotionless voice again.
<br><br>"Servant, servant?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie's mouth stuttered as he pointed at the black robed man and said shiveringly, "You're not Yi Feng?"
<br><br>"Of course I'm not the master."
<br><br>A voice came out from under the black robe.
<br><br>At these words, Li Mo Xie's pupils dilated, his face full of incredulity, this person in front of him was so powerful, he had thought it was the owner of the martial school, Yi Feng, wearing the black robe, yet it was not, but one of Yi Feng's servants?
<br><br>God!
<br><br>Li Mo Xie felt like his brain was about to explode.
<br><br>A master so powerful was actually just a servant of Yi Feng?
<br><br>"Then ...... that Yi Feng?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie held back the shock in his heart and stared at the black-robed man and said word by word: "What is he, really, an immortal?"
<br><br>Asking this sentence with difficulty, Li Mo Xie looked at the black-robed man nervously.
<br><br>"He?"
<br><br>Finally, the black robe slowly raised his head, revealing his true face for the first time.
<br><br>It was a skeleton head without any flesh and blood, only hollow eyes, and what made Li Mo Xie feel his soul fly away was that the skeleton head's lower jaw cocked up, seemingly revealing an evil expression.
<br><br>"Of course he's not an immortal!"
<br><br>Hearing this, Li Moxie immediately breathed a sigh of relief, but also, immortal such existence, how would be in such a small broken place. I'm afraid that there was some kind of change in the Heavenly Yin Grand Formation, and did not manage to bind the people of the martial arts school.
<br><br>But the next moment, the voice coming from under that black robe made Li Mo Xie's soul fly apart.
<br><br>"He, is God!"
