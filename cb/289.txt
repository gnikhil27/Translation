But the next moment.
<br><br>Yun Lang was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Only to see a familiar figure in the middle of that thick fog, flying backwards.
<br><br>It was instantly grabbed by Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Ka!
<br><br>Yun Lang breathing difficulty, straight feel like they can not breathe, throat like a fish thorn stuck in the general, half a day can not say a word, the eyes are also shocked about to burst out.
<br><br>This dwarf lightly raised his hand, actually really will be water line to grab back?
<br><br>This scene, watching Yun Lang is so unreal.
<br><br>Even directly overturned his perception.
<br><br>However, the fact is right in front of him, he saw it with his own eyes, even if it is too unbelievable can not be faked.
<br><br>He instantly understood that this dwarf was a super strong person. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Strong to the point that he did not dare to imagine.
<br><br>After all, what kind of person is the water line, just like this, he was casually captured back.
<br><br>And remembering that he had a mouthful of dwarfs and a mouthful of invalids, he burst into a cold sweat.
<br><br>Both legs.
<br><br>Undisputed shivering.
<br><br>Teeth.
<br><br>Also can not help but hit the stutter.
<br><br>And at this moment, the water line, face is also filled with a look of fear.
<br><br>A moment ago, she was still gloating because she had successfully obtained the demon pellet of the Second Life Demon Emperor, laughing in her heart at how she had come across such a hilarious oddball like Skeleton Ben Wei, and the next moment, she felt that an invisible palm had grabbed her.
<br><br>And with a force that made her completely unable to resist, it grabbed her back.
<br><br>This kind of tactic.
<br><br>Even for her at the peak of the Second Life Martial Emperor, it was unheard of.
<br><br>It was simply beyond her perception of strength.
<br><br>He instantly understood that she was in big trouble.
<br><br>She had offended a super expert who made her feel desperate.
<br><br>"Former ...... senior."
<br><br>She stiffened her head and looked at the black-robed man behind her, forcing a smile to apologize, "Senior, I have innocent eyes, I hope you will be noble, never be ordinary with me, your demon pills I will return to you right now."
<br><br>Saying that, she hurriedly offered the demon pellet with both hands.
<br><br>"Humph, you actually dare to cheat my feelings, this scum is very angry."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crushed the demon pellet of the Second Life Demon Dan with one hand, and an angry voice came out.
<br><br>Shui Xing looked at this scene and trembled all over.
<br><br>You know, the demon pellet is the hardest thing of the demon beast ah, just like this one hand to crush burst.
<br><br>If he was crushed to death, it would be just like playing?
<br><br>She hurriedly kneeled on the ground, trembling and begging for mercy: "Senior senior, it's really my eyes, junior is willing to do anything to appease senior's anger."
<br><br>"I want you to serve me!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said angrily.
<br><br>"Fine, fine, as long as senior calms down, I am willing to do anything for junior." Shui Xing said hurriedly.
<br><br>"Hmph, that's more like it."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's anger then subsided a large part, then sat on the stone with his buttocks, his body also leisurely leaned to the tree trunk behind him, then waved his hand and said, "First give this scum a dance."
<br><br>This made Shui Xing's face full of difficulties.
<br><br>This asked her to play a set of martial arts skills, no problem, you asked her to dance a dance, this is not to kill her?
<br><br>The point is I don't know how to do it either!
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>However, under that black robe, a sulking voice came out.
<br><br>Shui Xing shivered, clenched her red lips and stiffened her head, twisted her water snake waist, and danced awkwardly in front of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>On the side.
<br><br>Yun Lang looked dumbfounded.
<br><br>This is the water line ah.
<br><br>The character that made even his honor scornful, actually really twisted up like this?
<br><br>He drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed that such a thing could happen.
<br><br>Just then, he suddenly noticed that Skeleton Benevolent had tilted his head towards him.
<br><br>He gave a shiver.
<br><br>Flutter.
<br><br>Almost by reflex, his legs fell to the ground.
<br><br>He had a premonition.
<br><br>If he did not, he would die a miserable death.
<br><br>"Is there any wine?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei asked.
<br><br>"Yes there is."
<br><br>Yun Lang hastily brought out his own collection of good wine and took out a few more wine glasses and presented them to Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei poured several cups full, then shouted, "You two, drink for me, and drink to the atmosphere."
<br><br>Seeing this, Shui Xing and Yun Lang hastily picked up their cups, and the two of them clinked their cups heartily, just to make the master in front of them happy.
<br><br>"Well, on the road."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crossed his legs, feeling extremely relaxed and at ease.
<br><br>On his lap, a centipede also twisted his body, his mouth crackling with music.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, hey, little lady, quickly say, who do you love?" At this time, the night wind centipede pointed at Shui Xing and asked loudly.
<br><br>Shui Xing's face was ugly.
<br><br>Gloomy eyes looked over towards the Night Wind Centipede.
<br><br>Since when did a tiny Demon Emperor Centipede dare to speak to her like this?
<br><br>However, the Night Wind Centipede jumped up and shouted, "Aiya, brother, look, this woman she is glaring at me, she is not putting your brother me in her eyes, huh?"
<br><br>At that, Bone Ben Wei head slightly raised, an invisible aura towards the water line pressed.
<br><br>Shui Xing's face turned white with fear and he hurriedly explained, "Senior I was wrong, please calm down."
<br><br>"Then you hurry up and apologize to me." Night Wind Centipede jumped up and shouted, "If you don't apologize you are not putting me in your eyes, not putting me in your eyes is not putting my brother in your eyes."
<br><br>Shui Xing's body trembled with anger, but after taking a look at Bone Ben Wei, she still gritted her teeth and bowed her head reluctantly, "Sorry Lord Demon Emperor, I was wrong."
<br><br>"Hmph, that's more like it." Night Wind Centipede was full of smugness, and then shouted, "By the way, you quickly say, who do you love."
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Water line at this moment really about to cry, but feeling the skeleton Ben Wei body if the aura, she said stiffly: "Love scum senior."
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei was this sentence directly to the sky, gently touched the night wind hard rear shell, nodded his head leisurely said: "good ah little centipede, deep in my heart."
<br><br>At these words, the night wind centipede stood up its small body and raised its chest with a look of satisfaction.
<br><br>Then he inclined his gaze to Yun Lang and shouted, "Kid asked you, who is the most handsome?"
<br><br>Yun Lang gave a jolt and instantly reacted and said, "Back to Lord Demon Emperor, Jagged Man is the most handsome."
<br><br>"Good, you kid will come to things."
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede nodded in satisfaction.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei also tilted his head full of satisfaction, waved his hand and shouted, "Then play music, then dance ......"
<br><br>......
<br><br>And after a short time of rushing, Yi Feng and Desolate Trail finally followed the dog is not far back to Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>But despite the fact that Desolate Trail is trying to hide it, Yi Feng still caught Desolate Trail's somewhat out of place.
<br><br>"Older brother you don't look in a good mood!"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"I'm fine."
<br><br>Desolate Wu Jie forced a smile, but the depths of his eyes were still filled with a gloomy look.
<br><br>Because this woman Shui Xing did not appear, his heart was always uneasy.
<br><br>This one big trouble.
<br><br>I really don't know how to deal with it.
<br><br>Even his heart has made up his mind, after the fog clears, will first send Yi Feng out of the land of chaos.
<br><br>When the time comes to encounter the water line, it is not to drag Yi Feng.
<br><br>Or rather, he desolate no path himself, also better to run away a little ......
<br><br>PS: three more to.
