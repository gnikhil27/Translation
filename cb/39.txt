 "What's going on?" White Puffy got up and frowned.
<br><br>"Miss, come and see, that damned mortal stole your book." Mao Mao shouted.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's face was cold, a compelling aura radiated out from her body, her pretty body turned into a shadow, and instantly came to the front of the room.
<br><br>The door of the room was pushed open.
<br><br>The two of them went towards the bed.
<br><br>Sure enough, at the head of the bed, there was a Dream of the Red Chamber.
<br><br>Seeing this, the chill above Bai Piao Piao's pretty face became even more intense, and her aura was even tinged with a hint of killing intent, as if her most beloved treasure had been tainted.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>But the next instant, she found something wrong, she swept up and returned to her boudoir, when back again, her hands were holding another Red Chamber Dream.
<br><br>"Ah Miss, two books of the Dream of the Red Chamber, this is?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Mao Mao looked at the Dream of the Red Chamber that Bai Piao Piao was holding in another hand, and suddenly opened her small mouth wide.
<br><br>"We misunderstood Yi Gongzi." Bai Piao Piao put away the coldness on his face, took the two Red Chamber Dreams in his hands and compared them one by one, and at once he also found that the two Red Chamber Dreams were different from each other in terms of their newness and oldness.
<br><br>"It seems that this Dream of the Red Chamber, is left by Mr. Yi." Bai Piao Piao tone some surprise: "So Yi Gongzi also read this work."
<br><br>"But, didn't he say last night that he doesn't read books?" Mao Mao asked in confusion.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao nodded, which was also what she was equally puzzled about, and murmured softly, "Maybe, it's because Duke Yi has something difficult to say!"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Mao Mao nodded.
<br><br>"I didn't expect that Duke Yi, as a mortal, would have so much in common with me." She gently stroked the two books, also remembering the mortal man who invited the moon with his wine last night, and softly explained, "Mao Mao, keep that Dream of the Red Chamber for the gongzi, and return it to the gongzi when he comes next time."
<br><br>"Okay." Mao Mao hastily took the Dream of the Red Chamber, and looked at Bai Piao Piao and said, "Miss, looking at your appearance, you didn't really have thoughts about that mortal last night, did you?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao shook her head and smiled bitterly.
<br><br>"And how?"
<br><br>"Although he is talented, but after all, there is a gap with the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber and the Supreme Treasure, I only have a lot of common topics with him, and besides, he is only a mortal."
<br><br>"Oh, okay!"
<br><br>Mao Mao nodded, she also could not understand her lady, so she hurriedly said, "Then I will quickly send a letter down and find the great man you said as soon as possible ......"
<br><br>......
<br><br>The mountain road is rugged.
<br><br>After two more days of bumping around in the mountains, Yi Feng finally finished collecting the herbs he needed.
<br><br>Of course, in addition to what Zhong Qing needs, Yi Feng also collected a lot of other, in general, is full of harvest.
<br><br>After a few more days of running around, he finally arrived back at the martial arts school.
<br><br>Zhong Qing's condition did not improve, on the contrary, it was more serious, Yi Feng did not care to rest, so he hurriedly decocted medicine for Zhong Qing.
<br><br>After drinking the medicine, Zhong Qing's fever legged up a lot, and only then did Yi Feng breathe a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Is Mr. Yi here?"
<br><br>But just sitting down, there was a shout from outside the door.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked out of the door, only to find that it was that butler of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, the butler saw Yi Feng and its respect, not to mention the respect of the president Yin Xiong and Luo Lanxue and others to Yi Feng, just the benefits that Yi Feng's book produced to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, it was worth this.
<br><br>"Oh, it's you guys, what's the matter?" Yi Feng asked with a slightly tired face.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi, this time I'm here to send you the money from the share of the book sale." The butler said respectfully, then took out an exclusive card of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce from his bosom and handed it to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Sir, inside is last month's share of 100,000 gold coins, because I am afraid that you are not good at storing it, it is specially kept in our chamber, so you can use the VIP card to go to our chamber to get the money at any time. Of course, in the future, every month today, we will give you the monthly share of the statistics, all the money will exist in the card of Mr. not less than one."
<br><br>Although he knew that the two people should come to talk about the book, but when he heard the number, Yi Feng could not help but be stunned, and asked rhetorically, "How much did you say? One hundred thousand?"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's question, the housekeeper nodded his head, but his heart was slightly abrupt.
<br><br>Could it be that the gentleman was too little?
<br><br>But he didn't dare to talk too much and hurriedly excused himself and went back to report to the Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Only after the butler left did Yi Feng slow down and look at the card in his hand with some incredulity.
<br><br>For a moment, he laughed out loud.
<br><br>He had only wanted to subsidize his family, but never thought of writing a book to become a god, ah, this instantly 100,000 gold coins into the account, this is enough for him to use for years.
<br><br>And what's even more incredible is that this is only one month!
<br><br>It is simply beautiful ......
<br><br>The company's main goal is to provide a comprehensive range of products and services to the market.
<br><br>Turning back, he found Mao Lin of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce with two people, smiling and coming.
<br><br>"Chairman Mao."
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned slightly, but still maintained a polite nod, "I wonder what President Mao wants to see me about?"
<br><br>"Ahem."
<br><br>Mao Lin coughed awkwardly twice, then said with a smile on his face, "Master Yi, to be honest, this time I came over because I want to apologize to you for what happened last time."
<br><br>Saying that, he waved his palm.
<br><br>The two people behind him opened the box, revealing the golden gold coins.
<br><br>"A whole thousand gold coins, please accept them with a smile, Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Mao Lin waved his hand and laughed bashfully, while looking meaningfully at Yi Feng, a thousand gold coins, he didn't believe that he couldn't impress Yi Feng, this was the income of an ordinary person for a year.
