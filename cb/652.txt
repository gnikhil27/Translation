"Drag it down!"
<br><br>Li Hongtian waved his palm.
<br><br>The personal guards dragged them towards the heavenly prison.
<br><br>They knew exactly how terrifying the Heavenly Prison of the Continent Lord's House was, and immediately began to beg for mercy.
<br><br>"Continent Lord, we are wrong, we are wrong, we are willing to be your cattle and horses, please let us go."
<br><br>Li Hongtian didn't even give a damn about them.
<br><br>Seeing that begging Li Hongtian was useless, they put the straw to save their lives on Lu Chong's body again.
<br><br>"Lu Chong, you must save us!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we have watched you grow up!"
<br><br>"We don't know your cultivation level, it's not strange if you don't know!"
<br><br>"We are a family!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The people have shouted out their voices towards Lu Chong.
<br><br>"A family?"
<br><br>Lu Chong's face was icy cold and he sneered, "When you expelled me from the Great Harmonization Sect, why didn't you guys think about being a family?"
<br><br>"You never thought about what our Lu family has done for you, you only thought about what trouble I would bring you."
<br><br>"You said that you expelled me from the clan for the sake of the clan, I also understand you guys, so I have no resentment or hatred towards you guys."
<br><br>"But just now, I saw your faces clearly."
<br><br>"So from that moment on, I have completely cleared my heart with you guys."
<br><br>"Therefore, I will not interfere with Lord Li's handling of you."
<br><br>"You guys, take care of yourselves!"
<br><br>At those words, Fang Scarf's face was gloomy to the extreme.
<br><br>While struggling, reluctantly continued to shout: "You can't think like this Lu Chong, we are all from the Dahua Clan, you also grew up in the Dahua Clan, we count as your elders, even if we are confused and made some mistakes, you can't be so calculating ah!"
<br><br>These words fell on Lu Chong's ears, only to make him completely wave his hand.
<br><br>The personal guards increased their efforts to drag them down.
<br><br>"Lu Chong you ......"
<br><br>"You actually so unfeeling."
<br><br>"We at least watched you grow up, at least your elders, you actually do not speak half-heartedly."
<br><br>At one time, Fang Scarf and others shouted, "You will be struck by lightning like this, you ...... you shall not die well, quickly release us ......"
<br><br>The shouting gradually weakened down until it was no longer disappearing ......
<br><br>"Brother Lu, there is no need to put them in mind."
<br><br>Li Hongtian hurriedly came forward and said with a smile: "Dahua Sect is a good family, but these black sheep have made a pandemonium."
<br><br>"Brother Lu, I will immediately send someone over to support old Mr. Lu Zun to become the patriarch of the Great Harmony Sect, and at the same time, the crystal mining matters of the West Ning Immortal Continent will be fully handed over to him."
<br><br>Seeing that Lu Chong did not refuse, Li Hongtian sent someone to arrange this matter down with a wave of his palm.
<br><br>When it was over, Li Hongtian was relieved.
<br><br>This matter.
<br><br>It was finally over.
<br><br>With the sunlight, Lu Chong sank his heart and continued to wipe the toilet.
<br><br>Li Hongtian squatted to the side and asked in a small voice: "Brother Lu, there is still this one thing to ask you for advice."
<br><br>"Go ahead."
<br><br>"I have a good friend who is the continent master of the Desolate Immortal Continent." Li Hongtian squatted on the ground and said, "It's been a long time no contact, I contacted him yesterday to catch up, and when chatting, he just happened to tell me about something."
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>Lu Chong asked.
<br><br>"His daughter is married to the Lord of the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent, and although the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent is not the middle three continents, it's not bad in the lower three continents."
<br><br>"And this son-in-law of his, Soga Rentu, has an enemy, called Jiang to."
<br><br>"This Jiang to itself is not a big deal, it is estimated to be a reincarnation of the immortal realm, but things are suspicious in the suspense, this Jiang to clearly know that my friend in the thousand ancient immortal continent, but also take people back to revenge, this is obviously the act of sending heads, really let people puzzled." Li Hongtian said one by one.
<br><br>"Perhaps it is overwhelmed by hatred."
<br><br>Lu Chong said indifferently.
<br><br>"That old friend of mine said the same thing to me, he also just shared an interesting thing with me like that, but the key on the key, my old friend also laughed about it, this Jiang to also brought two human immortals back ......"
<br><br>Hear this.
<br><br>Lu Chong brush toilet palm paused, "you continue to say."
<br><br>"Originally I was just as a joke, but you did not just talk to me up two days ago, told me not to mess with human immortals and earth immortals, so I came to ask for your advice, is there something fishy about this?" Li Hongtian then said.
<br><br>"Are you sure it's two human immortals?"
<br><br>Lu Chong asked.
<br><br>"That's what my old friend said."
<br><br>Li Hongtian said.
<br><br>Lu Chong's eyebrows moved slightly.
<br><br>Putting away the freshly brushed toilet, he got up and walked towards the side hall.
<br><br>Li Hongtian hurriedly followed.
<br><br>"Yah yah nephew ah, are you ready to go?"
<br><br>In the side hall, Gong Chen walked out with a smile.
<br><br>"Senior, may I ask if you know someone named Jiang Zhi?" Lu Chong couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Of course I know her, I was the one who led her to sir's place." Gong Chen laughed, "Speaking of which, Jiang Zhi is a great success nowadays, not only is she valued by sir and sent to guard the transmission port, but also two human immortal seniors were specially sent to help her."
<br><br>"It's really enviable, people are really angry than others!"
<br><br>"Why, suddenly ask about her what?"
<br><br>Gong Chen puzzled.
<br><br>And then looked at Li Hongtian, then asked, "And you, what is shaking for no reason?"
