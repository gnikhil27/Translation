Hearing this, buried four buried five two people crying and laughing.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, in fact, in fact, right, this time we came back is not to enlighten the present will Chaos Tablet!" Burial four rubbed his nose and laughed.
<br><br>"Then you guys are?"
<br><br>Burial One asked as his face changed.
<br><br>"Uh, actually, I also joined the Heaven and Earth Sect, so this time, Old Five and I came back because we were going to invite the three brothers to join the Heaven and Earth Sect with us." Burial Four said.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The faces of the three who were full of enthusiasm suddenly changed.
<br><br>"Old Fourth, Old Fourth how come you actually also ......"
<br><br>Burial One looked at Burial Four with pain and said in a deep voice: "How can you be so confused too, I was worried before that you were under Old Five's compulsion, I didn't expect you to really ......"
<br><br>"Yes old four, I really trust you in vain."
<br><br>"I thought you would bring back the obsessed old five, but I didn't expect you to get trapped yourself." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"You really let us down too much."
<br><br>The three of them blackened their faces, and various painful rebuke sounds came out.
<br><br>"Three brothers, it's not that Old Five and I are confused, it's really because the Heaven and Earth Sect is too powerful!"
<br><br>Burial Four hurriedly explained, "You are also saying this because you have not even been to the Heaven and Earth Sect, if you had arrived at the Heaven and Earth Sect, you would definitely have changed your opinion of the Heaven and Earth Sect and would be eager to join right away."
<br><br>"So I implore, the three brothers to be able to go back to the Heaven and Earth Sect with us."
<br><br>Burial Four said with a sincere face.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"You don't say anymore." Burial One directly interrupted Burial Four's words and said with a cold face, "We are not going to join the Heaven and Earth Sect."
<br><br>"That's right, at this stage what sect can be more important than enlightening the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, you know, the Immortal River Chaos Tablet is something that concerns the Heavenly Dao." Burial Two also said.
<br><br>"You two are really too chilling, your own obsession is not enough, but actually want to drag us down with you." Burial three also sounded angry.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, you guys don't have to be so emotional, really, you just have to go back to the Heaven and Earth Gate with us and take a look." Burial Four explained bitterly.
<br><br>"I said, no way!"
<br><br>Burial One said in a heavy tone, "Now, I also give you two choices."
<br><br>"Either draw a line with the Heaven and Earth Sect now and obediently go back with us to wait for the opening of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, or, you go back to your Heaven and Earth Sect, and we will die with you two."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Burial Four Burial Five's face changed.
<br><br>To draw a line with the Heaven and Earth Sect, how was this possible?
<br><br>"Fourth brother, what should we do?" Burial Five asked with an ugly face.
<br><br>"Alas, big brother is a stickler for how good the Immortal River Chaos Tablet is, but he doesn't know how terrifying the Heaven and Earth Sect is, plus he's in a fit of anger right now, alas ......"
<br><br>"Really can't we wait a little longer, wait for big brother's anger subsided a little before coming back." Burial Four said helplessly.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Burial Five also had to nod helplessly.
<br><br>After making a decision, the two arched their hands and said, "Three brothers, we will leave first, and come back to the three brothers in the future."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>The two buried four and five flew away.
<br><br>"You, you guys ......"
<br><br>The two people this time to disregard the brotherhood, but also to stand firmly in the attitude of the Heaven and Earth Gate, angry burial a chest guilty of pumping.
<br><br>"Big brother big brother don't be angry."
<br><br>Burial two burial three hastened to hold burial one, comforted: "old four old five is after all younger, now misguided is also no way things, wait for the Yan Lian ripe, we two will go to the two of them back."
<br><br>At these words, Burial One took a pill and took a few moments to rest, which made him feel better.
<br><br>Half a day passed.
<br><br>An extremely enthusiastic fluctuation spread out around the heaven and earth.
<br><br>"The Yan Lian is going to ripen."
<br><br>The calmed down Burial One looked at the Yan Lian not far away and said solemnly.
<br><br>"Yes, my tribe has been guarding it for ten thousand years, and this Yan Lian is finally ripe."
<br><br>Burial Two Burial Three also hastily nodded, looking at the Yan Lian that was about to bloom, revealing a look of expectation.
<br><br>Just at this moment, a terrifying wave in the distance came rapidly towards this side.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"I'm afraid the Yan Lian is out of your hands."
<br><br>Along with a heavy voice, a hawk-nosed man landed and came.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>The three Burial One's faces changed as they asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Wow, don't you recognize them so soon?" The man laughed icily.
<br><br>"You, you are also the Heaven-defined person, Fang Xiaotian from the blue light pillar?" Burial Two recognized this man and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Not bad, it's me!"
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>"What do you want?" Burial One asked in a cold voice.
<br><br>"Naturally, I have my eyes on this Inferno Lotus."
<br><br>"Of course, it is also because I want to take away your qi."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Fang Xiaotian's voice sank, "Why are a few of you tiny Heavenly Immortals able to sit on the Red Immortal Pillar, while I, a top-level Golden Immortal, am reduced to the Blue Immortal Pillar?"
<br><br>"Hmph, is what the immortal pillar everything is determined by the sky, even if you are stronger than us, it is still unchangeable, blame can only be blamed on your lack of luck and talent." Burial two cold voice said.
<br><br>"That's why I want to take away your qi."
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian sneered.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Burial One grimaced and said soberly, "Do you know that we are all heaven-determined people, the heaven-determined number is unchangeable, even if you kill us, there are always variables influencing in the underworld, you can't kill us!"
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>"But I never wanted to kill you guys in the first place."
<br><br>"I just thought that if I robbed your Yan Lian and taught you guys a hard lesson, perhaps I would be able to seize your Qi and leap up and enter the red pillar of light?" Fang Xiaotian sneered.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Burial One and Three trembled with anger.
<br><br>Even though they were facing a powerful Golden Immortal strength person, how could their tribe be willing to give up the Yan Lian, which they had been guarding for ten thousand years, so easily.
<br><br>"We are not going to let you get away with this."
<br><br>The three people's Qi surged.
<br><br>They surrounded Fang Xiaotian in the middle in an encircling position.
<br><br>With swords drawn, the two sides finally collided.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Even if the three brothers cooperate more than tacitly, in front of absolute strength, everything is just a delusion.
<br><br>Almost instantly, the three brothers were sent flying to the ground by Fang Xiaotian, spitting blood from their mouths.
<br><br>"Yo, it seems like time is up."
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian glanced at the Yan Lian, sneered, and was about to go forward to pick it.
<br><br>"You stop."
<br><br>The three brothers hissed out and climbed up to go forward.
<br><br>But then, they were knocked away by Fang Xiaotian's hand, and could only fall limp on the ground, watching with red eyes as Fang Xiaotian picked the Yan Lian down.
<br><br>"Look, this is the heaven-destined person among the red immortal pillars, so unbearable?"
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian mocked with a face full of disdain, and even more deliberately raised the Yan Lian in his hand and said leisurely, "How about that, isn't it very ungrateful?"
<br><br>"What a pity it is, the Yan Lian that your tribe has been guarding for ten thousand years is in my pocket like this ......"
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian laughed arrogantly.
<br><br>Faced with mockery, the three Buried One could only red-eyed, clenched their fists tightly, and stared deadly at Fang Xiaotian with hateful eyes.
<br><br>"Oh yes, you have five brothers, and I heard that you five brothers have always been close, now how come there are only three of you and two losers?" Fang Xiaotian did not hesitate to strike.
<br><br>This blow.
<br><br>What's more, it made Burial One and Three vomit blood.
<br><br>This was also considered a good coincidence that Fang Xiaotian pierced the heart of the three.
<br><br>"What, not calling them out? If the five of you had gathered together, maybe it wouldn't be so bad." Fang Xiaotian continued to strike.
<br><br>He just wanted to strike the sharpness of several people.
<br><br>So that he could use it to deprive the three of their qi.
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>Looking at the three people who hated him to the bone but could not do anything about it, he could not help but laugh wildly.
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, two figures came flying from outside the sky.
<br><br>It is buried four buried five two people.
<br><br>Seeing this, the three people full of hatred, Burial One raised their heads expectantly to look at the two brothers who had arrived.
<br><br>"Yo."
<br><br>"Really came?"
<br><br>"But what's the use, it's just two more to send me Qi luck!" Fang Xiaotian sneered.
<br><br>At these words, the expectant Burial One trio, too, instantly planted their heads in disappointment.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>Burial four burial five two people back and what is the use?
<br><br>In the face of the Golden Immortal, they can still save the wilderness to snatch the Yan Lian back?
<br><br>I'm afraid that, as Fang Xiaotian said, it's just two more gifts of luck!
