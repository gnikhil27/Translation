Skeleton Benway blinked and looked at the dog.
<br><br>"You actually have a son?"
<br><br>"No, not one." The dog raised his head with a sweaty face and hurriedly explained, "It's a bunch."
<br><br>"Watt?"
<br><br>"A bunch?"
<br><br>Bones asked with a glare, "You're with me every day, where did you get a bunch of sons?"
<br><br>"Sons of joy?"
<br><br>"I, just last time at the martial arts school, the master forced me to bang Ao Qingcheng, then he went back and ......" the dog explained.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei then nodded and said, "Then in that case, I, Bone Ben Wei, also have a nephew?"
<br><br>"Hahahaha, a great joy, a great joy!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The sound of hahaha laughter came from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Congratulations to big brother, congratulations to second brother."
<br><br>And Black Bear and Night Wind Centipede also hurriedly emitted congratulatory voices.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, same congratulations, after all, isn't this also your nephew?"
<br><br>Bonehead Benjamin laughed loudly.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, it is also our nephew, same joy, same joy, hahahaha, we all have nephews."
<br><br>The black bear and the centipede reacted with the same excited sound coming from them.
<br><br>Especially the black bear.
<br><br>Just a moment ago, he was scared to death, but this moment he not only recognized a good big brother, but also directly became an uncle.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, is this thing so happy?" <br><br>"I'm not sure if I'm happy, but I'm still panicking."
<br><br>"Oops, calm down."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei came over and patted the dog and said in a serious tone, "People generally come over like this, just be normal, just like the snail in that yard back then you know?"
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>The dog looked at Bone Benevolent in confusion.
<br><br>"That guy was like that then too, but he was much more ruthless than you, his daughter-in-law gave birth to a world directly, a full three trillion people, and he still came through like that?"
<br><br>"So yeah, calm down, just calm down."
<br><br>Skeleton Benevolent said softly to comfort.
<br><br>"Wow, okay, so this pile of sons to recognize?" The dog asked.
<br><br>"Acknowledge."
<br><br>"Of course you should admit it, it was your seed, so why not?"
<br><br>Bones Benway said solemnly.
<br><br>"Then in that case, I'm afraid I have to go back to the Heaven-Devouring Demon Wolf tribe once." The dog said, "Just now the people in the tribe told me that this pile of my sons were born with a vision of heaven and earth, so people from the Western Demon Forest said they wanted to take them away."
<br><br>"What the hell, people from the Western Demon Forest want to take away my nephews?" Bone Ben Wei's voice sank and he couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"The person who came said it was my son who was gifted, and it was a waste of talent to put them inside the tribe, saying that they were brought to the Western Demon Forest to be able to train them better." The dog explained.
<br><br>"Bullshit."
<br><br>"That broken West Demon Forest has two or three bugs of all sizes, are they qualified to teach my nephew?" Bone Ben Wei said angrily, "Go, go together, get rid of that bunch of creepy crawlies in the West Demon Forest, then pick up my nephew and a few of us will personally train him."
<br><br>"Right, our nephew that bunch of broken demon beasts where qualified to teach, let's go to the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe right now." The night wind centipede raised its head and shouted.
<br><br>Just as the brothers were shouting, Yi Feng suddenly walked over from not far away.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The centipede hurriedly plopped down.
<br><br>And the black bear even crouched aside and started shivering.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng just glanced at them indifferently.
<br><br>This centipede he found long ago, so he has also long seen less and less.
<br><br>As for the extra worm, it doesn't matter to him.
<br><br>After all, this broken skeleton likes to play with animals and he knows all about it.
<br><br>"Going out, right?"
<br><br>Easy Feng looked at them and said.
<br><br>"Mmmmmmmmm."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei nodded his head like a chicken chasing rice.
<br><br>"Go ahead."
<br><br>Easy Feng waved his hand while looking at a few beasts bolted to the side and said, "But get out and keep an eye on them by the way."
<br><br>Seeing this, Bone Ben Wei's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>Busy nodded his head.
<br><br>"That's right."
<br><br>Just as he left, Yi Feng suddenly turned his head, remembered something, and said, "If you have time, you can help me go catch two more beasts back, similar to these ones."
