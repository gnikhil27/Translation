But after thinking about it, he still put his palm down.
<br><br>Such a good big baby, last night he wasted half a packet, the remaining half a packet he really can not afford to use in.
<br><br>"This guy Berserk Pill's duration is only a quarter of an hour, hang in there!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor gritted his teeth.
<br><br>At the same time, his palm waved and took out a Zun Pin magic treasure.
<br><br>As soon as the Zun Pin magic treasure came out, it immediately radiated light around the circumference of the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This is a defensive magic treasure of honorable grade.
<br><br>And it was obvious that the Heaven Devouring Emperor did not intend to fight Ao Bi Fang, but to save that half pack of spicy strips, he passively defended in order to be able to last for a quarter of an hour.
<br><br>"Vajra Shield?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang saw Devouring Heavenly Emperor sacrifice this magic treasure, his pupils slightly shrunk, but then, it was a cold laugh, "You think you have the Vajra Shield, you think you are safe and sound?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Hmph, it's true that I can't block a real Demon Emperor, but it's still no problem to block a half-assed person like you for a quarter of an hour." The Heaven Devouring Emperor shouted disdainfully.
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's voice suddenly turned eerie.
<br><br>That gloomy face was even covered with fierceness and madness!
<br><br>Also at the same time as his voice fell, he who was on the ground suddenly rose slowly towards the sky, accompanied by a bizarre hand seal, and his mouth began to chant incomprehensible talismanic sounds.
<br><br>"A bag of rice to resist a few floors ......"
<br><br>"A bag of rice to resist the second floor ......"
<br><br>"A bag of rice to me to give more ......"
<br><br>"A bag of rice to me to wash ......"
<br><br>"Mud at the mouth ......"
<br><br>"Who gives you a bag of rice Yo ......"
<br><br>With a talismanic sound out, the whole ground roared, then began to shake the sky and earth, flying sand and rocks.
<br><br>And the crowd under the field, seems to be aware of what, one by one, reveals the color of fear.
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Demon Emperor, who was hiding behind the Vajra Shield, stared at Ao Bi Fang with a deadly stare and shouted with a face full of incredulity: "This, this is ......"
<br><br>And before the Devouring Heaven Emperor's voice completely fell, Ao Bi Fang, who was already high in the sky, finally dropped the last hand seal in his hand.
<br><br>After the hand seal fell, a huge fire ball coalesced under his hands, blocking the entire sky.
<br><br>"Spicy Heavenly Sen!"
<br><br>With a soft shout, the fire ball in his hands roared down.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>Before the attack arrived, under this powerful fluctuation, the ground was already collapsed by the powerful pressure, spreading out a crack.
<br><br>"Run!"
<br><br>"Run!"
<br><br>And the people on both sides of the river, whether it was the Red Sun lineage or the Imperial lineage, all came out with ghostly cries and began to run away.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>This attack finally fell towards the Heaven Devouring Demon Emperor.
<br><br>The ground violently collapsed, forming a hundred feet deep crater, countless demon wolves of the two veins flew into oblivion, and the majestic qi energy spread out in all directions.
<br><br>Sand and rocks flew in all directions.
<br><br>Countless surviving demon wolves were blown up into the sky, while many buildings and trees not far away were also razed to the ground in an instant.
<br><br>After a long time, a long time.
<br><br>The whole battlefield is considered a little calm, gas smoke is slowly dispersed.
<br><br>In the hundred-foot deep pit, the Heaven Devouring Emperor was lying dying inside the pit, his chest collapsed, and his mouth was spitting blood.
<br><br>Next to him, his Vajra shield also became broken.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the crowd of the Red Sun Clan emitted an overwhelming shout.
<br><br>The Imperial Clan lineage, on the other hand, was covered with the color of death.
<br><br>In the end, was it his imperial lineage that lost?
<br><br>High in the air, Ao Bi Fang looked indifferently at the Heaven Devouring Emperor in the pit, tightening his pupils, filled with disdain.
<br><br>"Today, the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe will change its dynasty, and my Red Sun lineage, will become the new royal family."
<br><br>"And you, Ao Zhong, will eventually become a stepping stone for the rise of my Red Sun lineage, if you kneel down and cut yourself, I promise not to drive your lineage to extinction!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's icy voice shook the sky, as if he had given judgment to the Devouring Heaven Emperor.
<br><br>But yet, a mocking voice came out from that deep pit.
<br><br>"You are really deceiving people too much!"
<br><br>"Really pushing me too, you don't really think you're bound to win, do you?"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang sneered and coldly said, "Although I don't know why you still don't concede defeat and still have the courage to say such words, I don't think you still have any means to turn around at this moment, today you will only end up dead!"
<br><br>"Fine, fine!"
<br><br>The Devouring Emperor spat out a mouthful of blood foam, forced his injured body to crawl up, palms while pulling out the hidden compartment of his clothes, while raising the corners of his mouth sneer: "You forced me to do this, originally wanted to send you on your way after a quarter of an hour, but this quarter of an hour is really too slow ah!
<br><br>"In that case, it's not my fault!"
<br><br>The Emperor of Devouring Heaven finally took out the spicy strips in his clothes, his face flashed with madness, and without saying a word, he bit down the remaining half of the packet.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, the aura on the Heaven Devouring Emperor's body was climbing, his body was shrouded with a fiery aura, and the demonic Qi lingering around him turned into a fiery red.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang, who originally looked light-hearted, saw this scene and his face finally changed drastically.
<br><br>"Demon, demon daddy?"
<br><br>"How can you suddenly reach Demon Dignity?"
<br><br>"My Red Sun lineage's heaven defying Berserk Pill made me pay half of my life span as a price to allow me to briefly climb to a realm close to Demon Exalted, what is this thing you have that can actually allow you to directly become Demon Exalted?"
<br><br>"This can't be, this can't be!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang stared in disbelief, almost roaring out at this moment, expressing his disbelief.
<br><br>"There is nothing impossible!"
<br><br>"Today, is the day of your death."
<br><br>As his voice fell, the Heaven Devouring Emperor transformed into a fiery red figure and swept up into the air.
<br><br>A fist was struck out.
<br><br>Accompanied by flaming demonic Qi, it landed on Ao Bi Fang's chest with a bang.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's eyes were wide with fear.
<br><br>With this punch, he actually didn't even have the strength to fight, and the enormous power with that fiery demonic energy poured out on his body.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>This punch directly knocked Ao Bi Fang out ten thousand feet away.
<br><br>But before he could hit the ground, the fiery red Heaven Devouring Emperor followed him and reappeared on top of Ao Bi Fang's head.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Splashing with a fiery red light, the Heaven Devouring Emperor landed with a vicious kick.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The ground exploded and smashed into a huge deep crater.
<br><br>At this moment, the body of Ao Bi Fang, who was trampled under his feet, was deformed and trembling all over.
<br><br>However, he stared at the Heaven Devouring Emperor with bloodshot pupils, staring at him with a deadly stare.
<br><br>"That ......"
<br><br>"What the hell is that that can actually give you the strength of a Demon Emperor!?"
<br><br>"Then I will let you die in peace."
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor looked at Ao Bi Fang at his feet from above and said coldly, "Listen carefully, this is an immortal object that my son begged for me from a high person."
<br><br>"Spicy strips!"
<br><br>"Spicy ...... strips!?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang stared at his eyes, and his mouth chanted these two words with difficulty.
<br><br>In the next moment, the Heaven Devouring Emperor's fist that was spreading fire light landed on top of his head.
<br><br>......
