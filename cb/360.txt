At once, the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan burst out with strong cheers.
<br><br>Ao Qing didn't even say a few words and made a Demon Emperor kneel down in fear, does that mean that their Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan is not even afraid of Demon Emperors?
<br><br>In the past, this was something they didn't even dare to think about.
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li knelt down on the ground and waited for the sentencing.
<br><br>Instead, Bone Ben Wei and the others didn't even look at him, but were looking around openly.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow."
<br><br>Just then, there came a sound of ow ow ow ow, the crowd will look at, and immediately found seven coyotes running over happily.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow, daddy is back, which one is daddy?"
<br><br>After the seven coyotes came to the crowd, they raised their heads in unison and scanned the crowd for targets.
<br><br>Seeing these seven spiritual and cheerful coyotes, Ao Qing, who was somewhat unsure of how to face them, suddenly showed a loving look in his eyes.
<br><br>"Is this, is this my child?" Ao Qing's voice trembled a little and asked toward the surrounding people. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yes third prince, that's your child."
<br><br>"They are powerfully gifted, born with the cultivation of demon kings, they are extraordinary heavenly talents!"
<br><br>At these words, Ao Qing became even more excited.
<br><br>But before he could speak, the seven little wolves pounced towards him.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow, daddy."
<br><br>One coyote kissed on Ao Qing's face, and an aunt-like smile appeared on Ao Qing's face with joy.
<br><br>"Huh, daddy, who are these, how come I haven't seen them before?" A coyote looked at Bones Benevolent, Black Bear Creamer, and Night Wind Centipede and asked.
<br><br>"Wow, they are my brothers."
<br><br>"This one, is my big brother, you guys should call Big Daddy."
<br><br>"This is the third, you guys should call Third Uncle, and Fourth Uncle."
<br><br>Ao Qing patiently introduced himself towards the seven young wolves.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow, Big Daddy, Third Uncle and Fourth Uncle."
<br><br>The seven coyotes were not afraid of being born at all, so they rubbed towards Bone Ben Wei and the others, especially Bone Ben Wei's body, which dropped three or four of them.
<br><br>"Big Daddy, you look the most powerful, did you bring gifts for the babies!"
<br><br>"Yeah, yeah, me too, big daddy must have brought me a present."
<br><br>The young wolves passed out their voices towards Skeleton Benway.
<br><br>"There are presents, of course there are presents."
<br><br>Looking at these little wolves who were intimate with him, Bone Ben Wei also felt like it from the bottom of his heart, and immediately opened his mouth and agreed.
<br><br>"Yeah, Big Daddy has brought gifts, come on!"
<br><br>Seeing that Bone Ben Wei had a present, all the seven little wolves wrapped themselves around him.
<br><br>"Good, you guys stand in a row." Skeleton Ben Wei said.
<br><br>The seven little wolves obediently lined up and looked at Bone Burnett expectantly.
<br><br>"The gift will be given to you soon, but before I give it to you, I want to ask you a question first." Skeleton Ben Wei said in a gagging manner.
<br><br>The seven coyotes looked at Bone Burnett with puzzled eyes.
<br><br>"Let me ask you guys, in this world, who is the most handsome?" Bones Ben Wei asked softly.
<br><br>The seven coyotes blinked their eyes and opened their mouths and shouted, "Of course it's Big Daddy, Big Daddy is the most handsome, Big Daddy is the most handsome in the world, the most beautiful boy in the world."
<br><br>This answer immediately made Bones Ben Wei float with laughter.
<br><br>"Since you little guys are so delightful, I'll let you become immortal on the ground."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei laughed, then raised his palm to the sky and fiercely grabbed it.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>In a flash, the clouds in the sky turned, golden light shone, and the majestic power of Immortal Irrigation enveloped towards this plain.
