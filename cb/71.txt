"Crouch crouch, look at it."
<br><br>Wang Xuan stopped in his tracks and looked at the two women with a salivating face, pushed Yi Feng with his elbow and said quietly, "Dude, these two are the real best, if I could have one, it would be worth my while to die."
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng immediately white Wang Xuan a glance.
<br><br>This buddy sea king?
<br><br>Obviously there is a good one beside him, still thinking about the other, fortunately he that Rui Xiaoyu did not hear.
<br><br>"Alas, but this kind of beauty we can only think about, and I do not know who is so lucky to eat with them." Wang Xuan although in mind, but also have self-awareness, lost patted Yi Feng's shoulder.
<br><br>However, just as his voice fell, the two women came straight towards this side.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>The two women's voices came out at the same time.
<br><br>One was full of rhythm.
<br><br>This scene tickled the hearts of the people watching.
<br><br>A sour smell in the entire restaurant and filled up.
<br><br>Of course, the most incredible is next to Wang Xuan, the entire mouth opened up, mouth are enough to contain an egg, will be shocked to look at the side of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Dude, I didn't see it, you're a cow!"
<br><br>Wang Xuan looked at Yi Feng meaningfully and gave a thumbs up, that gaze was really admirable.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and looked at him, then said towards the two women, "Let's go, go eat first."
<br><br>After bidding farewell to Wang Xuan, Yi Feng, under the envious gaze of the crowd, came to the reserved table, and to show his appreciation, this was the best seat.
<br><br>It was eye-catching and outstanding.
<br><br>Soon, a plate of delicious food was served.
<br><br>"Sir, eat this."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er chucked a piece of meat to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing this, Demon Ling'er's face changed and also chucked a bite of the dish into Yi Feng's bowl, saying reluctantly, "Sir, eat this for me."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er frowned, her pretty torso leaned toward Yi Feng, and actually took a bite of the dish and personally fed it toward Yi Feng's mouth.
<br><br>"No need for that."
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of embarrassment and pushed back, but the generosity was hard to resist, so he had to open his mouth.
<br><br>The demon spirit's face showed frost and glared at Mao Yun'er grimly, but in front of Yi Feng she did not dare to act rashly, but also secretly compared, if she demon spirit was compared to a mortal woman, then she also had no face to meet Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"Sir, you're tired of walking on the way here just now, I'll rub your shoulders."
<br><br>Saying that, he put down his chopsticks, propped up his delicate body to come behind Yi Feng, and put his jade hand on Yi Feng's shoulder and gently pressed and rubbed it.
<br><br>"Grass!"
<br><br>"Fuck!"
<br><br>"Eat Nima it."
<br><br>"Laozi eat a meal is still being fed dog food."
<br><br>Seeing this scene, countless male diners have slapped down the chopsticks in their hands and left the restaurant in anger.
<br><br>Wang Xuan, who was on the other side, also looked at the same eyes straight.
<br><br>Damn talent ah!
<br><br>In front of this buddy, he Wang Xuan what things are not, looking at the next Rui Xiaoyu, half of it does not smell good.
<br><br>"Have you had enough?"
<br><br>The two women's secret rivalry, Yi Feng is not stupid, how can not see, at first can still tolerate a, but the two women are more and more excessive, so let his voice with a trace of sulking.
<br><br>Of course, not his steel, just the gesture shown by the two women fighting, too deliberate, which is very let Yi Feng not too comfortable.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, immediately scared the two women jumped.
<br><br>At the same time obediently sat back in their seats, not daring to say another word.
<br><br>"You guys don't mind either, I didn't mean to say you guys."
<br><br>Seeing the two women in this way, Yi Feng comforted them again, and then continued to start eating.
<br><br>Although the action did not move again, but the two women's eyes have been fighting, after all, the two have not been divided into a winner and loser.
<br><br>The two of them have not been able to tell the difference.
<br><br>Since this is the case, she could not care less ......
<br><br>Then she directly and dryly shouted, "Sir."
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted his head and looked at her.
<br><br>"Tonight, let's fight the landlord together, right?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er lightly moved her beautiful eyes and looked at Yi Feng with a lot of style and asked, saying this, even she, Demon Ling'er, could not help but have a blush spring up on her face.
