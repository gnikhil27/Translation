"Old Wu, how are you doing?"
<br><br>In the drizzling rain, Chu Mad Lion and Sun Zhuge were both emitting worried voices.
<br><br>Since being trapped here by Li Mo Xie, the three had long been in a wretched state, and due to the great formation, the three could only step on an inch of ground under their feet to support themselves bitterly.
<br><br>The two of them could still rely on their cultivation for a while, but Wu Yonghong's cultivation was ruined, long ago there is no difference with mortals, long ago lying on the ground dying.
<br><br>Seeing Wu Yonghong's consciousness getting blurred, Chu Wild Lion and Sun Zhuge looked at each other and both transmitted the few strengths in their bodies.
<br><br>"You guys, what are you doing?"
<br><br>Feeling the power pouring into his body, Wu Yonghong regained a lot of consciousness, but shouted anxiously, "This formation not only seals the cultivation, but also closes the channels for you guys to draw in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, you guys don't have much power already, why do you need to make a big fuss over me, an invalid?"
<br><br>At these words, Chu Wild Lion and Sun Zhuge both let out a bitter smile, but the transmission of power did not stop.
<br><br>"Last time in the Guandu Secret Realm, if it wasn't for you, Old Wu, I, Chu Wild Lion, would have been long gone." Chu Wild Lion said, "Why say this aren't we brothers, although me might not make it alive, but regardlessly until the last moment, we will not leave you old Wu."
<br><br>"Old Chu is right, we brothers do not need to be so polite." Sun Zhuge likewise said, "When I fought with my enemies and fought alone, if it wasn't for you, Old Wu, who arrived in time, I would have likewise been long gone."
<br><br>"You, you guys ......"
<br><br>Forgive Wu Yonghong's state of mind, to this brink, also can not help but eyes with tears, grateful to look at the two old friends.
<br><br>"Alas!"
<br><br>"It's not enough for us to die, it's just that I'm worried about sir!" Sun Zhuge said worriedly as he finished transmitting power for Wu Yonghong.
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong's face was darkened again, and he was even more ashamed, "I'm the one who dragged seniors down, if I had seen through Li Mo Xie earlier, I wouldn't have caused this kind of trouble for Mr. ah, it's all my fault!"
<br><br>"Don't worry, Mr. lucky man has a heavenly destiny, besides, he is so powerful, is not a Li Mo Xie can harm." Chu Mad Lion said comfortingly from the side.
<br><br>"Let's hope so!"
<br><br>The crowd sighed, but their hearts were still thick with worry.
<br><br>Because if it was usual, naturally, they were not afraid that Li Mo Xie could harm Yi Feng, but with such a terrifying formation like the Heavenly Yin Grand Formation, the situation was still not optimistic ah!
<br><br>Rain.
<br><br>I don't know when it stopped.
<br><br>Suddenly, Sun Zhuge seemed to see something and suddenly shouted in surprise.
<br><br>"Look."
<br><br>At that, the other two people also looked their eyes over.
<br><br>It was found that in the distance, halfway up the mountain, a human figure was slowly walking towards this side.
<br><br>Upon recognizing the figure, the three almost jumped up in excitement.
<br><br>"Mister."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, it's sir, it's actually sir!"
<br><br>When Wu Yonghong saw this scene, his body trembled and he laughed like he was crazy.
<br><br>"I told you so." And Chu wild lion is not much better, a thigh, full of excitement said: "Mr. so strong, and how will be able to hurt Li Mo Xie, that Li Mo Xie afraid long ago by Mr. to solve, and know our situation, deliberately came to save us."
<br><br>At one time, the three old men who had been together for 10,000 years were filled with hot tears.
<br><br>The road is very bad, the ground is everywhere is swampy, so Yi Feng walk is not fast. Slowly and leisurely walk under a long time, this is to see three figures in front.
<br><br>"Hey, isn't that Old Brother Wu and the others?"
<br><br>"What a coincidence!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of surprise, in this big mountain encountered acquaintances, how to have to say hello to these old brothers ah!
<br><br>So, Yi Feng walked straight towards the three of them.
<br><br>However, when the three saw the route Yi Feng took, their faces changed in a hurry, and they quickly raised their voices.
<br><br>"Sir careful, there are formations ......"
<br><br>"Do not walk directly over ah sir!"
<br><br>Shouting at the same time, the three are paired with a hand dance, afraid that Yi Feng does not realize the seriousness.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>This distance is still quite far for Yi Feng, light hear them shouting, but simply can not hear clearly what they are shouting.
<br><br>"I guess it's to say hello ......"
<br><br>"But it is really enthusiastic ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng thought so, and walked towards them with a smile on his face.
<br><br>"It's over!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the three people's faces changed greatly.
<br><br>One had to know that, among them, there was not only a formation arranged by Li Mo Xie, but also a natural grand formation and countless ancient formations due to the terrain and the ancient battlefield.
<br><br>Although Mr. strength is strong, but a careless into, will also encounter big trouble ah!
