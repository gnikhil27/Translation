See the situation.
<br><br>The crowd in the room focused their eyes on the brick.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Without exception, they all drew a breath of cold air in unison.
<br><br>The ancient aura emanating from it made them instantly recognize that it was an immortal weapon.
<br><br>After following Yi Feng for so long, it was indeed no big deal for Yi Feng to be able to take out an immortal weapon.
<br><br>But to have this standard for every brick of establishing a sect, on the other hand, made them sit up and take notice.
<br><br>This kind of gesture, I'm afraid the immortal palace in the immortal world can't compare to it.
<br><br>"Old Zhao, go go go, let's hurry up and find wood for the gentleman." Old Qian hurriedly got up and greeted Old Zhao, saying in a hurry.
<br><br>"Eh, good, good, we'll leave right away."
<br><br>Old Zhao also got up and promised. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Originally for this task given to them by Yi Feng, they still felt quite daunting, but compared to the task of Ye Bei and others, this task of theirs is simply child's play!
<br><br>After giving Ye Bei and the others a compassionate look, the two old men left with quick steps.
<br><br>"This way, Ye Bei you bring a group of people to follow me to burn the kiln to make bricks, old tube you two will follow the standard I said before, go find workers."
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed, remembered something and added: "Remember, in addition to having strength, the age better not be too old."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng took Ye Bei and others to find a place to burn the kiln.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng and shake the sky Que face full of difficulties stunned on the spot.
<br><br>Strength to have.
<br><br>Age can not be too old.
<br><br>Mouth chattering, the two men turned their gaze to the little brother running the hall and walked over with smiles on their faces, pulling it aside.
<br><br>"Little brother, lend a step to talk."
<br><br>The two old men said with a smile.
<br><br>The canteen boy walked aside with them and looked at them suspiciously.
<br><br>"Ahem, little brother, may I take the liberty to ask, what is your current cultivation level?" The two old men asked nervously, carrying a heart waiting for the little brother runner's reply.
<br><br>After all, according to Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>The workers should be recruited according to this little brother as the standard.
<br><br>So this little brother has how much cultivation, it means that they recruit workers will be what cultivation.
<br><br>"It's okay to tell the two old brothers, just that I said it, you two do not laugh at me." The little brother ran the hall coyly touched his nose, coyly quite a bit embarrassed.
<br><br>Seeing this, Guan Yunpeng two people slightly relieved.
<br><br>Looking at this, this little brother's cultivation level should not be too high.
<br><br>In this way, their pressure will be much less, they only need to find someone to lower the age is.
<br><br>So, Guan Yunpeng hurriedly said comfortingly, "Don't worry little brother, we definitely won't laugh at you, just say it."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Little brother nodded coyly and said embarrassedly, "I am not talented, I have followed you for a whole year and a half before being promoted from Martial King to Sixth Life Martial Emperor, to put it bluntly, I am just a small transparent."
<br><br>"Six?"
<br><br>"Only ...... Sixth Life Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>Upon hearing these words, the unprepared Guan Yunpeng almost spat out a mouthful of old blood. Shaking Heavenly Que even slipped on his paws and fell headfirst into the lake.
<br><br>"Ugh, old brother."
<br><br>The running hall boy hurriedly pulled Shake Tian Que up.
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que did not care about his own wretchedness, staring at the runner little brother with shivering eyes, he asked, "You you, you, what cultivation level did you say you were?"
<br><br>"Six lives, a small six lives."
<br><br>The runner little brother said.
<br><br>Once again confirmed, the two people of Shaking Heavenly Que wanted to die.
<br><br>Wouldn't that mean that their next criteria for finding a worker not only couldn't be too old, but also needed to have at least a Sixth Life Martial Emperor's cultivation?
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Even if they turned the Immortal River Continent upside down, there might not be so many of them.
<br><br>Even if there were so many, would they be able to find them?
<br><br>You know, to reach this level of cultivation, which is not a person of outstanding talent!
<br><br>This task, too heavy ah!
<br><br>"Two old brothers, still the same thing, although my cultivation is a little lower, but do not laugh at me." The runner boy said nervously.
<br><br>"Yes, it's a bit lower ......"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que two people pumping mouth, a time can not afford to beat this guy, have not seen so angry.
<br><br>But then what can be done, in the face of Mr. account, even if it is difficult they have to do their best.
<br><br>"Qing ah, so boring ah!"
<br><br>On the edge of the lake, skeleton Ben Wei crossed his legs, mouth with a dog tail grass lying on the ground, lazily said.
<br><br>"It's boring."
<br><br>The dog opened his hind legs, peed under a tree, and echoed.
<br><br>"Two brothers, why don't we walk the birds."
<br><br>A centipede came out of the grass roots and said with a smile.
<br><br>"What's there to walk a silly hybrid bird?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei glanced at the black feather tethered to the side, and the other three demon immortals of the Western Demon Forest, and said with a face full of disdain.
<br><br>Just after he finished, he suddenly noticed something.
<br><br>The dog-tailed grass in his mouth spat, and got up to look his gaze into the distance.
<br><br>Not far away in the rock crevice, a large black chopped buttocks abruptly placed there, and also shaking from time to time, extremely conspicuous.
<br><br>"Oooooo, what's wrong with this island."
<br><br>"I'm really just a cute little bear, ah, woo woo woo, this one horrible thing so much, still let's not let live ......"
<br><br>"Can't see me."
<br><br>"You can't see me, mama mama coax, can't see me."
<br><br>The black bear shrunk his head into the slit, arching his buttocks trembling prayers.
<br><br>However, just as he was chanting, a foot suddenly flew in and kicked him in the buttocks.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The black bear subconsciously jumped up and instantly saw the presence of the few that terrified him.
<br><br>"Ah."
<br><br>"Don't come any closer, you guys."
<br><br>"I'm very powerful, be careful I lock your throats."
<br><br>"Hey."
<br><br>"Ha ......."
<br><br>While panicking, the black bear gestures and transmits a fierce voice.
<br><br>But when he saw that he couldn't bluff these few, he suddenly became abashed again and lay down on the ground holding his heart.
<br><br>"Brother, brother."
<br><br>"I'm just a harmless little bear."
<br><br>"I'm wrong, don't come over, ouch ouch I can't, I can't, I'm dying, I'm dying ......"
<br><br>After saying that with his tongue out, he laid down on the ground and didn't move a muscle ......
<br><br>"Yo ho?"
<br><br>"A connoisseur, huh?"
<br><br>"I night wind in this regard in this life has not admired anyone, you are the first."
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the dog's head, the night wind centipede drilled out, immediately came out the voice of appreciation.
