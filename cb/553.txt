Outside the city walls, the dozens of people leading the army approaching the Cloud Top Empire but had a quarrel.
<br><br>Over who was going to fight the World Extermination and the king of the Cloud Top Empire.
<br><br>"All the senior brothers have more or less practiced since they left the Heaven and Earth Sect, let the ones who haven't practiced come?" Jia Jia Qin interrupted several people's quarrel and said.
<br><br>"Who has not practiced their hands?"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin pointed to the thousands of yellow sky beasts that followed behind the army, eager to leap forward.
<br><br>"My little yellow sky, it's time to practice."
<br><br>"But pull back!" Li Jin said, "Those little yellow cows you just cultivated, I'm afraid that they will not be extinguished by the world after one move."
<br><br>"Why not let me on, an empty-handed white blade, directly take it!"
<br><br>"Brothers and sisters ......" next to Wu Tian apprehensively and whispered openly, "these two guys beat me many times, I hate itching hands, how about not letting me go on?"
<br><br>"No, let me blow them both up!" As soon as Wu Tian's words fell, he heard Hong Crazy loudly stop, "If you guys don't let me on, I'll blow myself up right now!"
<br><br>"......" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The corners of the mouths of the disciples twitched as they heard the words.
<br><br>All of this was heard clearly by the World Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch standing on the city tower.
<br><br>The two were so angry that they clenched their teeth.
<br><br>To actually treat them as prey, it was simply unbearable.
<br><br>"I will let them know why the flowers are so red today!" The Genting kingdom ruler said indignantly, "Especially that brat who threatened to blow us up!!!"
<br><br>After speaking, he flew up and struck towards the city with a palm strike!
<br><br>Exterminator followed suit.
<br><br>Before the two arrived, that Hong madness had already rushed towards the two.
<br><br>"This fool, he dares to rush straight over?" The Genting Kingdom Monarch disdainfully said, "Heh, looking for death!"
<br><br>The next moment, an earth-shattering boom came, the two people simply did not have time to react, fire and smoke instantly swept the two people.
<br><br>The two people who were blown away had their limbs and arms fall back to the city tower.
<br><br>The Genting king was directly blown off an arm, fainting to death.
<br><br>And extinction is even more, directly blown into meat slag.
<br><br>The two eyes rolled around, and the lips were blown up and stuck to the eaves of the wall on the city tower.
<br><br>That eye rolled, the lips stuck to the wall opened and closed, "Quick, close the city gate!"
<br><br>"Yes!" The people below hurriedly had to close the door and retreated.
<br><br>"Stupid! Bring my meat scraps with you!"
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Inside the Genting Great Hall, the Genting kingdom ruler woke up leisurely.
<br><br>A mass of rotten flesh slowly squirmed in the center of the hall, and a dense gas lingered on the rotten flesh.
<br><br>Rotten flesh slowly closed together, a human figure gradually into.
<br><br>Outside, there was the earth-shattering sound of shouting and banging on the door.
<br><br>"Both of us have temporarily lost our fighting power, and their morale is in full swing, how can this be?" The Genting kingdom ruler said with a gloomy face while regrouping his severed limbs.
<br><br>Perdition slowly stood up from the ground, his face was bloodless, "Don't be impatient for a moment."
<br><br>"Isn't that the person behind the curtain still in our hands?" He said, "As long as they are still in our hands, even if they crash through the city gates, they won't dare to make a rash move."
<br><br>At these words, the ruler of the Genting Kingdom nodded, "That's right." Only his face was still filled with anger.
<br><br>Outside, there was a sudden loud sound that rushed to the sky. It was the sound of the city gate breaking.
<br><br>As they were talking, someone from below hurriedly came, "Report!!!"
<br><br>"Report what hold! The city gate is broken? I still need you to report?
<br><br>"Can't even defend one city gate, trash!" The angry Genting king lifted his foot and was about to kick the man away, but was grabbed by the leg with a quick eye and hand by Perdition.
<br><br>"Say." Perisher turned his head to the subordinate and said.
<br><br>The subordinate touched the cold sweat on his head, "Back to Your Majesty, the boundary of the Ancient Killing Formation has been broken, and four of them have disappeared!"
<br><br>The Genting king retracted his legs, picked up the subordinate's collar and roared, "What?! People have escaped? What about the seven women guarding the formation?"
<br><br>"Your Majesty, they have disappeared together." The subordinate said, carefully covering his neck, "It looks like, also defected to the enemy ......"
<br><br>As soon as the words fell, the angered Cloud Top kingdom ruler slapped the person to death with one palm.
<br><br>And then, also covered his own heart, backed up repeatedly.
<br><br>The gruff-faced Exterminator held the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch upright, "I remember you didn't say you had a lot of precious materials and extreme treasures inside your treasury?"
<br><br>"We have to hurry up and recover now, first go to the treasury to get a few top-grade immortal pills to recover, and still have a chance to fight with one!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!" The Genting kingdom ruler responded and was about to greet his subordinates, "Someone!"
<br><br>"Report!!!"
<br><br>This voice made the Genting ruler's eyes roll over and almost roll over.
<br><br>Fortunately, the world of extinction held him.
<br><br>"No harm, it's just a broken city or something, don't panic."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, that makes sense." Genting kingdom monarch slowed over, "Say, what's wrong."
<br><br>"We our our treasury boundaries are broken too! Others looted it ......," the subordinate spoke with trepidation, while not moving to cover his chest.
<br><br>At these words, the king of Yun Ding spat out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>He drew out the knife on the shelf next to him and slashed the neck of the subordinate.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler and the exterminator stood in front of the messy treasury.
<br><br>Both were red-eyed.
<br><br>"These fools, they took all the gold coins ......" said the Genting king in a trembling voice, "but not a single immortal treasure."
<br><br>"But it's all ruined." Perdition clenched his fist, his anger spread out from his body.
<br><br>"Report!!!"
<br><br>Destruction turned around and smashed the man into powder.
<br><br>"I don't want to hear it."
<br><br>"The city is broken, and our imperial city boundary is broken." The Genting kingdom ruler looked at the distance, his whole body was bloodless, "What are we going to do down there?"
<br><br>Perdition took out the Immortal Pillar and looked at the Qi that had completely disappeared inside. His face was extremely ugly.
<br><br>Before the two could discuss a specific solution, the army had already rushed over to kill.
<br><br>The two were quickly surrounded by the dozens of people leading the way.
<br><br>The two stood in place at a loss for words.
<br><br>"Aren't you guys very powerful?" Wu Tian stood in front and said loudly in mockery, "Why aren't you arrogant anymore?"
<br><br>Behind him, dozens of brothers and sisters held their bladders and watched in good humor. Looking at the two people in front of them as if looking at two dead people.
<br><br>"What to do what to do?" The Genting king was scared silly and covered his arm which had not fully recovered.
<br><br>At this point, both of them were unwilling to admit that they could not handle the scene at this point, yet they had to admit it.
<br><br>Just as the two were losing their minds, the sky suddenly turned dark.
<br><br>A huge black vortex appeared in the sky, and the wind rose for a while.
<br><br>Dozens of disciples could not help but reach out to block their faces.
<br><br>The two people who were just overwhelmed by the thought of extinction were overjoyed. They looked at the figure that appeared in the black vortex and shouted happily, "The messenger, it's the messenger!!!"
<br><br>After saying that, both of them flew up and hid behind the messenger that appeared in the black vortex.
<br><br>The Genting king stretched out his arm and pointed at the dozens of people below, "Aren't you guys so awesome? I'm telling you, right this moment, you're all dead!"
<br><br>He waved his arm and laughed loudly with his palm.
