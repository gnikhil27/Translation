But Desolate Pathless saw through the black-clothed guard's thoughts at a glance.
<br><br>In a deep voice, he said, "You'd better not reveal your cultivation in front of him, and even less so, I want to keep him with me."
<br><br>"Your Holiness, why?"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard was puzzled: "Even if you find this mortal interesting and want him to follow your side, Your Holiness, there is absolutely no need for you to hide your identity!"
<br><br>"Because as long as he knows your identity, he will beg himself to follow you, and when you want him to do something, he will do it obediently?"
<br><br>"What, you still learn to argue with me?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless sank his brows and said angrily.
<br><br>"My subordinate does not dare."
<br><br>The black-clothed guard hastily bowed his head and said, "It's just that I can't see that mortal treating you disrespectfully, who are you, Your Majesty, and who is he?
<br><br>"What do you know?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless lectured in a deep voice: "What I value is his feeling of being in contact with me like this." Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Lastly, you are warned once more, not to reveal my identity, and even more not to reveal my cultivation in front of him, because although this little brother has a good heart, but he mortal is after all mortal, what if it scares him?"
<br><br>"This daddy does not want to easily meet an interesting person and become obsequious in front of me."
<br><br>"Okay, fine!"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard respectfully lowered his head, not daring to argue in.
<br><br>"Haha, old brother has waited for a long time."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had finished serving food to the dog, reentered the wine table and said apologetically.
<br><br>"You are welcome, old brother." Desolate Wu Dao laughed, "By the way, old brother, do you have something to do over here this time?"
<br><br>"Nothing to do, because it's the first time I came to Nansha, so I want to walk around and see the scenery, just think of it as a spring trip!" Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji's eyes lit up and said, "So old brother is like me, why don't we travel together, and it just so happens that I know there are quite a few fun places nearby, I can show you around."
<br><br>"That would be really great."
<br><br>Yi Feng was also full of joy.
<br><br>Originally he was a foreigner in Nansha is like a headless fly, now there is a person to lead him, simply can not wait for ah!
<br><br>After having enough wine and food, the group finally went down to the restaurant.
<br><br>The doorway.
<br><br>Yi Feng's carriage was parked there.
<br><br>Beside the carriage, Bone Ben Wei and Dog were waiting.
<br><br>"This one is?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless looked at Bone Ben Wei and passed out a puzzled voice.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and said with a flash of inspiration, "Like old brother, this is also the escort I brought along with me, after all, Nansha is far away, it's always safer to have someone to follow."
<br><br>The reason for this, Yi Feng is also afraid that this skeleton frame to scare others.
<br><br>When he thought of Desolate Wuji also brought such a black-clothed escort, he said so.
<br><br>"Oh, so it's like that!"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing nodded, because this black-robed man, like Yi Feng, was also a mortal without any cultivation, so the guard was just an escort, it was not necessary for him to put any effort into it.
<br><br>It is the dog next to him that makes him a bit strange.
<br><br>But look half a day, but also did not see a reason, so also withdrew his gaze.
<br><br>However, the black-clothed guards behind him heard Yi Feng's words, but revealed a disdainful look.
<br><br>The same as your Majesty with an escort?
<br><br>Hmph!
<br><br>Can this be compared?
<br><br>First of all, let's not mention what kind of person is your majesty, what kind of person are you, but from the guard, that short thing is also worthy of being called a guard?
<br><br>The thing is to pretend, and wear a mask, but really think that you wear a black can be compared with him?
<br><br>However, these thoughts he only dared to bury in his heart, did not dare to reveal it in front of Desolation Trail ground.
<br><br>Followed the deserted path, a group of people directly to the riverside.
<br><br>The scenery here is indeed beautiful, the river breeze, clear and cool, the banks are full of peach blossoms, paving the road with stone slabs, three or two little girls walking by.
<br><br>And the river is also floating large and small boats, there are good people in the pair, there are small two in the play ......
<br><br>"What a beautiful scenery ah!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Yi Feng was in a good mood.
<br><br>"How about it, is old brother satisfied?" Desolate Wu Dao laughed.
<br><br>"Satisfied satisfied."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly said, "Thanks a lot, old brother."
<br><br>"Let's go, let's take a boat and have some fun on the river."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing smiled, and then led Yi Feng towards the shore.
<br><br>There were quite a few small boats docked on the shore, which was similar to some of the attractions in Yi Feng's previous life, which could be rented by just giving a certain amount of gold coins.
<br><br>But this kind of boat are very small, generally can only sit two or three people.
<br><br>In desperation, Yi Feng and his group rented two boats.
<br><br>Yi Feng, Desolate Trailless took the dog on the first boat, while the remaining two guards took the other boat.
<br><br>The two boats slowly floated up towards the center of the river, and the view from the river was even more pleasant.
<br><br>But the black-clothed guard looked at the skeleton Ben Wei sitting opposite him, was full of reluctance.
<br><br>What is his status?
<br><br>He has a high status, why should he let this kind of lowly mortal sit in the same boat with him?
<br><br>And also stand there without speaking?
<br><br>Pretending to be profound?
<br><br>He was very uncomfortable with this look of Bone Ben Wei, causing him to want to reveal his cultivation aura and scare this dwarf to the ground.
<br><br>However, forced by the order of Desolate Pathless, he did not dare to do so.
<br><br>However ......
<br><br>His gaze was slightly raised.
<br><br>This did not prevent him from catching this dwarf with other means.
