Under the expectation of the palace crowd waiting.
<br><br>The Qi Luck Immortal Pillar emitted powerful fluctuations, a circle, like a ripple spread out.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Celestial, astrological, dao and other kinds of bizarre power began to diffuse in the surrounding.
<br><br>After the final foreshadowing lasted for a moment, finally the chaotic color within the Qi Yun Immortal Pillar was like a water wave, a violent ripple.
<br><br>"It's moving."
<br><br>Extinction and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch's heart and soul astonished, staring at this scene with wide eyes dead.
<br><br>Under the excitement, their hearts were even raised to their throats.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>While their butts were clenched under their close attention, the Qi Immortal Pillar lowered by a third with a swish after the swish.
<br><br>"Thump!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>This swish almost caused the eyes of the Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch to stomp right off.
<br><br>The stomach of their legs trembled straight, almost not letting the two of them directly jerk over.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>Both of them spoke in unison and shouted out.
<br><br>The faces, too, quickly turned black from the original expectation until they turned purple.
<br><br>The other experts in the courtroom were similarly stunned by this scene, with different expressions of horror.
<br><br>The only one who expected the answer, the two generals of wind and clouds, was a bitter face.
<br><br>Before the two people could react, two powerful forces came and forced directly at the two people.
<br><br>"Say, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>"Is there something else that you are hiding from us?"
<br><br>Extinction and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch grabbed one with one hand, red eyes, almost roaring out.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>How difficult it was to gather this power of qi.
<br><br>Even if his Cloud Top Empire was invincible in the entire Immortal River Continent as well as the Lingxu Realm, it had only gathered two-thirds of its Qi luck.
<br><br>This instantly reduced by one third, the two simply want to vomit blood.
<br><br>"The king of the country, Lord Perdition, where do we dare to conceal from you ah, said we pressed before the words are not finished ah!" The two were carried in the hands, trembling and trembling, said.
<br><br>"Then why didn't you finish your words?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler slapped the wind general to the ground and said viciously.
<br><br>"Yes, why don't you guys finish, you can't even let out a fart, what's the use of having you?"
<br><br>Exterminator likewise slapped the cloud general to the ground and drank with killing intent.
<br><br>Wind and cloud two generals want to cry, hardened their heads to explain: "king, Lord Destruction, it is not that we do not say, is that you two do not give us the opportunity to say ah, we just say half and then you interrupt, just say half and then you interrupt, we also want to finish in one breath ah ah ......"
<br><br>"Shut up, let you say this?"
<br><br>Genting kingdom ruler again a slap on the wind general's head, said morosely.
<br><br>"That is, ask you guys this, hurry up and give us the word, what is going on?"
<br><br>Extinguisher gasped and answered the voice.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, we say."
<br><br>Wind and cloud two generals kneeling on the ground, full of aggression, stammered: "After Huang Tian himself ran out from inside the seal, then came two more people."
<br><br>"Those two people are a pair of young men and women, can not see clearly the strength, condescending, and then not so long, Huang Tian kneeled down to worship two people as the Lord!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The yellow sky worshiped someone as the Lord?"
<br><br>Extinction and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch stared in disbelief, his expression full of incredulity.
<br><br>Never thought in a million years.
<br><br>Huang Tian had actually worshipped a human as his master.
<br><br>They also finally understood why the Immortal Pillar of Qi had descended like this.
<br><br>Originally, the Lord had once had an origin with the Yellow Sky, so after the Yellow Sky came out, it was basically for their use.
<br><br>Therefore after unsealing the yellow sky, the source of qi luck was also this reason.
<br><br>The change is out.
<br><br>The Yellow Sky recognized someone else as its master!
<br><br>"Damn it, damn it!"
<br><br>The two of them, Destruction and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch, had purple faces and clenched their fists tightly, pinching them to their nails, while turning their gloomy gazes back to the two Wind and Cloud Generals.
<br><br>"Say, what exactly are these two people?"
<br><br>The two men asked word for word.
<br><br>Feng Yun's second general raised his head and cried out, "We don't know!"
<br><br>"Don't know?"
<br><br>"Wastes, two dead wastes, what's the use of having you?"
<br><br>In his anger, the Genting kingdom ruler slapped down at the two, directly slapping them into meat cakes.
<br><br>"Someone, use all the power of the Genting Empire for me to thoroughly investigate Huang Tian's whereabouts, and thoroughly investigate who these two people really are!"
<br><br>"To actually follow in the mouth of this emperor and take food from him, I will make them pay a heavy price!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler bellowed angrily.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>As soon as the Genting Kingdom Monarch's voice fell, countless experts in the courtroom responded.
<br><br>Then major experts and major departments spread out from the Genting Empire.
<br><br>The entire Genting Empire.
<br><br>The wind rose and became a huge whirlpool.
<br><br>And the world is not impervious to the wind.
<br><br>The appearance of such a supreme beast as Huang Tian caused a huge wave among many cultivators, and of course, the one that made people discuss before and after tea was the pair of young men and women who made even Huang Tian willingly worship their masters.
<br><br>"Damn it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was in a hurry, cursed.
<br><br>Out for so long, either super garbage qualifications, or the system is too lazy to detect, an ordinary one is not.
<br><br>It is simply drought death, flooding death.
<br><br>Another look at the next few guys, Yi Feng's mood is even worse.
<br><br>Slowly this snail will not say, at least to start the role.
<br><br>Another few ......
<br><br>A silly dwarf black robe.
<br><br>A bitchy dog.
<br><br>I don't know where to get one, snapping dogs all day long on the centipede.
<br><br>And a dumb dog bear.
<br><br>Usually in Tiandi door familiar with his okay, not familiar with the thought that he is a circus acrobatics.
<br><br>Alas!
<br><br>To find the last disciple as soon as possible, and then quickly cultivate immortality ah.
<br><br>Cultivation of immortality will have the strength to find a wife.
<br><br>Who wants to carry this group of fools all day long ah!
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations host, because your sixth and seventh disciples, have made a name for themselves on the continent, therefore two points of Qi luck value are specially awarded!"
<br><br>Just then, a familiar voice came out from the back of his mind.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Old Six and Seven broke into fame?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised.
<br><br>But who are this Old Six and Old Seven again?
<br><br>After thinking for a long time, Yi Feng did not have much impression, so he did not care anymore.
<br><br>As for the bright hall, Yi Feng also did not care about it at all.
<br><br>With this group of waste disciples, really can not make any big name?
<br><br>Either in a village to ask for food is known to everyone, or and who fought a fight occasionally won a little reputation as a bully.
<br><br>After all, the group of goods waiting for death, can not do anything good.
<br><br>At best, a barrel of a little bit of a skill, go out where to open a restaurant, can be a little bit of a good reputation.
<br><br>But this qi luck value ......
<br><br>It is a little curious to Yi Feng.
<br><br>This is the system has never appeared.
<br><br>What is it for?
