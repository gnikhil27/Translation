"Good, then let's do it, all demon emperors, let's pass down the order, first set up the territorial lines."
<br><br>"And we, then learn a human tactic, capture the thief first, we first join forces to take out those human Martial Emperors before, the rest of the rabble, and finally in a net."
<br><br>"Good idea!"
<br><br>The voice fell at the same time, the demon emperors immediately emitted powerful breath fluctuations, under this fluctuation, the air are set off a whistling sound.
<br><br>Then, transformed into several streams of light, with an invincible momentum, swept out towards the mountains and forests at speed.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, just a short distance ahead, the breath of humans was found."
<br><br>"Good, the two auras are very powerful, they should be human Martial Emperor experts, let's work together to attack directly and try to quickly take our first victory!"
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Voices fell one after another, the aura was stronger than one, and the voices were more confident one after another, simply with conviction.
<br><br>In an instant, the four demon emperors rushed straight towards the place where the aura fluctuated. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The sky.
<br><br>A white-haired man clutching a long sword stood in the air, his cold eyes, sweeping between the mountains and forests.
<br><br>At this moment, he suddenly felt four powerful fluctuations, attacking towards him.
<br><br>His pupils shrank.
<br><br>A harsh gaze, fierce look.
<br><br>With this glance, he directly locked on the four Long Geng Demon Emperors.
<br><br>This glance also directly caused the several great demon emperors to sweat coldly, and a creepy feeling emerged.
<br><br>"It's rash, it's a Martial Sect, withdraw!"
<br><br>The most perceptive of the several demon emperors, Liu Yang demon emperor immediately reacted to this is a martial sect, towards the side of the demon emperor after a reminder, just full of momentum, vowed to take the first victory, he turned and swept the air and ran.
<br><br>The demon emperor of Changgeng and the demon emperor of Forgetting River next to him saw this, also a drop of cold sweat slipped down from his forehead, followed by the demon emperor of Liu Yang turned and ran.
<br><br>However, Yan Raptor Demon Emperor, who has always been good at speed, was still in front, his eyes locked on the white-haired man, not only did he not hear Liu Yang Demon Emperor's words, but he also did not expect that this was a Martial Arts expert in front of him.
<br><br>"Three, this man looks somewhat powerful, but the four of us working together will definitely be able to cut him down."
<br><br>"I'm fast, I'll attack him head-on, and you three will hold the side."
<br><br>"We'll take the victory in this battle for sure!"
<br><br>"I, Yan Capture Demon Emperor, will go first."
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
<br><br>The white haired man's cold gaze, finally is a move.
<br><br>The long sword held in his hand was drawn out and chopped down without any fancy.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yan snatching Demon Emperor's eyes changed, feeling the powerful aura fluctuation, his mouth hurriedly shouted, "All Demon Emperors, this person is a few points more powerful than I thought, quickly follow me to block this sword."
<br><br>However, after his voice fell, there was no half-hearted response.
<br><br>He fiercely looked to the side, but found that the nearby Liu Yang Demon Emperor and others had long disappeared, and he stared in horror.
<br><br>But that sword, at the same time, also cut over.
<br><br>Yan snatched the demon emperor.
<br><br>Suddenly!
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>At this moment, the Liu Yang Demon Emperor and the others were already running a thousand miles away, panting with palpitations, and their bodies had long been drenched with sweat.
<br><br>They never thought that the humans had actually sent a Martial Sect expert.
<br><br>They also did not expect that they would lose a Demon Emperor before they even touched a single hair.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>"Make up your mind!"
<br><br>"Yes! The appearance of the strongest Martial Sect has exceeded the situation that we can control ah."
<br><br>For a while, the three remaining Demon Emperors discussed in an anxious tone, completely devoid of the bravado they had when they had just set out.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, there is no way out, this matter has exceeded the situation that we can control."
<br><br>At this time, Liu Yang demon emperor came out, said with a grave face: "First Bo Gu demon emperor, then Yan snatching demon emperor, this blood feud is already completely can not be erased, the war between the two tribes will definitely start, only can go into the mountain, notify that one!"
<br><br>"Song Ke Demon Emperor?"
<br><br>The mention of that one, a few big demon emperor will shiver.
<br><br>This one, but the entire South Sand Demon Realm king, to know the demon daddy is more powerful than the demon clan existence, in the eyes of this one, they a few small demon emperor is a mole.
<br><br>But things have come to this point, even to face that even more people feel the terror of existence, there is no way.
