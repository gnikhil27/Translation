The crowd was instantly petrified!
<br><br>Especially looking at the hand of Yi Feng torn in half, but also pinched into a ball of rice paper, heartache straight dripping blood!
<br><br>This Qilin painting whose value is comparable to the emperor's goods, if it were to flow out there is no telling how many cultivators would fight for it desperately.
<br><br>However, such a valuable painting was torn into two halves by this one.
<br><br>Destroyed!
<br><br>And he did so only because his stomach was uncomfortable, using it as hand paper.
<br><br>To put it more bluntly, it is to use the divine painting that is comparable to the emperor's product to wipe the buttocks ......
<br><br>This is simply a waste of natural resources!
<br><br>The crowd could not slow down for a long time, and when they reacted, they immediately found that there was a large stack of Xuan paper that was almost as good as the one just now.
<br><br>"I, can we look at it?" Fifth Longkong stammered and said.
<br><br>"I think, it is possible, just now when the high person left, said that we can just take a look." Yun Xian Que said nervously. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, the crowd rushed to the rice paper in a swarm.
<br><br>Picking up one, the painting on it was a pair of landscape paintings.
<br><br>The crowd was immediately attracted into it, as if there is a feeling of being there, and more shocking is that the painting with a powerful mood, just a glance seems to let them gain a lot, if it is hung at home for a long time to speculate, I am afraid that will get unimaginable benefits.
<br><br>Picked up another piece of rice paper, which is again painted with a Xuanwu divine beast.
<br><br>Just a glance.
<br><br>It made them feel the heavy pressure, another divine painting comparable to the Qilin picture!
<br><br>Picked up another one, on it was written four lines of big words.
<br><br>Hold the sun and moon and pick the stars!
<br><br>There is no one like me in this world!
<br><br>My feet are on the sky, breaking the heaven and earth!
<br><br>I am the only one in all the ages!
<br><br>Seeing these four words, the crowd without exception drew a cold breath, as if in the sentence to see the man proud of the world's invincible posture ......
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>Is this a true portrayal of this one?
<br><br>And pick up other Xuan paper, its value is invariably terrifying, sheet is not worse than the previous Qilin figure.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>The people looked at each other's eyes.
<br><br>One by one, they could see the shock in each other's eyes.
<br><br>In this martial hall where there were treasures everywhere, they, who were obviously from a large clan, felt like country bumpkins had entered the city, and their eyes were suddenly opened.
<br><br>And in comparison, what were the treasures that they usually took pride in, inside this martial hall?
<br><br>"Gentlemen, wait a long time."
<br><br>In the midst of the shock, Yi Feng, who had just washed his hands, came smiling, and then under their dumbfounded gaze, picked up another piece of rice paper to wipe his hands.
<br><br>Looking at the wiped rice paper, then by Yi Feng casually thrown into the basket containing garbage, the crowd's heart beating straight.
<br><br>Heart and liver pain.
<br><br>"Sir you this paper?"
<br><br>Book qin painting finally could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Oh, this paper, ah, is the ordinary Xuan paper, before I used to practice calligraphy practice painting, this is not the end of the practice thought directly thrown away waste, just leave the usual toilet with a, or wipe hands wipe the table what! Yi Feng explained with a smile.
<br><br>At these words, the hearts of the crowd a thud.
<br><br>That is to say, this one every time you go to the toilet, plus wipe your hands, you have to use up two of these comparable to the emperor's treasures Xuan paper?
<br><br>What the hell is this?
<br><br>Even if they are ranked in the South Sand a few big sects, its hidden things together is afraid that the value of one or two sheets of rice paper.
<br><br>That is to say, this one time to go to the toilet, to wipe away the bottom of their clan?
<br><br>Kam!
<br><br>Time and time again, the shock made the crowd feel dumbfounded in the head.
<br><br>"Oh, apprentice ah, do you still have spicy strips at home, help me bring a plate up in a dish."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>In a short while, Zhong Qing came up with a small plate of spicy strips.
<br><br>Looking at Zhong Qing, the crowd instantly focused their eyes over.
<br><br>Because when Zhong Qing walked out, they felt that the blood in their bodies became uncirculated, as if this boy's bloodline had a natural suppression of them.
<br><br>At the same time, he also seems to contain a huge energy within his body.
<br><br>This boy although also can not see the specific cultivation, but the actual fear is as terrifying as ah!
<br><br>At least a Martial Saint.
<br><br>Or maybe a Martial Emperor!
<br><br>"I forgot to introduce, my only little disciple, looks tender, but actually is sixteen years old." Yi Feng introduced with a smile.
<br><br>All, sixteen years old!
<br><br>The crowd's eyes fell straight, what the fuck do you mean sixteen years old ah!
<br><br>Sixteen years old on this cultivation, immediately let the fifth long air and their so-called pride of heaven feel full of hot face.
<br><br>They are so powerful at the age of sixteen, they are nothing compared to them!
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>As expected of this one's disciple.
<br><br>"Come, come, eat something, there is no other good things to entertain, this is some homemade snacks, you can try." Yi Feng stretched his hand and smiled.
<br><br>At that, the crowd turned their eyes to the spicy food.
<br><br>Originally wanted to politely decline, after all, they have long ago to eliminate the grain, but remembered that it is this one's invitation, so one person took one to try.
<br><br>However, the spicy strips in the mouth.
<br><br>Everyone's body trembled violently.
<br><br>Obviously, everyone felt the great benefits from within it, as well as the huge energy contained therein.
<br><br>This seemingly mediocre snack actually topped the top grade medicine.
<br><br>The crowd looked dumbfounded.
<br><br>Never thought that the snack that this person took out was so shocking.
<br><br>Everywhere is a treasure!
<br><br>But although the crowd still wanted to try the second one, but did not dare, afraid that Yi Feng blamed them for being greedy for more.
<br><br>Looking at their abnormal look, as well as eating one and not eaten again, Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Picked up a small bite.
<br><br>Sure enough, the taste was really not that good after being left for a long time.
<br><br>"Sorry for the surprise, this thing has been sitting for a bit too long, I'd better hurry up and pour it out." Yi Feng said apologetically, picked up that small dish, whistled in his mouth and shouted, "Wangcai Dogzi, come over here."
<br><br>The dog who was digging a pit heard the words and hurriedly ran over.
<br><br>"Heaven-devouring demon wolf!"
<br><br>"Or a demon dweller?"
<br><br>The crowd was dumbfounded, and the most shocking thing was that the Demon Dignity's Sky Devouring Demon Wolf was actually raised by this one as a dog?
