"Oops, really?"
<br><br>Bone Benevolent asked with excitement at once.
<br><br>"I don't dare to lie to you."
<br><br>The Spirit King carefully kneeled on the ground and said, "The seven of them are now sitting on the edge of the Desolate Realm to cultivate it, and sometimes they will enter the Desolate Realm for a short period of time to exercise, that is, the little one has the heart to do so, so they have never made a move on them."
<br><br>"In short, this is so every day for more than ten years."
<br><br>"All are tender girls, big long legs."
<br><br>The Spirit King's words immediately made Skeleton Ben Wei's deer in the headlights and hehe giggled.
<br><br>"Since your lordship likes it, I'll capture them here?"
<br><br>The Spirit King asked again.
<br><br>"Wait, let me clean up first."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei a pressure palm, emergency lift his tight pants, and bend down to blow his beans shoes, posed a relatively handsome pose asked, "Qing ah, you guys quickly look, brother today's temperament?" The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"En, very perfect, but the details are slightly lacking."
<br><br>The dog nodded seriously, then a look, with the centipede milk agent towards the skeleton Ben Wei surrounded.
<br><br>The dog first rolled Bone Ben Wei's trouser legs twice, and the milk agent stripped the two threads from the clothes.
<br><br>The centipede, on the other hand, became smaller and plopped directly onto the chest of Bone Benway, with its long body rolled into a circle and shrunken together, transforming into a heart-shaped pattern.
<br><br>After primping everything, the dog clapped his paw and drank: "Done, perfect, the world's first handsome."
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei crossed his waist and laughed out loud with satisfaction.
<br><br>Seeing this, the spirit king is also a gaze, also timely thumbs up towards the skeleton Ben Wei, said with emotion: "Lord is really handsome, if I have one ten thousandth of your face and temperament, this life is also satisfied."
<br><br>"Good, I like your kind of honest person!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei gave him an appreciative look.
<br><br>This made the Spirit King smile with his eyebrows.
<br><br>"Wait, my lord, I will immediately catch the sister for you."
<br><br>As the Spirit King's gaze moved, his entire soul body abruptly enlarged and turned into a huge tornado throughout space, sweeping towards the edge of the Desolate Realm.
<br><br>Wherever it passed.
<br><br>Countless dead spirits within the Desolate Realm prostrated on the ground, not even daring to raise their heads.
<br><br>And at this moment the edge of the desolate world.
<br><br>There are seven women sitting on their backs.
<br><br>They have white teeth and red lips, dressed in different clothes, red, blue, green, purple and green everything.
<br><br>Perhaps is born charming body reason, they dress extremely exposed, white skin exposed, hidden, especially the navel and out of the water snake waist, but also with a strong sense of seduction.
<br><br>"The few shut in more than twenty hours, and I do not know how it is." One of the women in red murmured.
<br><br>"It is impossible to say, perhaps still lingering, perhaps long dead in the hands of the dead spirit." Another woman in green said, "After all, usually we seven sisters into which to grind, but also can not last an hour, much less dare to go deeper."
<br><br>"Still don't underestimate the enemy, after all, they are the enemy that even the master has to take seriously." The woman in blue next to the most said, "So don't take it lightly, just observe the movement at all times."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>The woman in red nodded, but remembered something and sighed softly.
<br><br>"Seventh sister why sigh?" The woman in blue asked.
<br><br>"I was thinking, how are we and those few people not the same, restricted freedom can not get out of this cage?" The woman in red frowned and said, "The only difference is that they are inside the Desolate Realm and we are outside the Desolate Realm."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The rest of the women's beautiful eyes also dimmed down.
<br><br>Who doesn't know the pain of this?
<br><br>At this moment, a change suddenly occurred, and from within the Desolate Realm, a violent storm of energy swept towards the direction they were in.
<br><br>"What is this?"
<br><br>The seven women fiercely stood up, their pretty faces shrouded in a dense sense of crisis.
<br><br>"Could it be, could it be that legendary spirit king within this Desolate Realm, that most powerful and mysterious death spirit?" The woman in red said with a glare.
<br><br>"His target seems to be us."
<br><br>"Could it be that he is still able to break the boundary?"
<br><br>But the voice had just fallen.
<br><br>The tornado storm then directly broke the boundary, swept the seven of them in it, and without the slightest resistance, they had swept into the sky, retreating back towards the depths of the Desolate Realm.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>I don't know how long had passed.
<br><br>When the seven sisters woke up, but found the violent power whistling around.
<br><br>"This is, in the Desolate Realm?"
<br><br>"How did we get to the middle of the Desolate Realm."
<br><br>"I remember, it was that Spirit King in the Desolate Realm who made a move on us."
<br><br>The seven sisters woke up, one by one, terrified.
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>An abrupt voice suddenly came.
<br><br>"Aiya, the seven young ladies are awake, quickly, little spirit son, arrange, the atmosphere is created up."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Spirit King answered, and then drank: "Atmosphere group, go."
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, it was seen that countless dead spirits came around towards this side.
<br><br>Then under the horrified gaze of the seven sisters, they braved the ghostly fires on their bodies and moved in a neat, rhythmic flicker, as if the scene had turned into a big stage with bright lights.
<br><br>"Music group, go."
<br><br>The Spirit King let out another loud shout.
<br><br>Countless more dead spirits emerged, mouths emitting a variety of sounds, combined, into a rhythmic, and can not help but dance dance music.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A thunderclap sounded in the sky.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei descended from the sky and made a shining appearance.
<br><br>"Seven ladies, nice to meet you, again Bone Ben Wei."
