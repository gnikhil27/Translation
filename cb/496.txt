Back to Chaos.
<br><br>Perish the world head astrolabe, deduced.
<br><br>Half a day later, Perdition cursed and got up, grossly failing to deduce.
<br><br>"My lord, could this variable be appearing in others?"
<br><br>At this time, the man with the silver fang mask knelt on the ground and said carefully.
<br><br>"What is the meaning of this statement?"
<br><br>Perdition asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"What I mean is, could it be that other people, knowing about your lord's plan, could sabotage it?" The masked man said meaningfully.
<br><br>"Other people?"
<br><br>The pupils of Perdition shrank and asked in a deep voice: "For example?"
<br><br>"Does your lordship still remember that some time ago, a person once appeared in the North Sea, first killing seven of our puppets with the power of a mortal, and then exerting mysterious power to exterminate the White Sun True Palace in the Lingxu Realm using only wooden sculptures?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"And in the Central Continent, the black-robed man who collected the four desolate beasts with his own power and also faced you with a palm?" The masked man guessed.
<br><br>"Impossible."
<br><br>No sooner had the masked man's voice fallen than a rebuttal came from Perdition.
<br><br>"Although these two people are good in strength, and even injured me back then, but at that time I was still in a period of weakness, so the strength of those two people is really only average."
<br><br>"Taking a step back, those two people are not even qualified to come here and enter the pillar of light, so where do they get the ability to influence the big picture?"
<br><br>"To put it bluntly, they don't even have the qualifications to enter my eyes."
<br><br>At those words, the masked man also shut up.
<br><br>As early as a few eras ago, Lord Perdition had deduced that the Immortal River Continent would be at an unprecedented peak in this era.
<br><br>A total of two hundred and thirty-four Heavenly Families who had the qualifications to become Gods would appear in this era.
<br><br>This number is a heaven-determined number.
<br><br>There will not be more.
<br><br>Nor will there be less.
<br><br>In the list of 234 people, these two people are not even in the list, so they are not people of heavenly families at all.
<br><br>How can they influence the big picture when they are not even people of the Heaven's Families?
<br><br>Unless one says.
<br><br>They are already gods.
<br><br>But is this possible ......
<br><br>"Then, my lord, why exactly is this, causing so few people to come at the moment?" The masked man asked.
<br><br>"The astrological projection has no problem, and no hidden problems have been detected to appear, the only possibility is that the time has not yet arrived."
<br><br>Extinction narrowed his eyes and sent out a voice.
<br><br>"Time has not yet arrived?"
<br><br>The masked man's pupils shrank and asked respectfully, "What does Your Excellency mean?"
<br><br>"Among the Heavenly Familiars who have come, except for a small number of people, most of them have awakened within the last two years, and now there is still a year to go before the Immortal River Chaos Monument after all."
<br><br>"So those who didn't come should not have awakened."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The masked man nodded his head with sudden realization.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>The hundred or so people who had come had all awakened in the past two years, and the part that had not come had not yet awakened, which was indeed reasonable.
<br><br>After all, before these two hundred and thirty-four people awakened, they were just ordinary people, and they didn't even know their own background.
<br><br>Therefore before they awakened, they would not be here at all.
<br><br>"So let's just wait and see what happens next!" Extinction tends to be calm in his heart and said indifferently, "Probably every few days, the number of people in the pillar of light will change, and a year later, just about all two hundred and thirty-four people will be gathered."
<br><br>"Then it seems that in that case, our previous worries were superfluous." The masked man said.
<br><br>"It is true that I was overly worried just now."
<br><br>Destruction nodded and said with a clear mind, "Wait quietly, when the time comes, the time will come."
<br><br>In the red divine pillar, Yun Yoyo was sitting here.
<br><br>Next to her, a woman in white was seated. Her hand stroking the long zither, white clothes like snow, with a pure and extraordinary aura.
<br><br>Even Yun Yaoyao had to admit that the woman in front of her was very beautiful.
<br><br>Noticing Yun Yoyao's gaze, the white-clothed woman inclined her head and looked, smiling gently.
<br><br>"Bai Piao Piao."
<br><br>Yun Yoyao also smiled and nodded, saying softly, "Yun Yoyao."
<br><br>The two nodded to each other.
<br><br>Everyone knew by heart that those who could come here were the best, and might even become close friends and partners in the future.
<br><br>After the two greeted each other, Yun Yoyo again inclined her gaze to one side.
<br><br>Among the eighteen red divine pillars, there were seven people.
<br><br>Apart from her and Bai Piaoqiao, there were five others.
<br><br>The five seemed to be together, not knowing what bloodline they were, with dark skin, big and thick, wearing black clothing and black round hats.
<br><br>A simple exchange, Yun Yaoyao learned the names of five people.
<br><br>Five people are five brothers, respectively named burial one, burial two, burial three, burial four, burial five.
<br><br>They came from the Black African tribe in the Lingxu Realm, and the five brothers used the coffin as a weapon, and had always been in unison.
<br><br>But now, the five of them seemed to have an argument.
<br><br>In the midst of the argument, the five tore through space and left the chaos, returning to the Black African tribe from whence they came.
<br><br>After all, this chaos is supposed to come and go freely, plus the red immortal pillar has long recognized them as the master, and not at all afraid of others to take away.
<br><br>"Old Five, the Immortal River Chaos Monument will be opened in a year, what the hell are you doing?"
<br><br>Burial One looked at Burial Five with a gloomy face and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Yes old five, it's just a broken flyer, so what if you find it, now that we have taken possession of the red immortal pillar, sealing the gods into the list is just around the corner."
<br><br>The rest of the brothers were also anxious, also have passed out the voice of advice.
<br><br>Some time ago, the five brothers inexplicably received five leaflets.
<br><br>This leaflet does not know where it came from, but their fifth brother is like a demon, insisted to go to the leaflet on the heaven and earth door to see, persuasion can not persuade.
<br><br>"Four big brothers, what are you talking about, everyone has a flyer, don't you think this flyer is amazing?"
<br><br>"Its vague possession of heavenly energy, and I do not know what material it is made of, you say this Heaven and Earth Gate will be a mundane place?" Burial Five asked out rhetorically.
<br><br>"Indeed, this leaflet is indeed something extraordinary, if it was in the past, we will also go with you, but now the Immortal River Chaos Tablet is about to open, do you have to go again, if the enlightenment of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, is not better than joining what the Holy Land?" Burial One said in a serious tone.
<br><br>"Yes fifth brother, some time ago Lord Exterminator even personally received us, have you forgotten? He said that we have a great status, if we study the Chaos Tablet properly, we will definitely be able to seal the gods and enter the list, how good is this opportunity to achieve fame and fortune?" Burial Two also ruined his mouth to persuade.
<br><br>"Hmph, I think that guy is not a good person anyway, and also exterminate the world, is a good person will be called this name?" Burial five he said in disbelief.
<br><br>"People it's just a name, Lord Perishable has worked hard for the Immortal River Continent, how can you say that about him?" Burial One said with a face full of reproach.
<br><br>"I don't care about this, in any case, there is a power in the underworld urging me to go to this Heaven and Earth Gate, so Heaven and Earth Gate this trip I am determined to go." Burial five face solemnly said: "four brothers, I also advise you, this immortal river chaos monument is really not our path, and that extermination is really not like a good person, it is best that you can go with me to the heaven and earth gate."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Burial One was full of anger and questioned in a deep voice, "Old Five you insist on making our five brothers who are united as one, separate like this?"
<br><br>"Yes, I must go to the Heaven and Earth Gate."
<br><br>Burial Five said in a firm voice, "I hope the four brothers can go with me."
<br><br>"Fine, fine, since you insist on going despite your brotherly feelings, then you can go." Burial One said with a face full of anger, "But it's impossible for you to leave the good Immortal River Chaos Tablet unenlightened and want us to go with you to chase that vain thing."
<br><br>Speaking of this, he raised his palm, his copy of the Heaven and Earth Gate leaflet appeared in his hand, and then struck towards the ten-thousand-foot abyss below his feet.
<br><br>This is a black non-forbidden land, and the rolling lava within it instantly engulfed that leaflet, sealing it deadly within.
<br><br>"In this life, it's impossible!"
<br><br>He added word by word.
<br><br>The act of sealing the flyer also represented Burial One's determination at this moment.
