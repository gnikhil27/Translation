"This is it."
<br><br>One of them stared at the small martial arts hall below and said coldly.
<br><br>"Hm!"
<br><br>The other one nodded his head.
<br><br>Apparently, the two were none other than the Shura Demon Clan and the Voodoo Demon Clan of the Red Sun lineage.
<br><br>"Well?"
<br><br>The Fudao Demon Clan asked.
<br><br>"It seems very unusual!"
<br><br>The Red Sun mark on Shura Demon Clan's forehead flickered slightly as he observed with a sharp gaze.
<br><br>Obviously, since this place had planted Ao Qingcheng here, the two did not take the enemy lightly, much less directly hit the door mindlessly.
<br><br>"Not right!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After some poking around, Xiu Luo said with a change of words, "This martial hall is indeed unusual, no wonder Qingcheng was planted here."
<br><br>At these words, Voodoo Demon Venerable frowned slightly.
<br><br>Hastily following Xiu Luo demon daddy's gaze, he immediately found several unusual auras in the wasteland behind the martial hall.
<br><br>"Three human Martial Sects and a Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>Voodoo Demon Venerable asked with a gruff voice.
<br><br>"Well, that punk Ao Qing is also there."
<br><br>Shura's gaze swept frequently over the three Martial Zongs, as for the youth on the recliner, and a black-robed retard who was catching butterflies, they were directly ignored by the two of them.
<br><br>"What are these Martial Sects and that Martial Emperor doing?"
<br><br>The Voodoo Demon Sect asked again.
<br><br>"I don't know, humans always do some strange things, this is not important, what is important is what should we do now?" The Shura Demon Clan said in a deep voice with a frown.
<br><br>Those two mortals and that Martial Emperor they could simply ignore, but those three Martial Sovereigns they had to treat solemnly.
<br><br>"Although it is three Martial Zong, but from the breath, three are early Martial Zong, while we two are the middle Demon Zong, although two against three, but we realm high not to mention, even the same level of combat we demon beasts on all stronger than humans."
<br><br>Fudo demon clan contemplative analysis.
<br><br>"What's more, we still have semi-saintly treasures, the umbrella to cover the sky!"
<br><br>"So?"
<br><br>"So since we are here, there is no need to make a trip in vain, strike first and kill them directly with the speed of lightning." A voice full of killing intent came directly from the Voodoo Demon Sect.
<br><br>At these words, the Shura Demon Clan also nodded solemnly.
<br><br>A big hand was raised.
<br><br>A big black umbrella was sacrificed, and with the surge of demon power, the big black umbrella came out of his hand and floated into the sky to slowly open.
<br><br>The moment it opened.
<br><br>The majestic black gas spread out in all directions, filling the surrounding area, enveloping the sky.
<br><br>"Draw a prison."
<br><br>"Suppress!"
<br><br>The Shura Demon Sect let out another deep cry.
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, the large black umbrella spun rapidly, the sky seemed to turn into an invisible vortex, and countless transparent pillars of light shone down, centering on the Small Martial Hall, blocking it all.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong, who was hoeing the ground, the palms of the three people suddenly tightened, and fiercely looked towards the sky.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the hearts of the three people were greatly alarmed.
<br><br>While being greatly alarmed, they also discovered the powerful effect brought by that black umbrella, which not only blocked the surrounding, but also suppressed their cultivation.
<br><br>"So it's two demon clans, actually coming to make trouble here sir, I'll let you die!"
<br><br>Chu Mad Lion was instantly furious, and after a light shout, he immediately raised the hoe in his hand and was about to charge towards the two demon clans in the sky.
<br><br>"Steady."
<br><br>However, Wu Yonghong pressed Chu Mad Lion's shoulder.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>Chu Wild Lion's face was anxious, "These two people are obviously here to cause trouble, so it's just as well if they don't strike with me, why are they blocking me?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong shook his head solemnly towards him, then glanced his gaze towards Yi Feng and reminded in a soft voice: "This is Mr.'s territory, these two unopened demonic beasts came to make trouble, do you think with Mr.'s strength, will not know they are coming? But sir did not even move, we a few for sir work can take the liberty to do?"
<br><br>"Wouldn't it be, a clamor to take away the master?"
<br><br>At these words, Chu Mad Lion snapped awake.
<br><br>Looking around, it was true that Mr. was still fiddling with his zither, and even that black-robed henchman of Mr. was indifferent, continuing to grasp the butterfly.
<br><br>Can't help but, he gratefully glanced at Wu Yonghong and put down the hoe in his hand.
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng, while fiddling with his guitar, while thinking about what songs to focus on next, completely unaware of the two figures stepping high in the sky above his head.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>His "zither" proficiency is also a skill, if always play the same style of song, proficiency will improve very slowly, but if you frequently change the type, such as light, sad ...... and so on a series of words, then improve it with half the effort.
<br><br>And just at this time, the two demon clans overhead sneered.
<br><br>"It seems that these three human martial sects, weaker than we thought, our purpose is so obvious, but still do not dare to counterattack." The Shura Demon Sect said disdainfully.
<br><br>"Probably, the cultivation levels have all been suppressed by the Heavenly Covering Umbrella!" The Fudao Demon Clan said.
<br><br>"Then since that's the case, then you guys don't have a chance."
<br><br>Shura Demon Sect coldly laughed, and looked at each other with Voodoo Demon Sect, and renewed their movements.
<br><br>Hand seals were quickly formed.
<br><br>The red sun seal on their foreheads emitted a dazzling light, and also at the same time, a huge energy ball condensed out in front of their bodies.
<br><br>Once the energy ball came out, the violent aura swept, the surrounding space whirred and turned into a vacuum.
<br><br>At the same time, Wu Yonghong three people immediately felt a great pressure, forehead cold sweat can not help but flow down, especially the energy ball, as if hanging above their heads a huge bomb.
<br><br>"Sir how come you are still indifferent?"
<br><br>Finally, Sun Zhuge asked with an ugly face, while wiping a cold sweat.
<br><br>"Yes, if sir still doesn't do anything, these two demon clans will soon make their move."
<br><br>Another worried voice came from Chu Wild Lion.
<br><br>"Be at ease for a moment!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong said comfortingly.
<br><br>But despite those words, sweat was running down his forehead.
<br><br>But without a word from the gentleman, they didn't dare to act without permission, they could only wait.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>In the next moment, two light cries came from the sky, and the two Xiu Luo pushed the energy ball in their hands down at the same time.
<br><br>Once the attack came out.
<br><br>The pressure increased greatly throughout the range.
<br><br>It was like two meteors sliding down from the sky, breaking through the air and falling towards the ground with a heavy breath.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people will stare at Yi Feng dead.
<br><br>Obviously, under such a powerful attack, they were already a bit subdued.
