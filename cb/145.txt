"Well, I still have things to deal with here, you guys go to the back and take a look first, when to start working you guys say it yourself!" Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The three nodded respectfully and gratefully, and scrambled to receive the thing that made them dream, and clutched it tightly in their arms before they walked towards the back of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Seeing these three leave, Yi Feng then looked back at Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>His eyebrows, tightly creased.
<br><br>Although he is usually more generous, but not necessarily he is an honest person, for this kind of look is to cause trouble, he definitely will not easily let go.
<br><br>With Yi Feng's frown, Lu Dasheng suddenly felt an invisible pressure attacked towards him, making him unable to lift half a force.
<br><br>This kind of pressure in his opinion, than the Yi Feng feet of that black-robed man more terrifying, perhaps not so direct, but this kind of pressure is like innate, and like that kind of cross-dimensional suppression!
<br><br>For a moment, he prostrated himself on the ground, not daring to move a muscle.
<br><br>"Say, what exactly are you here for?" Yi Feng said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I, I I I ......" 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Rudasheng face ugly, is stammering, suddenly eyes bright, said in a hurry: "Lord, I also heard others say that your family's land to reclaim, so I also came to ask if you want to do something people."
<br><br>"You are also here to find something to do?" Yi Feng looked at Lu Dasheng and asked half-heartedly.
<br><br>"Yes, I'm really here to find something to do!" When Lu Dasheng saw that Yi Feng seemed to believe his words, it was like he grabbed a straw and said sincerely: "I really came to do something, you must believe it, I like to joke, just now I was only joking with you."
<br><br>Looking at the sincere appearance of Lu Dasheng, Yi Feng also believed a few points.
<br><br>Although this recognition seems a little crazy unreliable, but he did talk to many neighbors about this matter before. And these days the lower class people are not easy to live a life, in order to make a living, hear where there is something to do is not knocked on the scalp to go?
<br><br>What's more, a good proprietor like him?
<br><br>If you think about it, this person and his ordinary life, Yi Feng can not think of what he has with himself, really say that he is here to cause trouble, it does not seem to be justified.
<br><br>"Then since you're here to do something, don't kneel on the ground again." Yi Feng sized him up and said, "But in the future, this kind of joke that raises suspicion, it's best not to make it again."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng say that, Lu Dasheng hurriedly climbed up from the ground, revealing a look of relief.
<br><br>At the same time, remembering the opportunity of those three Martial Sects just now, his eyes flashed and a calculation appeared in his heart, so he hurriedly said, "My Lord, I came in the same haste as those three, and I didn't bring anything on hand, you see?"
<br><br>"I have something here, but as you can see, there are already people who are opening up the land, really say that there is a shortage of work, there is only one particular job left to do, are you sure you can do it?" Yi Feng looked up and down at Rudasheng and said.
<br><br>"Can do, can do, any work can do."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng said hastily, especially when hearing Yi Feng said to give something directly, but also to show the extreme urgency.
<br><br>At the same time in his heart, also flooded with a trace of complacency.
<br><br>Life is really changing, never know what will happen in the next moment, and I Lu Dasheng is worthy of being the number one pill refiner in Nansha, and even also called a strategist!
<br><br>You see, this crisis is not only solved, perhaps even from the hands of this person, to get a good chance ah!
<br><br>It's a sacred product!
<br><br>The two storage rings that he lost are nothing compared to this Saint's treasure!
<br><br>The idea of this, Lu Dasheng simply happy, can not help but shout for their own resourcefulness 666!
<br><br>"Lord, you hurry to tell me, what exactly you plan to arrange me, I can not wait." Rudasheng said with a face full of expectation, in front of the holy treasure, he even forgot how terrifying this one and the one in the corner in front of him really were.
<br><br>"Pick the dung, okay?"
<br><br>Slightly pensive, Yi Feng looked at Lu Dasheng and asked.
<br><br>"Pick, manure?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng, who was just impatient, was dumbfounded when he heard these two words.
