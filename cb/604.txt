The moment Yi Feng grabbed the jade slip, he himself was randomly transported into the trial space.
<br><br>He looked around.
<br><br>It was an arboreal forest.
<br><br>Tall trees shaded the sky, and the forest was cool. The surroundings were quiet, except for a few bird calls, only the sound of the wind and the rustling of the leaves remained.
<br><br>Hey, not bad.
<br><br>It's quiet here, and there doesn't seem to be any fighting.
<br><br>Yi Feng put the jade slip carefully into his pocket and patted his body.
<br><br>Look towards the sound of birds chirping.
<br><br>The birds here, maybe there are also demon pills oh?
<br><br>Yi Feng was ready to hit a few birds to see.
<br><br>The next moment, eight or nine backs appeared in front of himself. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>These people have their backs to Yi Feng, all wearing blue clothes.
<br><br>Between the three peaks, respectively, wearing three colors of clothing to identify.
<br><br>The tsunami night peak, is black.
<br><br>Star Peak, is golden.
<br><br>The sun and moon peak, is blue.
<br><br>One, two, three ...... Yi Feng silently counted, the whole nine!
<br><br>He did not move backward.
<br><br>Come in and meet nine sun and moon peak people!
<br><br>This fucking ...... is not a bit too bad luck ......
<br><br>"Ah, senior brother!" A disciple in front of him pulled another blue-clothed man in surprise, "What a coincidence, senior brother is also here!"
<br><br>"Senior brother!"
<br><br>"Oh my, what a coincidence! It's really God's blessing that all nine of us can teleport together!"
<br><br>"Come on, let's get down to business, let's go find that guy Yi Feng!"
<br><br>"We're definitely not going to make it to the top three, but the master has said that there will be a big reward for killing Yi Feng."
<br><br>Several people laughed and walked forward.
<br><br>Behind the quietly retreating Yi Feng heard this, the legs shake.
<br><br>"Ka-chow ......"
<br><br>A tree branch was broken by his step ......
<br><br>At the same time, all nine people in front turned around.
<br><br>They saw Yi Feng, who was stunned in place.
<br><br>The nine people first froze, and then let out a wild laugh!
<br><br>"Really step through the iron shoes, no place to find, to get here without any effort!"
<br><br>As the words fell, the nine people had already transiently moved around Yi Feng.
<br><br>The nine people surrounded Yi Feng in a group.
<br><br>Anyway, he was discovered. Yi Feng simply stood up straight, and he cleared his throat in a calm manner.
<br><br>"Cough ......"
<br><br>While coughing, he called up his system.
<br><br>Nine people, a bit too many.
<br><br>If the situation is not right, he will slip away first.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng's silent look, a blue-clothed disciple opened his mouth, "What, you wouldn't want to call up the jade slip to escape, would you?"
<br><br>The other eight people next to him laughed out loud.
<br><br>"I thought how powerful it is, this has not even done it, and then want to run!"
<br><br>"It's just like that."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the nine people in front of him who were mocking to the extreme, and thinking about their conversation just now, his face suddenly turned gloomy and vicious.
<br><br>This Guo Shijie was giving himself a certain order to kill.
<br><br>Even if he escaped this time, he would be in danger next time.
<br><br>Even if you can't beat them, there are always a few Earth Immortals you can kill.
<br><br>He simply stood up straight?
<br><br>Coldly look at the nine people in front of him.
<br><br>The head turned and looked this way, and the head turned and looked that way again.
<br><br>"The nine of you are standing too far apart to come." He said slowly, "Don't you want to kill me? Come on, stand together."
<br><br>"All nine of you, together."
<br><br>"Stand together?" One of the disciples spoke, "Do you think we're stupid?"
<br><br>"Five of us were attacked by you when we stood together, and you want us to stand together."
<br><br>"Senior brother, don't talk nonsense with him!" Another disciple said, "Kill it and be done with it."
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was stony.
<br><br>One of the disciples waved his sword in his hand, and a powerful sword qi had come towards him to kill him!
<br><br>Yi Feng was shocked, his body hurriedly dodged, then his finger moved, pointing over at the same time, the man immediately turned into bloody flesh and exploded!
<br><br>"Cut off his hand!"
<br><br>At this time, I don't know who shouted.
<br><br>The eight people next to him did not dare to stop, instantly close, about to cut off Yi Feng's fingers!
<br><br>Obviously, it was better to fight from a distance, but they were instantly close.
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly panic, a time at a loss, see it can not dodge, simply do not hide!
<br><br>Instantly call out the system, panic under the five fingers together!
<br><br>Can kill a few as many as possible!
<br><br>Instantly, five were finger points exploded into bloody flesh.
<br><br>Then Yi Feng was ready to slip!
<br><br>I did not expect the other three to instantly pull away and fly away!
<br><br>So Yi Feng also stopped slipping away.
<br><br>The other three saw that the situation was not right.
<br><br>"How horrible!!!" One of the blue-clothed disciples looked at Yi Feng in horror and shouted.
<br><br>"Run!!!" The other two disciples also shouted.
<br><br>Turning around, they were about to run.
<br><br>"Swoosh!" Two breaths passed through their bodies and they were instantly turned into a pile of rotten flesh.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the pile of rotten flesh in front of him and calmly turned the system back.
<br><br>He thought these than how powerful.
<br><br>In a flash, there was one blue-clothed disciple left.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him, held up his finger and shook it. "You run, why don't you run?"
<br><br>"Senior Brother Yi spare my life!" With a poof, that disciple knelt down in front of Yi Feng. He cried bitterly and was terrified, "Please spare my life, senior brother Yi!!!"
<br><br>"Who the hell is your senior brother?!" Yi Feng lifted his foot and kicked him in the heart, knocking the man to the ground.
<br><br>Instantly the pain in all limbs and bones was so severe that the entire internal organs felt like they were being churned up!
<br><br>That disciple howled and began to squirm on the ground. The face was hideous.
<br><br>"Aren't you going to kill me?" Yi Feng squatted down and used his fingers to break the man's head up, "You do kill instead!"
<br><br>Even though his limbs and bones were in severe pain, the moment Yi Feng's finger touched his head, the man subconsciously shivered.
<br><br>At this moment, his fear of Yi Feng's finger was already deep in his heart.
<br><br>"Really nasty waste, a kick into this than like, and still want to kill me." Yi Feng said disgustedly, he stood up.
<br><br>"It's not me who wants to kill, it's the peak master, it's the peak master," the disciple said slowly, gritting his teeth and enduring the pain, "it's the peak master who wants to kill you! He gave a kill order to all the disciples of Sun Moon Peak ......"
<br><br>"Please, senior brother Yi, spare me ......" said that disciple.
<br><br>Yi Feng was unmoved.
<br><br>He turned his head and looked at the puddles of blood and flesh around him.
<br><br>Thinking of something, he turned back to the last blue-clothed disciple who only had one breath left.
<br><br>"One last question, what realm are you all in?"
<br><br>"I am an Earth Immortal, they are all ......" the disciple's words to this point, his neck was snapped by Yi Feng.
<br><br>The last two words, "Golden Immortal" to death did not say.
<br><br>"For the sake of your begging for mercy, leave you a whole body." Yi Feng took out a handkerchief and wiped his hands accidentally stained with blood.
<br><br>A face of disgust, "All Earth Immortals, all dare to make a move on Laozi."
<br><br>"Damn it."
<br><br>He cursed in a small voice, "How dare you give a mandatory kill order to Laozi!"
<br><br>With that, killing intent surfaced on Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>He slowly stood up and his gaze was gloomy, "Didn't you want to kill me."
<br><br>"Then I'll just kill all your Earth Immortal and below disciples."
<br><br>"See one, kill one." With a deep voice, he slowly spoke.
<br><br>At the same time, the crowd outside the Sun Moon Sect shrieked.
<br><br>Among them, Sun Moon Peak was the most noisy.
<br><br>"What's going on! How come the names and jade slips of nine people suddenly disappeared!!!" The Sun Moon Peak elders were anxious as if their hearts were burning.
<br><br>One had to know that there were only two possibilities for the jade slips and names on the void curtain to disappear.
<br><br>Either crushed jade slips passed out.
<br><br>Either that, dead inside!
<br><br>Standing in front of the crowd, Bai Jing was also scared.
<br><br>This nine people, but eight of them are the second echelon of Golden Immortals!
<br><br>There is no possibility of fighting for the top three, but the top ten is a glimmer of hope!
<br><br>If the peak master came out to know, he would certainly be punished ......
<br><br>"How can, how can?!!!" Hundred Jing was frightened and backed up, "Eight Golden Immortals, ah, how could it be gone?"
<br><br>"Hundred elders take it easy for a moment." Another elder quickly accepted the matter.
<br><br>Stepped forward and comforted, "These eight Golden Immortals probably went in and encountered extremely powerful demonic beasts, and it was too late to escape out."
<br><br>"But we have more powerful Golden Immortals in the second echelon, as well as the three great geniuses, so we can definitely achieve good results."
<br><br>Bai Jing smiled, and also slowed down.
<br><br>Yes, it was only eight Golden Immortals.
<br><br>As long as the disciples achieve good results, the peak master won't blame himself for coming out.
