"Enlighten the king, enlighten Lord Perdition, the target will arrive at the sealing place immediately."
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>A subordinate came to report.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the faces of the people in the palace all lit up.
<br><br>"Pass the order down, order the two generals of Feng Yun to pay close attention!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler hurriedly ordered.
<br><br>Originally, this kind of ultimate moment, he and Extinction needed to be there to witness it with their own eyes would be best.
<br><br>It was just that the two were powerful and represented the Lord of the Tongtian behind them, so once they got close, they would inevitably be tainted with karma.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>Genting king deliberately dispatched the lower cultivation of the wind and cloud two generals to go, so that the cause and effect to a minimum.
<br><br>The good thing is. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>They couldn't witness the scene, but they were able to witness the climbing of the Qi Yun Immortal Pillar here.
<br><br>Thus.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch and the Exterminator looked at each other and sat down directly around the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>Their hearts were eagerly waiting.
<br><br>In the midst of the mountain arête.
<br><br>Two figures were closely watching the barren land in the distance.
<br><br>It was the two generals of wind and clouds that had been deployed by the king of the Cloud Top Kingdom.
<br><br>"The king has specially explained that it must not be too close, so this position is just right, and just enough to see." The wind general said leisurely.
<br><br>After all, their purpose here is only to play the role of observation, will not interfere with any of these things.
<br><br>Once involved in it.
<br><br>Two people tainted with karma not to mention, the back of the world of extermination and the king of the cloud top will suffer implication.
<br><br>"En, this position is indeed good, count the time, should be soon, right?" The cloud general said.
<br><br>"Indeed it should be this moment."
<br><br>The second general of Feng Yun's pupils tightened, looking into the distance and concentrating fully.
<br><br>"It's coming."
<br><br>Finally, Yun General's voice mentioned.
<br><br>Hearing that, Wind General was also busy to look over.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>At the edge of the barren land in the distance, a white-robed figure slowly came.
<br><br>He was originally a Golden Immortal, and should have stepped through the air, not to rush on foot.
<br><br>Only in the plan, almost to the barren land, this person because of obsessed with the ground scenery, which walked all the way through.
<br><br>After traveling to the barren sealed land, he felt the fluctuation of the formation seal here, thus thinking that there is a secret place here, he unsealed the yellow sky seal.
<br><br>Things have developed to this point.
<br><br>Everything is going according to plan.
<br><br>The next stage should be this person to feel the formation fluctuations.
<br><br>Feng Yun II will be two people staring at dead.
<br><br>Only to see that this person has walked into the barren land, a mile deep.
<br><br>The whole desolate place is two miles round, that is to say, he has come to the right center of the desolate place.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>Out of the wind and cloud two will be expected, the target traveled to this place, still did not feel the formation fluctuations.
<br><br>"Something has changed?" Wind General could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Don't be anxious, it's only halfway?" The cloud general hurriedly comforted.
<br><br>Wind General also hurriedly nodded his head.
<br><br>In this kind of tense moment, the two were completely in a mood of apprehension holding their breath, waiting for the next moment to seal the deal.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Under the witness of the two Wind and Cloud Generals, the white-robed man stopped, and his sharp gaze looked around.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The two generals of Feng Yun immediately revealed a look of surprise.
<br><br>Sure enough, the planning of the supreme kingdom lord and the extermination lord could not go wrong.
<br><br>Looking at this, this person in white should have discovered the formation fluctuation.
<br><br>The next step to take is to unravel the formation, right!
<br><br>The two people continued to look expectantly.
<br><br>Only to see the white-robed man still observing the surrounding space.
<br><br>"This place, it seems that there was a very powerful formation before, within the formation, it could be a secret realm, or it could be an immortal cave?"
<br><br>He frowned slightly, his eyes showing a thoughtful look.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>He sensed something else and sighed, "But this formation seems to have been broken."
<br><br>"Since it's broken, even if it's really a secret realm or an immortal's cave, what's left behind will just be leftovers."
<br><br>"Indeed."
<br><br>"There are good and bad things in this world, and after the beautiful scenery, there are desolation and scraps."
<br><br>He seemed to be disappointed with the barren place he had just passed through, and had no more love for this place. With a light sweep of his white robe, he flew up into the sky, and then disappeared as a stream of light.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>The two generals of the wind and clouds who were full of expectation saw this, and all of a sudden they were confused in place.
<br><br>A dry duck-like cry came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Fly ......
<br><br>Fly away?
<br><br>What is going on?
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>Isn't it supposed to start breaking the seal, so how come it just flew away?
<br><br>This is not scientific ah.
<br><br>This is completely out of the ordinary ah.
<br><br>Why is he flying away?
<br><br>Why not break the seal?
<br><br>For a time, the two wind and cloud shivered, staring at the small eyes, hands and feet do not know how to place, but also do not know what to do next!
<br><br>Such as how can not figure out why this person flew away for no reason.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Just at this time, the barren land boomed a boom.
<br><br>The sky and the earth changed color.
<br><br>The sky shook and the earth moved, and the dust was noisy.
<br><br>Beneath the cracking of the earth, a hundred feet tall lava beast, crawled out from inside the ground.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>"Huang Tian?"
<br><br>The two Wind and Cloud generals were once again dumbfounded at this moment, it was simply one wave before another, straight feeling that their brains were not enough.
<br><br>First, the target person did not follow the routine and flew away.
<br><br>I thought a change had occurred and the Yellow Sky Behemoth could not be released.
<br><br>But now, the yellow sky beast climbed out again?
<br><br>What kind of ghost is this?
<br><br>Chaos, chaos, chaos, complete chaos!
<br><br>For a time, the wind and clouds two general cold sweat, has been completely in chaos.
