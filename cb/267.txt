Why is she here?
<br><br>And so miserable?
<br><br>"It's you guys?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Yang Tianyu and the others.
<br><br>"Sir, there is no need to be polite, this woman has repeatedly offended you, we naturally have to take her down to be disposed of by you." The people said in a hurry.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart was shocked.
<br><br>Touched ah!
<br><br>Really fucking touched ah!
<br><br>These fans, it is too spot on, actually even Peng Ying to him!
<br><br>And these people also have some ability ah, not only know the grudge between him and Peng Ying, but also took care of Peng Ying, a cultivator. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But thinking back is also, can engage in the arts, the family situation is certainly not bad, especially they are local people in Nansha, a little power is also a common sense.
<br><br>But Yi Feng also finally experienced a handful of the pain of those stars in the previous life.
<br><br>That is a little what they will be picked clean, their own situation is not so?
<br><br>"Yi Feng, I beg you, please, please give me a chance, I know I'm wrong."
<br><br>"Please, let me be with you again, OK."
<br><br>"I'll serve you, I'll serve you well."
<br><br>At this moment, Peng Xian'er hugged Yi Feng's paws and begged hysterically.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng did not half believe her evil, and kicked her away.
<br><br>He wants to kill me, but also with me, but a few calf bullshit it!
<br><br>But Peng Xian'er crawled over again, crying and begging: "I really know I'm wrong, I serve you well still can not, you used to love to be with me, do you do not want me?"
<br><br>I pooh!
<br><br>As soon as I heard this Yi Feng felt disgusted.
<br><br>Originally people have their own will, you have your choice, Yi Feng can understand, the big deal is to go their own way.
<br><br>But this dead woman all the way to find their own how much trouble?
<br><br>Previously did not feel, now it seems to be a green tea, the heart of the thief also deep.
<br><br>This woman, can not stay.
<br><br>A ruthless heart, Yi Feng a knife stabbed in her chest.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er stared at Yi Feng, fell to the ground with strong unwillingness.
<br><br>And finished off Peng Xian'er, Yi Feng heart more or less some emotions. This is a childhood friend, to this point, but also really hard to predict the world.
<br><br>Looking back at the crowd, Yi Feng arched his hand and said, "Gentlemen, thank you very much, if you need any help in the future, just ask."
<br><br>"Sir, you're welcome, it's all right to serve you."
<br><br>The hearts of the people were excited to the extreme, catching a small Peng Xian'er to get such a word from Yi Feng was so worth it.
<br><br>With a line of people surrounding him, Yi Feng then rushed towards the town.
<br><br>Heavenly Sword Mountain.
<br><br>At this moment, it had become a ruin, and Duan Qingfeng was kneeling in front of Ye Tian Sheng, reporting the ins and outs of it all.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I get it, I finally get it."
<br><br>But listening to Duan Qingfeng's report, Ye Tian Sheng instead laughed out loud, murmuring with a face full of excitement.
<br><br>Seeing this, Duan Qingfeng and the others had a puzzled look.
<br><br>Tomorrow, the Jian Sect's mountain gate had been destroyed, yet he was still laughing so happily, what exactly was going on.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Looking at the crowd's puzzled gaze, Ye Tian Sheng shook his head and laughed, saying, "Qingfeng ah, I know that the destruction of the mountain gate is very hard for you, and even have resentment towards that high person, but you must not think like that!"
<br><br>"Old ancestor I ......"
<br><br>"He destroyed our mountain gate with his own hands, how can he not have resentment?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng's face was suffocated with uncomfortable.
<br><br>Due to the strength of that high person, although he didn't dare to say anything on the surface and even directly handed Peng Xian'er over, it was simply impossible to say that there was no resentment in his heart.
<br><br>"You ah, really foolish!"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng shook his head and lectured, "Not only can we not have any resentment towards that high person, on the contrary, he is still our Heavenly Sword Sect's benefactor!"
<br><br>"Benefactor?"
<br><br>This time, Duan Qingfeng was even more confused, so he hurriedly asked, "Old ancestor, what is going on?"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng smiled mysteriously, and then told Duan Qingfeng the ins and outs of his previous meeting with Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, I still don't understand, I still hope you can solve the confusion."
<br><br>After listening, Duan Qingfeng still had a lot of unanswered questions and asked the doubts in his heart.
<br><br>"Good, then I will tell you one by one, how profoundly righteous this senior is!"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng sighed with emotion, and then spoke leisurely ......
