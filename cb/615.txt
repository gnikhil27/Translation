<br><br>The three brothers who did not understand the situation, also scared instantly kneeled on the ground.
<br><br>"Brother, what should we do."
<br><br>"They actually took the master's portrait, which means that the master is very close to us."
<br><br>"He, he won't know that we are spending time here, right?"

<br><br>A moment.
<br><br>Only the three brothers Li Tian were left in the room.
<br><br>"Click click click click click ......"
<br><br>At this moment, the three brothers, cowering in the corner trembling, the upper and lower teeth are involuntarily colliding.

<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>A mysterious force swept over the three, and the three were dizzy.
<br><br>When they opened their eyes again, the three of them were back on top of the mountain peak at the site of the Grand Competition.
<br><br>"Three senior brothers, why are you still here, I've finally found you."
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>A few Sun Moon Peak disciples just happened to find them.
<br><br>"What are you looking for us?" Li Tian asked.
<br><br>"Of course it's the extermination order for that Yi Feng." That disciple said.
<br><br>But just after he finished speaking, he was directly wrung out by Li Tian.
<br><br>"What about killing your whole family."
<br><br>Li Tian cursed and scolded.
<br><br>Thinking back now, it was still a cold sweat.
<br><br>If not for the experience of these few days, who would have known that such a great master was still lurking in their tiny Sun Moon Sect.
<br><br>"Go, first go and exterminate all the disciples of Sun Moon Peak, and give Grand Master Yi as an appetizer!"
