"Finally going back to the martial arts school, and I do not know what that broken barren thin mount is like."
<br><br>"Really worried ah!"
<br><br>Finally sending off Yun Yoyo, Yi Feng leisurely walked towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Long-lost Pingjiang City, ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng walked windy and dusty through the familiar streets.
<br><br>"Master Yi, it's been a long time."
<br><br>At the stall, an old man selling tofu greeted Yi Feng and hung a pile of tofu on his fingertips.
<br><br>"Aigoo old head Li is very polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng put away the tofu with a smile.
<br><br>"Master Yi, come over and play chess."
<br><br>Under the big tree, another old man shouted at Yi Feng. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"No no, come next time, let's go home first."
<br><br>Yi Feng refused with a smile.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi, it's been a long time since you came to our landlord, where did you die."
<br><br>Inside a red building, a few flowery girls waved their handkerchiefs at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Come in a couple of days."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>Then, from time to time, someone carried a piece of fresh meat to him, and from time to time, someone gave him some tea, and in a short while, Yi Feng already had a big bag inside his hand.
<br><br>"It's better to be at home!"
<br><br>"The old folks are still warm."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>Just then, Zhong Qing trotted over from across the street and greeted Yi Feng excitedly.
<br><br>At the same time, he was followed by the cultivating woman who had taken Zhong Qing away, Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>"How come you came back even before me?" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"It's not two months to the well hehehe."
<br><br>Zhong Qing said with a smile, while also not forgetting to hold the dog a jerk.
<br><br>"The promised two months, I brought back, people to you."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi looked at Yi Feng and said.
<br><br>At the same time some surprise in his heart, Yi Feng with a dwarf and a dog, actually really walked back from the hundred thousand mountains.
<br><br>"Mm."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, and without saying too much to this woman, he walked back towards the martial school with Zhong Qing.
<br><br>After Yi Feng and the others left, a figure landed next to Bai Lengxi, it was none other than Dao-robed old man Lin Mo.
<br><br>"Just let him go back?" Old Daoist Lin Mo asked.
<br><br>"Although confirmed that he is a divine body, but what can be done, that kind of thing, still can not be forced? And you also said that it's useless to force it." Bai Lengxi said.
<br><br>"Then what are you going to do next?" Lin Mo Lao Dao asked.
<br><br>"I plan to stay in Pingjiang City, slowly get closer to Zhong Qing step by step, and finally reach that step." Bai Lengxi said.
<br><br>"But this Tie Bean ......"
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao had a worried face.
<br><br>"The days are long, there will always be a way, you have not heard of day to day love?" Bai Lengxi sneered.
<br><br>Yi Feng finally returned to the martial arts school with Zhong Qing and the others.
<br><br>Pushing open the door of the martial arts school, Yi Feng walked in towards the backyard.
<br><br>Tired ah.
<br><br>Missed his recliner.
<br><br>But as soon as he walked in, a scene appeared in front of him, directly shocked Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>A huge snail, squinting eyes, a half-dead look, lying in the yard on the cover of the well sun.
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly broke into a cursing fit.
<br><br>"Slowly slowly, listen to this name to know, really nerve-racking is not what good things."
<br><br>"Broken system, can not play me ah, can not give me a little reliable ah!"
<br><br>After saying that, the exasperated Yi Feng and a kick in his giant shell, cursing: "Die aside, do not lie in the middle of the courtyard in the way!"
<br><br>Seems to have heard Yi Feng's scolding, that snail lazily opened his eyes.
<br><br>"Blueblu ......"
<br><br>A strange strange sound came out of its mouth, and then squirmed and crawled towards a corner.
<br><br>But this does not crawl okay.
<br><br>This crawl, directly let Yi Feng want to die, crawl half a day to fucking crawl half a meter.
<br><br>On this thing, you tell him that it is a ride?
<br><br>Really want to ride up, let alone go elsewhere, just say to the market to buy a vegetable, I'm afraid he has to die of old age on the back of this snail.
<br><br>He is completely found.
<br><br>This broken system is used to trap people.
<br><br>"Kam!"
<br><br>A loud cursing.
<br><br>Yi Feng left with a black face.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Bones Ben Wei hurriedly squatted towards the snail.
<br><br>"Aba Aba ......"
<br><br>"Bru Bru Bru ......"
<br><br>"Abba Abba ......"
<br><br>"Bru Bru Bru ......"
<br><br>"Ahhhh baba ......"
<br><br>"Buburu ......"
<br><br>"Brother, brother, what are you guys stranded here talking about?"
<br><br>The dog was full of confusion, and the centipede stuck its head over.
<br><br>"This is my old buddy!" Skeleton Benevolent exclaimed, "Polite and polite."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Brother, then you are so powerful, so is your old buddy also powerful?"
<br><br>The centipede and the dog immediately looked at Bone Ben Wei in surprise.
<br><br>"That's for sure, this old buddy of mine has a supreme saying that I still remember." Bone Ben Wei said.
<br><br>"What is it brother?"
<br><br>Dog Centipede asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"He said ......"
<br><br>"Although I am very slow, but when I am big enough, a continent is just a matter of me squirming a little ......"
