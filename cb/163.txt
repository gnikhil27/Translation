"There you have it."
<br><br>"Let's do a ten-faced ambush!"
<br><br>Just when Wu Yonghong and others were about to sink their teeth into it, Yi Feng finally slapped his thighs and made a move, although a tune like Ambush from Ten Faces was not suitable for guitar playing, but as long as it could improve the piano skills, what the heck.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng has action, Wu Yonghong and others are finally relieved, the hanging heart is finally put down.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Just when they thought that Yi Feng would make a big show to directly destroy these two demon clans, they found that instead of performing an attack, Yi Feng picked up his strange musical instrument again.
<br><br>"Let's play another whole song for you guys!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>But what Yi Feng said was easy, Wu Yonghong and the few of them were half-hearted, and the heart that had fallen was hanging again.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"Sir how still calm!" First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The three people were terrified.
<br><br>Because this is no matter how to say, is also two demon clan attack, even if Mr. will not put them in the eyes, but also can not let these two demon clan attack it.
<br><br>And this level of attack if really hit down, Mr. may be able to safe and sound, but they are a few but suffered a great disaster.
<br><br>Under the cold sweat, Wu Yonghong and others could not hold back any longer and were about to ask Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Dang!"
<br><br>However, before they could speak, Yi Feng had already plucked the strings of the zither. As the strings moved, the famous tune, Ambush from Ten Faces, was slowly played out.
<br><br>In an instant, a stern and murderous aura came out and filled the entire surrounding air.
<br><br>The whole space, are like shrouded in a battlefield, so that the people in the situation immediately tense up.
<br><br>At the same time, with the fluctuation of the string, an invisible fluctuation lifted out of the air.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, the two huge balls of energy did not even fluctuate one, turned into nothingness, as if they had never appeared!
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the three people who were nervous Wu Yonghong was like a stone pillar stunned in place. Mouth pumping cold air, eyes are about to fall down.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng was even scared to fall into the cesspit, not caring about their own wretched, staring at the miracle of the occurrence.
<br><br>Such a powerful two attacks.
<br><br>Surprisingly.
<br><br>How could they be broken by a single sound note?
<br><br>This is what kind of supreme means, what kind of heavenly cultivation to be able to do this?
<br><br>Look at Yi Feng lying on the recliner that leisurely look, seems like doing a trivial thing!
<br><br>And Xiu Luo and Fu Dao see this scene, the body also out of a cold sweat, fear instantly spread in the heart.
<br><br>Full of incredulity, they looked at the young man on the recliner.
<br><br>This is to understand that the most powerful of this martial school is not the three martial arts sects they saw, but the youth lying on the recliner, looking the most ordinary, the most ordinary.
<br><br>This kind of supreme means, directly made the two lose the heart to fight.
<br><br>Because it was not the same level at all.
<br><br>The two men looked at each other and planned to put away their heavenly umbrellas and leave.
<br><br>However, with the guitar in Yi Feng's hand, another musical note violently spread out, enveloping the two towards Xiu Luo and Fu Dao.
<br><br>The two people stared in awe.
<br><br>Under this energy, the eyes of the two were covered with despair, completely unaware of how to resist.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>The invisible energy penetrated through.
<br><br>The two experts of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan, the two Demon Sect experts, instantly turned into nothingness, as if they had never been here.
<br><br>And the sky.
<br><br>Calm was also restored.
<br><br>Only a large black umbrella without an owner was left, above the high sky, slowly floating down.
<br><br>Seeing this scene.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and the others were already dumbfounded.
<br><br>Although they knew that Mr. was very strong and powerful, they had never felt it so genuinely.
<br><br>Two great demon sect experts!
<br><br>Figures who could almost walk across the South Sand, just like that, lightly, flying into oblivion?
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>Looking at each other's eyes, mouths pumping backwards, all saw absolute shock from each other's eyes!
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder Mr. did not put the attack of those two in his eyes!
<br><br>Now that I think about it, it was a few of them who were too calm and impatient.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Yi Feng a complete ten-sided ambush has been played to completion.
<br><br>Although the guitar is not suitable for playing this kind of tune, but the overall playing out feeling is not bad, Yi Feng is still quite satisfied.
<br><br>He smiled and looked at Wu Yonghong and the others.
<br><br>But found that all of this people were standing dumbfounded, just like demented.
<br><br>Noticing Yi Feng's gaze, Wu Yonghong and other people hurriedly slowed down and praised from the bottom of their hearts: "The might of Mr., let us worship and admire!"
<br><br>"What we saw today, Mr. style, let us open our eyes!"
<br><br>The words of praise came, Yi Feng rather helplessly smiled.
<br><br>A song, but actually blew into this.
<br><br>But also understand, not to mention his system because of the practice out of the high piano skills, just the ten-sided ambush itself this song, is the existence of people shocked.
<br><br>This, is his former home, five thousand years of cultural heritage!
<br><br>"It's no big deal, calm down!"
<br><br>Although Yi Feng was quite proud of himself in his heart, he still modestly waved his hand at them and laughed.
