They clearly saw that the three holy objects that originally emitted fluctuations, disappeared.
<br><br>In their place.
<br><br>It was a rope broken in two, a mortar and pestle with a large part of it gone, and a pair of scissors that had changed shape ......
<br><br>"What ......"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Just now was full of smiles Peng Xian'er suddenly angry blood attack, mouth spitting out a mouthful of blood, all emanating a monstrous anger, almost hysterical shouted out.
<br><br>And the two of them were also dumbfounded by Long Jiankong.
<br><br>Three powerful holy objects, actually destroyed!
<br><br>The scene in front of them simply startled them with shocking waves, and it was like an explosive thunderstorm resounding in their minds.
<br><br>And just now rushed here how urgent excitement, at this moment will have how desperate and dull. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>So hard to defeat the blowing snow mountain village rushed in front, but in exchange for three pieces of holy relics that have been destroyed?
<br><br>"Peng Xian'er, put down the holy relics in front of you."
<br><br>And just as they were stagnant, Fifth Longkong and the others rushed in and launched an attack towards them at the altar in the first place.
<br><br>However, what Fifth Longkong didn't expect was that Peng Xian'er's three actually didn't fight back and really gave way.
<br><br>"It seems that the Heavenly Sword Sect is just like that, good opportunity, two elders, follow me to seize the treasure!" The fifth long air immediately laughed out loud.
<br><br>At these words, the two fifth formations nodded solemnly, and their faces were full of surprise.
<br><br>I thought the holy relics had been taken by the people of the Heavenly Sword Sect, but I didn't expect things to turn around.
<br><br>But just rushed to the altar, the fifth long air a few people also suddenly found a change.
<br><br>Those three holy relics, actually became broken!
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Several people's jaws almost fell off, like ice sculptures stood in place.
<br><br>"Peng Xian'er, what the hell is going on? Why is it like this?" After reacting, Fifth Longkong immediately asked frantic questions towards Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"You ask me, who do I ask?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's voice was ice-cold.
<br><br>At this moment, she was much harder to bear than Fifth Longkong. She thought that the three holy relics were in her pocket, but what she got in exchange for all the effort was three destroyed holy relics.
<br><br>"If you don't ask who you ask, it's obvious that you guys were the first ones to come in." Fifth Longkong growled, obviously he hadn't been able to accept this fact.
<br><br>"You shut up!"
<br><br>She was on the verge of a rampage, and when she saw Fifth Longkong asking such a question, she almost instantly pulled out her long sword and pointed it straight at Fifth Longkong.
<br><br>"I'm afraid of you!"
<br><br>The fifth long air also waved a feather fan, about to attack.
<br><br>"Stop!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the Fifth Formation and Long Jiankong simultaneously stepped out and blocked the two.
<br><br>"There is no point in fighting now, it's better to figure out what is going on as soon as possible!" The fifth formation took a deep breath and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"He's right, there's no point in fighting now."
<br><br>Long Jiankong also nodded similarly.
<br><br>Although the matter in front of them was also hard for them, they understood even more that getting things clear was still the most important.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Fifth Longkong and Peng Xian'er gave each other a cold look before they withdrew their attacks.
<br><br>With that, the two parties walked to the altar at the same time, picked up the three destroyed holy objects and put them in their hands to observe them.
<br><br>Several people looked at each other's eyes, with incredulity in their eyes. Because everyone could see that these three holy relics were destroyed by people with their bare hands.
<br><br>Cool air was drawn backwards from their mouths.
<br><br>What kind of person was it that had such great strength that he was able to destroy the holy objects with his bare hands?
<br><br>And when exactly did he come in?
<br><br>And what was the purpose of destroying the holy relics?
<br><br>A puzzle appeared in the minds of several people, full of mists.
<br><br>"Elder look."
<br><br>At this time, the fifth long sky shouted.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the crowd looked behind the altar and drew another breath of cold air.
<br><br>They clearly remembered that there were originally countless pills and techniques here, but now, they had actually turned into a pile of ashes!
<br><br>Peng Xian'er reluctantly walked over and picked up the unburned remnants of a paper page from the ashes, and when she saw the contents, her eyes widened and she was even struck back a few steps.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Long Jiankong hurriedly picked up the remnants of the page, and his mouth snapped open.
<br><br>"Mrs. Swire Chaos Duel, the Saint Saint Saint Saint ...... Grade Technique, also burned!"
<br><br>His mouth stammered out, then clutched his heart, almost a breath of air did not come, jerked past.
<br><br>Hearing this, the fifth long air also violently grabbed the remnants of the page, when seeing the mutilated record, immediately mad as if cursing out loud.
<br><br>"My mother, who, who is it?"
<br><br>"Which son of a bitch is it?"
<br><br>"Oooh, such a good gong method, how good it is to give me!"
<br><br>Holding that remnant leaf in his arms, Fifth Longkong was so heartbroken that he was about to cry.
<br><br>The faces of all the people were all ugly to the extreme.
<br><br>Not only were the three holy items destroyed, a pile of even possessing holy techniques and pills, were also burned to the ground.
<br><br>Is this a distortion of human nature or moral degradation!
<br><br>They had worked so hard to come and gotten nothing?
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Just at this moment, Peng Xian'er saw something else and immediately uttered a surprised voice.
<br><br>Seeing this, Fifth Longkong reflexively looked over, and immediately saw a special small box inside that corner.
<br><br>The reason why this small box is special is because the other boxes were either broken, or the lid was lifted, or smashed.
<br><br>And the only intact and well-covered, is this small box.
<br><br>And here the holy relics, holy gongfa everywhere, this intact small box is likely to hide such a treasure ah!
<br><br>Almost instantly, Fifth Longkong rushed towards this box.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er also reacted with hindsight, but was finally one step too late for Fifth Longkong.
<br><br>"Tsk, Peng Xian'er, not everything you can be one step faster." Fifth Longkong sneered at Peng Xian'er with a smug face.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er coldly snorted, filled with chagrin, it was obvious that she had discovered it first, but because of a momentary oversight she was one step slower, she was only able to watch as the item was pocketed by Fifth Longkong.
<br><br>"Since that's the case, then I'll laugh at the treasures inside."
<br><br>Fifth Changkong raised the corner of his mouth and gently lifted the lid of the box, while sticking his palm inside.
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er and the others' faces became tense, staring at Fifth Longkong's things with dead eyes, also curious about what was inside.
<br><br>However, Fifth Longkong's face changed slightly.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong squeezed it again, felt something wrong, drew back his palm and sniffed it on his nose, and his face changed violently.
<br><br>"Grass!"
<br><br>"Shit?"
