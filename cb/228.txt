"Wuhu ...... taking off."
<br><br>"Charge!"
<br><br>Just like that, a bone, a dog and a centipede rushed all the way through, with excited yells.
<br><br>The atmosphere was already heavy in the sword-drawn confrontation between the Imperial Sword Sect and the demonic beasts, so their yells were extraordinarily pleasant to the ear.
<br><br>For a while, they attracted all eyes.
<br><br>Especially the direction they rushed, or the center of the confrontation between the two sides.
<br><br>The crowd could not help but wonder in their hearts.
<br><br>Two armies confront such a serious occasion, suddenly rushed to three shouting, they are fools do not know how to live, can not see the current situation?
<br><br>In the sky, the large expressionless face finally opened its eyes.
<br><br>Showed a touch of impatience.
<br><br>Waved his hand to send out a deep voice: "Tiger Demon, you go deal with them." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After saying that, that big face closed its eyes again.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Tiger Devil Zun nodded respectfully, and with a flash of his body, he arrived not far from the three Bone Benevolent.
<br><br>"Stand still."
<br><br>Looking at them from a high position while revealing his aura, he shouted in a deep voice, "Who are you people that dare to be so bold and make such a racket in front of Ancestor Sen?"
<br><br>Tiger Demon Ancestor originally thought that under his Demon Ancestor's aura, a tiny centipede, a Sky Devouring Demon Wolf and a black-robed human would tremble in fear.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>These three seemed to have not heard his words at all and continued to charge this way.
<br><br>"Seek death!"
<br><br>The Tiger Demon Venerable was instantly enraged, and with his killing intent exposed, he was about to strike out to finish off these three unseen things.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that a giant claw suddenly appeared above him and slapped over with a shocking momentum.
<br><br>"What kind of stupid thing, also here to block the way, and force the end!"
<br><br>Accompanied by a contemptuous voice, Ao Qing's giant claw instantly reached the top of Tiger Demon Venerable's head.
<br><br>The Tiger Demon's face changed greatly, before he had time to react, he was slapped to death by this claw, staring at half of his body sunk into the ground.
<br><br>"Dog brother bull batch, dog brother mighty!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Qing head of the night wind centipede at once out of the flattering voice, the whole appearance also became spirited, this fucking is considered to be close to the real thigh ah!
<br><br>"Dare to stop us to get money, really do not open the eyes of things, Qing ah, well done, worthy of the brother's good brother ......"
<br><br>Skull Benevolent also passed out complimentary voice, with yells dragging wide black robe continued to charge forward.
<br><br>And such a scene, look at all the people.
<br><br>Tiger Demon Zun, the best among these Demon Zuns, was actually slapped to death by that Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf in one slap?
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>I thought it was three fools, but I didn't expect that the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf had such strength, which really made them unbelievable.
<br><br>However, this sudden change of events was a good thing for the crowd of the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li Family.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The overall situation was still not optimistic.
<br><br>After all, with Song Ke stopping there, it was a big mountain that was hard to cross.
<br><br>And the death of the Tiger Demonfather also made the big face in the sky, which had just closed its eyes, appear to be moved and cast a condescending gaze down.
<br><br>But however, for these or awe, or angry gaze, brother three completely ignored, eyes only the night wind centipede pointed to the small dirt bag.
<br><br>This small earthbag is located in the middle of the confrontation between the two armies of the Royal Sword Sect and Song Ke.
<br><br>Then under all eyes, the three brothers finally ran to the small earthbag.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Only when they ran closer did they find that the small earthen bag had split in the middle with a huge crack in the ground and was split in two, there was no treasure at all as the Night Wind Centipede had said.
<br><br>"Grass, where is the money?"
<br><br>"Where is the money of the old man?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, just excited Bone Ben Wei suddenly confused, in situ anxiously jumped straight, then a night wind centipede pinch in the hand, angrily asked: "You Ya cheat me?"
<br><br>"Brother brother, do not dare ah, I really do not dare to lie to you ah, before this small earth bag under a small secret room, before I followed the old man will treasure hidden inside ah, you see the traces of this secret room is still there, yes, there are still left behind gold coins?" Night Wind Centipede hurriedly explained.
<br><br>On hearing this, Bone Ben Wei went over and peeled away the dirt to take a look, and indeed, as Night Wind Centipede said, there is a trace of a secret room here, and also picked up a gold coin.
<br><br>This is enough to prove that the night wind centipede really did not lie.
<br><br>But the more this happens, the more uncomfortable Bone Ben Wei is, the handful of ducks flew, how the hell can I stand it, immediately growled and hissed: "In the end which son of a bitch got my gold coins, get out!"
<br><br>"Brother, such a wide range of ground cracks, I'm afraid it's that zombie face in the sky." Ao Qing pointed his claws at Song Ke in the sky and said plainly.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei heard, immediately looked up at the sky Song Ke.
<br><br>"So it's you zombie face who lost my gold coins, hurry up and get down and pay for it!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei stuck his waist and shouted furiously.
<br><br>At these words, the people in the Imperial Sword Sect camp were all shocked, and also immediately wiped their sweat for Bone Ben Wei, who actually dared to point at Song Ke and speak like this.
<br><br>Even though that Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf was strong, I'm afraid it wasn't enough in front of Song Ke!
<br><br>Sure enough, Song Ke's big face gushed with anger, squirming his mouth and emitting a heavy voice.
<br><br>"What are you, how dare you talk to this ancestor like that?"
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>As soon as the questioning voice fell, the might of that big face changed greatly, and at the same time a heavy mighty pressure collapsed towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Under this pressure, the people of the Royal Sword Sect behind Bone Ben Wei were all uncomfortable, and those with weaker cultivation levels were even directly weak on the ground.
<br><br>But Bone Ben Wei was full of disdain.
<br><br>"Less in front of this scum, forced to chatter, and who pretend it you, most annoying you such things, hurry up and get down to talk!"
<br><br>Said, skeleton Ben Wei palm pick up a vine, and subsequently fell in the hands.
<br><br>With that, a gentle pull!
<br><br>Watching Bone Ben Wei's action, the big face in the sky immediately revealed a contemptuous look.
<br><br>But the next moment, his face changed violently.
<br><br>Because of the countless tree strips and vines connected under him, one of them suddenly came with a power that shook him.
<br><br>Under this powerful force, he simply could not resist, the whole big face was pulled down with a bang.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>It was like the collapse of a mountain peak, causing a huge shadow to appear on the ground.
