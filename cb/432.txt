"He went into that small store."
<br><br>"Could it be that the expert is in this store?"
<br><br>"Don't rush, wait and see what happens."
<br><br>"Yes, calm down, anyway, we just keep a dead eye on the old pipsqueak Night Energy, sooner or later the water will fall out."
<br><br>The four men exchanged glances, then quietly dived down.
<br><br>As he entered, Night Energy's eyes slightly mimicked, and then looked at Yi Feng who was talking and laughing.
<br><br>"Mister must not put the four of them in his eyes either."
<br><br>"Since mister doesn't care either, I'd better not take matters into my own hands."
<br><br>Thinking like this, he sat down with the wine jug in his arms.
<br><br>"Sir, the wine is here."
<br><br>"Well, it seems good, quite good." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>Getting Yi Feng's appreciation, Night Energy was extremely excited.
<br><br>A group of people, with a happy atmosphere, began to eat.
<br><br>Home-cooked light meals, but also unusual, small wine and meat half an hour has eaten.
<br><br>"By the way mother, brother Yi Feng is not only my fellow disciple, he is also considered my half master." Xiaodai said with excitement, "Because Brother Yi Feng, ah, not only taught me to write, taught me to draw, but also taught me to carve."
<br><br>"Really?" Yun mother said with a big smile, "Quickly show me, how is your writing and drawing?"
<br><br>"Good, you wait for me to find it."
<br><br>Xiaodai said with a leap of faith, and then rummaged around in her storage bag.
<br><br>And aside, night can hear the conversation between mother and daughter, elbow can't help but bump the night Yi.
<br><br>"I said this little girl is only a third level martial artist, how come she has such a good relationship with mister, it turns out that mister has gotten mister's favor."
<br><br>"Remember, this little girl must be befriended."
<br><br>Night Energy transmitted a voice to explain.
<br><br>"Understood." Night Yi solemnly nodded, eyes dense with envy, but then could not help but ask by voice transmission, "But this little girl does not look special ah, talent also seems to be very ordinary, why can be selected by Mr.."
<br><br>"Shhh."
<br><br>"Must not say so, you must understand, to be able to be looked at by Mr., there must be his reason, we must not speculate, since this little girl quite like you, you and her good contact."
<br><br>Night can solemnly explained.
<br><br>"I understand father."
<br><br>Night Yi hurriedly shut her mouth.
<br><br>After some searching by Xiao Mai, a statue, a painting was placed on the table.
<br><br>"Look, mother, this is the statue and the painting that brother Yi Feng taught me to carve." Xiaodai said excitedly.
<br><br>At that, Mother Yun and Night Energy, father and daughter, hurriedly looked their eyes over.
<br><br>"Gah."
<br><br>This did not look at it, and made the two of them, father and daughter of Night Energy, jump with a violent shock.
<br><br>"The power of the Great Dao, this painting actually contains the power of the Great Dao."
<br><br>Night Neng stared, his body shivered, and his voice shocked as he sent out a transmission towards Night Yi.
<br><br>"And that statue, I felt a strong pressure as well as pure power on it, if the power inside is released, it is hard to imagine what kind of power there will be in it!"
<br><br>"It's really hard to imagine that two such supreme treasures actually came from a young girl who is a third level martial artist."
<br><br>"It really deserves to be the disciple of the senior."
<br><br>Night Yi was equally full of shock as well as incredulity.
<br><br>However, Yunmu did not know the statue as well as the power in the painting, she only thought the painting was nice and the sculpture was lifelike, and couldn't stop smiling while holding it in her hand and observing it.
<br><br>"Really good, really good, my daughter is really great." Yun mother face gratified.
<br><br>"Hey, that's all because Brother Yi Feng has taught her well." Xiaodai said with a smile.
<br><br>"Thank you so much, Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Yun mother got up and said politely.
<br><br>"Auntie mother is polite, it's all because Xiaodai has good talent, I just mentioned a couple of things." Yi Feng got up to support Yun mother and said modestly.
<br><br>"Mother, I'll give you this statue and painting, you can look at my painting and statue when you miss me at home." Xiaodai said at this time.
<br><br>"Good, good."
<br><br>"I'll frame this painting in a frame and hang it on the wall, and I'll put this statue in the most prominent place so that more people can see my daughter's handiwork."
<br><br>Looking extremely proud of her daughter's talent, Yun's mother put the painting and statue away.
<br><br>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, it was finally time to leave.
<br><br>Night Energy was the first to step out of the small store.
<br><br>At this moment, the four great patriarchs who were waiting outside and dozing off were stunned.
<br><br>"Coming out."
<br><br>The four of them instantly shot up.
