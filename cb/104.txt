For a moment, all three hearts were stuck in their throats.
<br><br>Yet the gentleman ignored their words, leaving them feeling powerless.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What they did not expect was that those formations seemed to be immune to Yi Feng seemingly, Yi Feng just walked straight over and actually did not do anything half-heartedly.
<br><br>Such a scene.
<br><br>Let the three look dumbfounded, the brain half can not turn to God, until Yi Feng walked to less than half a foot in front of them, they looked at each other, took a deep breath, revealing a shocked gaze.
<br><br>Original.
<br><br>It turned out that they still underestimated Mr.
<br><br>Mister's terror had surpassed their perception, and could even be so strong as to ignore ancient formations.
<br><br>Tsk.
<br><br>"We, the others, have met sir." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The three greeted Yi Feng respectfully, excited to the extreme.
<br><br>"No need to be so polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, but he was used to it, since this life, he did it with a conscience, and also got the respect of many people, called master there, called both sir and master ......
<br><br>"Sir, we have been stuck here for a long time." The three said with hot tears, "Thank you, sir, for rushing here."
<br><br>Stuck here for a long time?
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned and took a look at the feet of the three, the mud was sparse and there was indeed a big puddle of water.
<br><br>But this is not a swamp, ah, just a puddle of water this also trapped out?
<br><br>These three people are really pretentious ah!
<br><br>But remember that this is three old men, but also understandable.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>I'll give you a hand if I come across it!
<br><br>"Come on."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng stretched out his palm and said softly.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's action, the three looked at each other and said, full of doubts, "Sir, you may not care about this kind of dangerous place, but we are trapped in it, do we just come out?"
<br><br>It seemed.
<br><br>Isn't it a bit too hasty.
<br><br>Sir at least have to untie the big formation, right?
<br><br>But Yi Feng frowned, a little unhappy, a broken puddle do I still have to carry you out?
<br><br>These three old men are really pretentious to death ah!
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng displeased, the three immediately understood that their questioning had caused Mr. displeasure, did not dare to speak again, and hastily pulled Yi Feng's palm, will be convinced to prepare to come out.
<br><br>However, what they did not expect was that Wu Yonghong was pulled out smoothly without any obstruction or surprise.
<br><br>Subsequently, the second, the third, also the same without any accident and block, as if the formation failed to general.
<br><br>But clearly, they did not see Yi Feng break the formation or make any other moves ah!
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>The three people's eyes were unbelievable, and their respect for Yi Feng was even more heartfelt.
<br><br>They found that they had once again underestimated Yi Feng.
<br><br>Not only could they themselves ignore the formation, but even they who were following them were directly immune.
<br><br>What kind of cultivation did one have to have to be able to do this?
<br><br>"Thank you, sir, for saving me."
<br><br>The three of them respectfully said thank you.
<br><br>"There is nothing to thank, just a broken puddle!" Yi Feng waved his hand and said indifferently.
<br><br>Broken puddle?
<br><br>I'm afraid that only someone like Mr. can call this kind of dangerous place a broken puddle!
<br><br>"By the way sir, old Wu he ...... was injured, you see ......." At this time, Chu Mad Lion seemed to remember something, expectantly towards Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Old Chu, don't say it, don't bother sir anymore." Wu Yonghong hurriedly said, "Besides, this kind of injury of mine is simply powerless to return to heaven, so what's the use of bothering Mr."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled with some interest and said, "Come and show me your injury."
<br><br>"Sir, I have this ......"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong really did not want to trouble Yi Feng, besides his Dantian was ruined, it was difficult for the gods to heal.
<br><br>"It's okay to take a look." Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>"Okay ...... okay."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong opened his mouth and lifted his clothes to reveal his small abdomen.
<br><br>There, there was a bloody hole, and the Dantian in his body had long since ruptured.
<br><br>"It's indeed a bit serious."
<br><br>Yi Feng took a look.
<br><br>Smiling, Wu Yonghong's face wilted, indeed, such a thing as a broken dantian, even Mr. There is nothing that can be done.
<br><br>But just as he thought that, Yi Feng came back with a voice.
<br><br>"Although a little serious, but it's not hopeless, turn around and I'll get you an herbal compress and you'll be fine."
