"Something seems to have happened to the children."
<br><br>Beside Ao Qing, Ao Qingcheng said with a worried face.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Ao Qing asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"It seems they ran a thousand miles away, copied a clan, and after taking turns to be the clan leader for a day, they ran towards other places in Eastern Victory." Ao Qingcheng said.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"This sons of mine, a little bit of my look!" Ao Qing heard was not worried but happy, and laughed heartily.
<br><br>"Aiya, how do you not worry at all ah, the children are still so small, in case they encounter bad people how to do?" Ao Qingcheng chopped her jade feet and said, obviously, after the two people broke the barrier, the relationship has long been different from before.
<br><br>The once haughty her, now in front of Ao Qing is as small as a woman.
<br><br>"You should not worry about theirs, you do not look at their strength, which bad guys dare to kick such an iron plate?"
<br><br>Ao Qing said with a smile: "On the contrary, you our naughty sons, will not take this continent apart thank goodness." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At these words, Ao Qingcheng then nodded comfortably.
<br><br>Thinking about it is also.
<br><br>Seven immortals.
<br><br>This is simply completely rollable in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>"Well, for the time being, let them play outside for a while, you also tribe inside to absorb absorb the pills I gave you, that big sack of pills, should be enough to improve your strength a lot." Ao Qing said softly: "When the time comes, then you and the children together to the master's side."
<br><br>"Must we leave so soon in a hurry?"
<br><br>There was some reluctance on Ao Qingcheng's face.
<br><br>"The master will be unhappy if you go out for too long." Ao Qing lamented.
<br><br>"Okay, fine!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng lowered her head and seemed to remember something else, and said in a hurry, "Right, your brother Ao Tie has been thinking about the throne of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, if you leave, won't you give up this throne to someone else?"
<br><br>Ao Qing glanced at Ao Qingcheng and suddenly laughed.
<br><br>"What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng asked in confusion.
<br><br>"Daughter-in-law, the pattern ah!"
<br><br>Ao Qing couldn't help but say, "Do you think this little Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf's throne, I will still look at it?"
<br><br>"As for Ao Tie, let him be, it doesn't matter if this throne is given to him."
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng staggered her tongue.
<br><br>Looking at Ao Qing's look of full concern, she suddenly realized with surprise that she could no longer keep up with Ao Qing's eyesight.
<br><br>This man of hers had also long since ceased to be confined to a small Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe.
<br><br>"Seniors, are we going to set off now."
<br><br>And at the side, Milk Leopard Li asked in a low voice.
<br><br>A few days ago, she variously pleaded, plus poured out her family's money, and worked as a hard laborer in the Sky-devouring Demon Wolf for a few days, before finally Bone Ben Wei reluctantly intended to bring her back to the back mountain.
<br><br>Subsequently the strength is worse, but at least it is a beast.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei nodded, after some goodbyes, before taking Ao Qing milk dose and others then set off on the trip.
<br><br>The edge of the plains out.
<br><br>The three demonic beasts of the Rhinoceros Forest were lying on the ground, with a look of hatred running down their faces.
<br><br>"That black-robed man and that human are powerful, but we will never submit to them."
<br><br>"Yes, they want to treat us as playthings in their hands, and we absolutely can't give in."
<br><br>"But we still have to think of a way to escape from here!"
<br><br>"Lao Er is right, it is necessary to think of a way."
<br><br>The three demons were thinking this way when Rhinoceros Lin's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>"If I remember well, the milk leopard Li seems to be in East Victory?" Rhinoceros Lin asked.
<br><br>Hearing that, the eyes of the remaining two demons also instantly lit up.
<br><br>"Yes big brother, we just need to release a message to Milk Leopard Li, and they can come to our rescue."
