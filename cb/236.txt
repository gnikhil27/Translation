"You are the leader?"
<br><br>The woman in green turned her gaze to Yi Feng and said in a deep voice, "You heard what I said just now, I just need to take your carriage to Nansha, and I, as a cultivator, although I am seriously injured, will be able to keep you safe all the way!"
<br><br>"Uh, a cultivator, it won't cause trouble, right?" Yi Feng touched his nose and said with a frown.
<br><br>At these words, the woman in green was slightly silent.
<br><br>A moment later reared her head and said, "Frankly speaking to you, it is indeed possible to bring trouble, but this possibility is minimal equivalent to none, because they have all been killed by me, unless they send reinforcements over again!"
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, this woman is willing to frankly say so, but let him trust her a few points.
<br><br>"Okay, it's okay to take you for a ride, but this risky thing, there must be some reward, right?" Yi Feng said with a smirk.
<br><br>"Then what do you want?"
<br><br>The woman in green said.
<br><br>"Uh, five hundred, no, a thousand gold coins!" Yi Feng said with his hand outstretched. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The woman didn't have second thoughts, pulled out a gold ticket from her storage ring and waved it towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"This is a gold ticket of one thousand gold coins, you can get the gold coins at any money changer." The woman in green said.
<br><br>"Rash!"
<br><br>This woman was so bold, she didn't even talk about the price, which made Yi Feng feel regretful, he should have asked for more if he had known.
<br><br>"All right, then you get in!"
<br><br>Put away the golden ticket, Yi Feng beckoned, but before she got into the car and reminded: "Right, we are here in addition to me, and the pork rong in front of a little strength, the other are old arms and legs, you said no trouble, can not pit us ah!"
<br><br>"Don't worry!"
<br><br>The woman in green coldly said: "There is really trouble will not drag you guys."
<br><br>"You, move a floor for people."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a kick towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>The dog looked at the woman in green and moved towards the corner.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>But however, the woman in green clothes looked her puzzled gaze at Ao Qing, she always felt that Ao Qing was very much like the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, but the latter's body did not have the slightest aura of a demon wolf.
<br><br>The dog gave her a blank look.
<br><br>He did not dare to ignore his master's reminder to keep a low profile at all times when he left home.
<br><br>So he converged all his breath, and a subtle change appeared on his body.
<br><br>So now, even a Martial Saint in front of him would not be able to recognize him as a Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, this smelly sister can see it is really a ghost.
<br><br>"Your injury, nothing is wrong, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the wound on the green-clothed woman's shoulder and frowned, that knife came down to the bone, how painful it must be!
<br><br>"I'm fine, you don't have to worry!" The woman in green waved her hand and said.
<br><br>"How about I help you take a look?" Yi Feng said softly: "I know a lot about medicine, maybe I can help you."
<br><br>At those words, Grand Master Wang, who was also sitting in the carriage, gave Yi Feng a respectful look.
<br><br>Sir is greatly kind.
<br><br>Even in the face of this kind of unenlightened offspring, he always holds compassion.
<br><br>To be able to make the gentleman's hand, I don't know how many lifetimes this junior's ancestors have been blessed.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>The woman in green gave Yi Feng a look and shook her head, "This is not an ordinary injury, kindly accepted, but not something that a mortal like you can fix."
<br><br>"Uh, okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng touched his nose to resolve his embarrassment.
<br><br>But the old king's head on the side was looking at the woman like a fool, how stupid did he have to be to turn Mr. down?
<br><br>The ancestors accumulated several lifetimes of blessings were cut off by their own hands, I really do not know after knowing the might of Mr., will not regret hanging themselves.
<br><br>But that's all.
<br><br>Mr. do not say anything, he certainly will not say a word, just a frog at the bottom of the well, always do not know the sky is big ah!
<br><br>"You guys keep going, I'll take care of any trouble!"
<br><br>The woman in green clothes will be wounded after a simple bandage, instructed, then closed his eyes and began to heal.
<br><br>The caravan, slowly moving forward.
<br><br>A day passed, is already far away from the Pingjiang City.
<br><br>This immortal river continent is not compared to the previous world, the territory does not know how wide, in addition to some cities and human gathering places, most other places are in the undeveloped area, surrounded by a barren few people.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>Just at this moment, the sound of drawing swords suddenly came from outside.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the curtain to take a look, and instantly found a group of fierce and vicious people surrounding them.
<br><br>"Mountain bandits?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face instantly changed.
<br><br>"This road is planted by me, this road is opened by me, want to cross this road, leave the money to buy the road!"
<br><br>The man at the head was eight feet tall, with a full head of hair, waving the big sword in his hand and drinking: "Master Kuang Gang of Qingfeng Village is here, people in the car, get down!"
<br><br>"Get down."
<br><br>As the leader Kuang Gang bellowed, the rest of the bandits also bellowed in unison, their auras exposed.
<br><br>What one did not expect was that this group of mountain bandits were still very strong, and the leader Kuang Gang had even reached the ninth level of a warrior, and was only one foot away from being a martial master.
<br><br>"Girl, girl, come mountain bandits."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hurriedly shouted towards the woman in green behind him.
<br><br>"I am at a critical moment, you guys hold on for a moment, a quarter of an hour later I will strike to solve." The woman in green said solemnly, and closed her eyes again.
<br><br>Yi Feng just wanted to say something else, but looking at the cold sweat on her forehead, as well as the cold air coming out of the wound, also know that the latter may really be in what a critical moment, had to stop.
<br><br>It seems that the only way to be able to be their own solution.
<br><br>Saying that, he stepped down from the carriage.
<br><br>"Sir, what should we do?"
<br><br>Porky Rong and Wu Yonghong and the others turned their eyes to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Some of them are considered cultivators, we mortals can't fight against them for sure, pay to settle it!"
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng gritted his teeth, full of flesh, took out a hundred gold coins from the Ring of Space, packed them up in a bag, and walked towards Kuang Gang and the others.
<br><br>"Hey, gentlemen, here is a hundred gold coins, buy a right of passage!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said as he held out the money bag.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Quite up to date!"
<br><br>Kuang just took the money bag in his hand, weighed it, but then sneered: "I see the ring on your hand is not bad, also give it to me!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face changed and he hurriedly took a step back, forcing a smile and said, "I don't want this!"
<br><br>"Then you can all go to hell collectively!"
<br><br>Kuang Gang sneered, and with a wave of his palm, twenty to thirty mountain bandits lunged towards Yi Feng and the others.
<br><br>"Shit!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed, this mountain bandits really have no moral righteousness to speak of, I am afraid that they will not let them go whether they pay or not.
<br><br>While retreating, while shouting towards the crowd, "Everyone hold on, hold on for a quarter of an hour, just wait for that who strikes."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng also felt a sword from his hand, just cut one person, but found seven or eight large swords cut towards him.
<br><br>"Grrrr!"
<br><br>Yi Feng ran and fought at the same time, although he had practiced a lot of national arts, but really fought with these bloodthirsty, but still goose ah!
<br><br>Panic a batch.
<br><br>And Pork Rong and the others also dismounted and started fighting with the mountain bandits.
<br><br>"Hey!"
<br><br>"Ha!"
<br><br>A few people waved their palms expressionlessly, seemingly in style, even fighting back and forth with these martial artists, but the calmness on their faces betrayed them.
<br><br>And rushed to the carriage of several mountain bandits, also and the old man Wang started a tangle, looking at the old king who can not even walk on the propped cane road but not the slightest panic, swimming in the dodge.
<br><br>"We are mortals, facing the mountain bandits is not too calm?"
<br><br>Pork Rong while pretending to tangle with the mountain bandits, but while shouting at the old king and his men.
<br><br>"Yes, Mr. sense of mortal life, we follow him also must always cooperate with Mr., set itself ah!" Old Wang Tau also nodded in deep agreement and said, "Look at Mr. like that, only mortals encounter mountain bandits should look like ah!"
<br><br>"What about us?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong asked.
<br><br>But just as he asked, he found the old king's head sitting on his ass on the ground, trembling body, mouth ghostly cry towards those mountain bandits shouted: "You, cough cough, help, help, you do not come over ah, do not come over ah ......"
