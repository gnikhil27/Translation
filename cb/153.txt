"You, you you you ......"
<br><br>Ao Qing's words filled Ao Qingcheng with shock.
<br><br>After the shock, her face turned blue with anger.
<br><br>"You don't have to pretend, the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, a noble race, it's just as well that you can say things like recognizing humans as your master, but you still want to blow your cowl through the sky."
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng angrily shot back at Ao Qing and said without any politeness, "It's harder for a demon king to reach a demon emperor, but to break through to a demon emperor within half a year, how can you say that?"
<br><br>"And the holy treasures you think you can get at your fingertips? Also emperor products, please play a draft of your bragging, okay?"
<br><br>"As for what you said about the master and the skull, I think it's just a waste similar to you, and disrespectful to Demon King Song Ke, you are really naive!"
<br><br>Seeing that Ao Qing did not speak, Ao Qingcheng's face was mocking, showing a look like she was right, raising the corner of her mouth to strike out painfully.
<br><br>"How about it, the taste of a lie being torn down is not pleasant, right, if it is not a lie, you call your what master and skeleton to come and see in front of my Red Sun lineage, huh?"
<br><br>After saying that, her pair of beautiful pupils looked straight at Ao Qing.
<br><br>She wanted to see Ao Qing reveal a furious and panicked look because of the lie being uncovered, and then obediently obey to be used for her. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But.
<br><br>In once out of her expectation, Ao Qing not only did not get angry and flustered, but also shook his head and looked at her.
<br><br>That eyes.
<br><br>It was full of contempt.
<br><br>"Forget it, I'm too lazy to argue with you, we're not on the same level anymore!"
<br><br>Ao Qing said rather uninterestedly.
<br><br>At this moment Ao Qingcheng can not even provoke him to quarrel, after all, the frog at the bottom of the well, how will know how big the sky is?
<br><br>As for telling his master and skeleton brother to go to the Red Sun lineage to see, he felt even more ridiculous to the extreme. That is, they simply do not see, otherwise really go, just a fart can be shaken them to oblivion.
<br><br>Did not want to say one more word of Y hope, dog Ao Qing turned around and left.
<br><br>Looking at the back of the dog Ao Qing left, Ao Qingcheng whole person was stunned in place, the country's face has become distorted, gloomy can drip out water.
<br><br>This waste of time, which she had never treated as a fop and never looked at in her eyes, actually mocked and despised her, the proud daughter of the sky, at this moment.
<br><br>How dare he?
<br><br>How could he!
<br><br>"Stop right there!" She shouted furiously.
<br><br>However, Ao Qing ignored it.
<br><br>"Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?"
<br><br>She was furious and her powerful pressure pressed towards Ao Qing overwhelmingly.
<br><br>But Ao Qing but still ignored, one is he expected Ao Qingcheng because of the secret realm will not make a move on him, the second is he did not think Ao Qingcheng killed himself, perhaps the fight up must not be an opponent, but want to escape he still have some confidence.
<br><br>After all, with the master for so long, really think he has no half cards?
<br><br>As expected, Ao Qingcheng until Ao Qing's figure disappeared from sight, but also still trembling palms did not make a move.
<br><br>Instead, his chest heaving with anger, his body trembling, his body emitting a powerful anger.
<br><br>Under this powerful anger and pressure, the hundred feet range has turned into a vacuum, in addition to a few black-robed people, there is no longer a living thing.
<br><br>"Bang Bang Bang Bang ......"
<br><br>The delightful sound of sonic booms rang out again one after another, causing countless huge rocks to burst, as a way to vent her anger.
<br><br>Good long long long ......
<br><br>She only regained some peace.
<br><br>Seeing this, a man in black beside her only came and cautiously asked, "Holy Maiden, just let him go?"
<br><br>"Humph, how is that possible?"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng said icily, "I have imposed the unique tracking of my Red Sun Clan on him, I would like to follow him over and see what his so-called human master really is."
<br><br>"I will even see if he will still have this arrogance when I trample this human master of his underfoot in front of his face!"
<br><br>"When the pillar in his heart collapses, it will be the time when he will obediently kneel beside me, lick my feet, and beg to do my work."
<br><br>"Holy Maiden is highly intelligent!"
<br><br>Several men in black flashed their eyes in admiration, and respectful voices came out.
<br><br>Seemingly, they had already seen the scene of Ao Qing prostrating in front of the divine Maiden.
