Although these old men were well hidden, but due to the cultivation of special techniques, Guan Yunpeng could see at a glance that these old men were actually all Martial Exalted.
<br><br>He drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>Usually can not find the old monsters, actually piled up here?
<br><br>He, a Martial Sect Perfection, naturally didn't dare to be rude when he saw a Martial Dignity, so he quickly bowed and shouted, "Greetings to the three seniors."
<br><br>Hearing this, Wu Yonghong three people also looked at this new arrival, frowned at once. All are showing a look, young man you do not wake up.
<br><br>Waved a hand and said: "You are mistaken, we three are not what seniors, we are just mortals!"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng a shiver.
<br><br>Again.
<br><br>He is a fucking mortal?
<br><br>With doubts, he just wanted to ask again, but found Wu Yonghong glaring at him.
<br><br>Seeing this, he hurriedly shut up and had to temporarily suppress the doubts in his heart, and then ask for clarification when he had time. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Oh, you three are here!" Yi Feng smiled and said, "Just in time to come, is there any word you want me to write today?"
<br><br>"No no sir."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, no need to bother sir today."
<br><br>"Yes, I still have a dozen copies of sir's calligraphy and paintings there, and I haven't even finished enjoying them yet."
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Yonghong and the three of them hastily waved their hands and politely refused Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Yonghong three people were relieved.
<br><br>During this period of time, working here at Yi Feng's place, only then did they try out what was called chance, and they each received more than ten copies of various calligraphy and paintings that contained martial intent and dao rhythm.
<br><br>Originally, this kind of treasure, they are sure to come.
<br><br>But Mr. Naive word painting contains the dao is too profound, even the first verse they have not yet comprehended, the rest of those are enough for them to comprehend a lifetime, if they come again, they must be supported by the fire into the inevitable.
<br><br>However, Rolling Yunpeng on the side was already stunned.
<br><br>He obviously heard the meaning of Wu Yonghong and the others.
<br><br>They had actually gotten so many benefits that they had even gotten so much that they couldn't hold on anymore?
<br><br>He instantly revealed a sizzling light.
<br><br>Therefore, after leaving the martial school, he hurriedly followed Wu Yonghong and the others.
<br><br>"Seniors, seniors."
<br><br>He shouted, while taking out a few gourds of good wine from his storage ring in filial respect.
<br><br>"Not bad, quite up to date!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people put away the good wine, smiling at Guan Yunpeng.
<br><br>"A few seniors are joking." Guan Yunpeng respectfully lowered his head and asked the first doubt in his heart, "A few seniors, I would like to ask, why that senior said he was a mortal, even you also?"
<br><br>At that, Wu Yonghong several people looked at him like a fool, shaking his head.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng also did not dare to get angry, and hurriedly asked, "Please also ask a few seniors to speak straight."
<br><br>"You are a foolish person!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong said with a lecture tone: "To tell you the truth, Mr. both cultivation and state of mind, has long reached the realm of returning to the basics, and thus came to this small city to experience mortal life, he not only truly treats himself as a mortal, and even everything personally, and we people, naturally, are to cooperate with the seniors."
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was then enlightened, and remembering his recklessness just now, he revealed a look of fear.
<br><br>Almost, he had rushed the seniors ah.
<br><br>He couldn't help but look towards Wu Yonghong, filled with gratitude.
<br><br>"By the way, can the three seniors tell me, what exactly is, what cultivation level is sir?" He asked again.
<br><br>"What do you think?" Sun Zhuge said leisurely.
<br><br>"Martial Saint?" He asked.
<br><br>Several people in Sun Zhuge revealed contemptuous gazes.
<br><br>"Could it be the Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng uttered incredulously.
<br><br>But however, Wu Yonghong shook his head, patted him on the shoulder, and sighed, "Houshang ah, we really don't have much interest in talking to you anymore, after all, your eyesight is too low."
<br><br>"Eyesight is too low?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's mind was like a thunderbolt ringing in his head.
<br><br>"Mo Fei!"
<br><br>"Could it be that he is ......"
<br><br>Before he could finish, Wu Yonghong several people interrupted him, "It's good to know, it's your blessing to be here today, make good use of it!"
<br><br>After saying that, Wu Yonghong a few people want to leave.
<br><br>But Guan Yunpeng did not die, and hurriedly chased after him and asked again, "Are you guys following the gentleman for a long time?"
<br><br>"Of course!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong said proudly as they subconsciously puffed out their chests.
<br><br>At these words, Guan Yunpeng immediately revealed an envious look and hurriedly asked again, "Then, seniors, can you teach me how to follow beside the gentleman?"
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people looked up and down Guan Yunpeng, shook his head and said, "Pick dung last night seems to have broken through the martial daddy, you're not quite good enough."
<br><br>Saying that, the three turned around and left.
<br><br>And Guan Yunpeng was stunned on the spot.
<br><br>The dung pickers, all broke through the martial dwelling?
<br><br>He was flooded with sizzling light, and made up his mind in his heart that he must find a way to follow this person's side.
<br><br>But now, I still need to go back to the cave, first to comprehend the three words sent by Mr., break through the martial dwelling and then come back.
<br><br>After saying that, Guan Yunpeng swept away in the air and left.
<br><br>After returning to the cave of Nansha, he closed his door and spent the whole day studying the three words sent by Yi Feng, and finally, three days later, he broke through the Martial Dignity realm directly.
<br><br>Leaving the cave, he was just about to go to Pingjiang City again when he noticed a stream of light cutting in the distance.
<br><br>"Shake the Sky Que?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was startled to see that it was this old friend and greeted him with a smile.
<br><br>"Huh, how come you're not dead, Guan Yunpeng?" Shake Heavenly Que looked at Guan Yunpeng in surprise and asked, "I just got the news that the Black Sword is after you, I wanted to come over to help you, how come you are fine in the cave?"
<br><br>"You're kind, but it's not necessary to help me!" Guan Yunpeng said proudly: "I have already broken through the Martial Exaltation."
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>The aura of his body was fiercely revealed.
<br><br>Seeing this, Shaking Heavenly Que was astonished and asked with astonishment, "Your cultivation level was obviously lower than mine before, how did you break through to Martial Exaltation, how is this possible?"
<br><br>"Nothing is impossible!" Guan Yunpeng said with a smile, "After all, I recently got a big chance."
<br><br>"What chance?" Shaking Heavenly Que was busy asking.
<br><br>"Look."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng took out the rice paper and immediately revealed a strong sword intent.
<br><br>"What a powerful sword intent, where did you get this?" Shaking Tian Que drew a breath of cold air backwards, looked at Guan Yun Peng with envy and hurriedly asked.
<br><br>"It was gifted to me by a high ranking person before, and I am now on my way to join him." Guan Yunpeng was full of reverence, looking at his old friend who was full of envy next to him, he inquired, "How about you go with me?"
<br><br>"May I?"
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que's eyes lit up and he was instantly moved.
<br><br>"This senior has spared no effort in bringing up our juniors, I think if I go respectfully, even if I can't follow the senior, it's still feasible to ask for a chance." Guan Yunpeng said.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que open mouth to agree, excited body are a little trembling, Guan Yunpeng that the sword intent inside the rice paper, he can see clearly, he has been suffering to break through the martial daddy, and there is such a good thing, naturally is impatient.
<br><br>"By the way, where is the senior you mentioned?" Shaking Heavenly Que asked again.
<br><br>"Pingjiang City!"
<br><br>"Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>Shake Heavenly Que's eyes lit up, raised the corners of his mouth and smiled: "That's even better, it just so happens that a snitch from Pingjiang City has bullied my disciple and is about to take revenge, this time going there will be a twofer."
