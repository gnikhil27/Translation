Why?
<br><br>Why would the four great martial arts masters, actually call this youth so respectfully as sir.
<br><br>Could it be that?
<br><br>This martial arts school does not belong to Wu Yonghong four people, this youth in front of you is the real behind the scenes?
<br><br>Can't help but.
<br><br>He recalled what Demon Ling'er said, it was this youth who ordered people to use the Swift Cloak as a rag, and it was also this youth who used Pure Windless' bones as rations for the dogs.
<br><br>At the thought of this, Ning Xuanwu felt extremely unbelievable.
<br><br>But even if he was unbelievable, he felt that this answer was eight or nine.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong four people to Yi Feng's level of respect first, he as a Martial King strength, found that also can not see through the strength of this young expert in front of him.
<br><br>Just like a mortal.
<br><br>Seemingly mediocre, but actually unfathomable! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At this thought, he deeply swallowed a mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>"Sir, he is here to ......" After greeting Yi Feng, Wu Yonghong said respectfully, obviously wanting to report the matter of Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"No need to say it, I know."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said with a smile.
<br><br>"Sir is powerful, it's us who talk too much." Wu Yonghong four people looked at each other, immediately respectfully bowed their heads, it seems that sir is sir, even if people are no longer here, the things here have long known ah.
<br><br>"There is nothing to talk too much."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>He just walked out the door, just heard Chu Mad Lion in teaching the kneeling uncle on the ground here, listen to what the seniors and juniors, it is estimated that they are teaching the juniors!
<br><br>The old man well.
<br><br>See the offspring caught a lesson, is also understandable, just do not know what the uncle in the end made a mistake.
<br><br>The side of the kneeling Ning Xuanwu also opened his mouth wide, while the intestines also regret the green.
<br><br>The eyes showed a deep fear.
<br><br>He is now sure that this mysterious youth in front of him is an old monster who is older than Wu Yonghong and others, and he actually blindly hit the door, all unaware that people know everything.
<br><br>The thought of offending such a person, he felt a chill down his back, his face was as white as a sheet of paper.
<br><br>Today, he was afraid that he would have to explain here.
<br><br>"It's okay, you guys just deal with it." Yi Feng said indifferently, even at the entrance of his martial arts school, it would have no effect on him.
<br><br>"We deal with it?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong four people were slightly surprised, looked at each other, did not expect Yi Feng directly handed Ning Xuanwu to them to deal with.
<br><br>But it was true, a small Martial King, I'm afraid it wasn't enough for Mr. personally to be concerned.
<br><br>Just, in the end, how to dispose of it?
<br><br>The four of them looked at me, I looked at you, no one could decide, they could only look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What are you guys looking at me for?" Yi Feng asked speechlessly.
<br><br>"Ahem, sir, we just want to ask, in your opinion, what is the best way to dispose of it?" Wu Yonghong spoke up and asked apprehensively.
<br><br>On the side, Ning Xuanwu, whose face was miserable white, also looked his gaze over.
<br><br>The usually majestic man in the Xuanwu Sect actually became pitiful, he understood that his own little life could be completely in Yi Feng's hands.
<br><br>"Ask me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his nose.
<br><br>Quite speechless, your own juniors to teach a lesson, ask me, an irrelevant person what?
<br><br>Looking at the four old man has been inquiring look, Yi Feng had to helplessly said: "I have nothing to say, but I mean since the mistake is certainly to bear the corresponding consequences, of course, the treatment of juniors can not not give him the opportunity, after the lesson he can not be an adult, depending on his own destiny."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng looked at the sky and thought it was almost time to cook dinner.
<br><br>After all, Zhong Qing has been working alone all day, and it is reasonable for him, as a master, to help him share the burden occasionally.
<br><br>Besides, they are teaching their juniors, it is not good for him to be around.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Wu Yonghong four people speculated on Yi Feng's words, then looked at each other and nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Sir's meaning was already obvious.
<br><br>Afterwards, four pairs of gloomy eyes fell on Ning Xuanwu's body.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu shuddered violently and was instantly covered in sweat.
<br><br>"Storage bag, take it out first!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong extended his palm and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Before, senior, this is not necessary, right?" Ning Xuanwu said with an ugly face.
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong's voice sank as he narrowed his eyes and said, "Did you not hear what sir just said?"
<br><br>"Fine, fine!"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu clenched his teeth and took out his storage bag with a face full of reluctance. Inside, apart from the last supreme treasure he had on him, were the resources of the entire Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>The moment the bag was snatched away by Wu Yonghong, Ning Xuanwu's heart was dripping blood.
<br><br>"Hmm."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong opened the storage bag and took a look at it, nodded in satisfaction, handed it over to Chu Mad Lion, and then instructed, "You take it first, and give it to sir later."
<br><br>After saying that, he looked at Ning Xuanwu and said in a deep voice: "You get up first!"
<br><br>At these words, Ning Xuanwu then got up, and looking at the four people's faces, he asked apprehensively, "Then four seniors, I, I can go now, right?"
<br><br>After saying that, he lifted his legs, impatiently wanting to leave this place.
<br><br>However, just as he lifted his feet, a mighty pressure came at him again.
<br><br>"Go?"
<br><br>"Didn't you hear what sir said just now?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong asked with an angry tone, and as he spoke he glanced at the skinny old man Sun Zhuge.
<br><br>Seeing this, Sun Zhuge smiled coldly and waved his palm, a black mist diffused towards Ning Xuanwu, instantly enveloping his entire palm.
<br><br>"This is my Heavenly Fury poison, and it will diffuse from the arm to the whole body in less than three days."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Heavenly Fury Poison?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu smiled, his face as white as paper, looking at the black mist that filled his arm, as if he had seen something horrible.
<br><br>"You heard it yourself, this is the meaning of the gentleman, and did not directly take your life, of course, whether you can still stand as a person or not, it only depends on your fate."
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>With a wave of his arm, Ning Xuanwu directly flew backwards.
