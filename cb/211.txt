"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Lu Qingshan snapped open his eyes.
<br><br>Because he clearly saw just now, from that rare and strange thing in Yi Feng's hand, an invisible energy emerged and shot out through the window dou.
<br><br>"Sir I'll go out first."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan bowed towards Yi Feng and hurriedly rushed out of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Just as he reached the door, he saw a scene that would be hard for him to forget in his life.
<br><br>Along with the appearance of that invisible energy, the unbeatable Prime Finger instantly dissipated.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>In the distance, closely observing the place, the book qin painting, the fifth formation, the fifth long air incredibly shocked out, almost in the same breath. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>For a time, the three people drew a cold breath backwards, their jaws were almost shocked down.
<br><br>What kind of attack is that.
<br><br>In just an instant, it defeated this terrifying finger?
<br><br>However, the next moment appeared as if an explosive thunderstorm rang in their minds.
<br><br>Because that energy after defeating the finger, did not dissipate, but continued to break the air towards Jiang Yu.
<br><br>Jiang Yu, who was full of madness, had not yet reacted to how his one finger was broken when he found his golden body being broken by something.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>This blow directly knocked one of his legs into nothingness.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>In the golden body, Jiang Yu, who was just unbeatable, let out a miserable scream from his mouth and stared at his eyes, filled with fear.
<br><br>At the same time, the imperial zither platform he had stepped on fell to the ground with a rumble, and the Yu Wu Jie in his hand was also thrown away by him.
<br><br>However, what he never expected was that the energy that had just crushed one of his legs did not dissipate, but turned around and attacked towards him again.
<br><br>Jiang Yu's cold breath was straight up.
<br><br>At this moment no longer care about the matter of taking the body, to play an unprecedented speed swept out of the air, desperate to escape.
<br><br>But he was fast, but still did not escape this blow.
<br><br>The crowd only saw the far-fleeing Jiang Yu was hit, emitting a powerful golden body, abruptly turned distorted.
<br><br>It was as if the smoke was broken by the qi energy, suddenly scattered in all directions.
<br><br>Then turned into stars and slowly disappeared.
<br><br>Flying ash annihilation!
<br><br>The whole sky, become calm.
<br><br>The rainstorm that was falling, also at this moment suddenly stopped, restored clarity.
<br><br>Follow this scene of the crowd, a long time to slow down, mouth backwards, feel the cold air all over.
<br><br>The hall Martial Saint.
<br><br>No, a half-emperor who is infinitely close to Martial Emperor!
<br><br>Just like that, he was destroyed?
<br><br>If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believed that such a thing had happened.
<br><br>But even if you see it with your own eyes, it still feels so unreal.
<br><br>"Expert, expert, there are super experts inside this martial hall." After slowing down, the fifth long air pointed to the martial arts hall in the distance and shouted incoherently.
<br><br>Book Qin Painting and the fifth formation simultaneously gave him a white look.
<br><br>Do you still need to say this?
<br><br>And Lu Qingshan also stood at the steps, breathing heavily.
<br><br>He had seen with his own eyes how Yi Feng had executed this strike, and this level of shock of seeing it with his own eyes was really too much for him to calm down.
<br><br>He had thought that Mr. would personally come out of the martial arts school to deal with this person.
<br><br>But did not expect that just sitting inside and raising his hand, the half emperor was annihilated in ashes.
<br><br>Mr. first strike, really is as terrifying as ah!
<br><br>Could not help but glance through the window inside, found Yi Feng lying on the recliner, continue to play with the carving in his hand.
<br><br>Phew.
<br><br>Get killed a half emperor, sir also still this indifferent?
<br><br>It turns out.
<br><br>Even half emperors are not in the eyes of Mr. ah.
<br><br>I don't know how many lifetimes of bad luck he, Lu Qingshan, has had to ride on this big ship.
<br><br>I'm afraid that Mr. make friends simply do not look at other people's cultivation, after all, whether your cultivation is strong or weak, are not as strong as Mr..
<br><br>Suddenly, he saw the fallen emperor's zither table on the ground, and felt his breath become rapid.
<br><br>"The square one, the stone ......"
<br><br>He suddenly remembered Yi Feng's words, and his heart dawned on him.
<br><br>No wonder it, Mr. properly asked him to get what chess board, he a Lu Qingshan where to get a chess board for Yi Feng, now it seems, Mr. said before, is this meaning.
<br><br>It seems that Mr. has long known that this kind of thing will happen just now, this kind of unpredictable ......
<br><br>He drew a cold breath backwards and hurriedly ran back to the martial arts school to report towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Sir, that Jiang Yu in the ancient tomb outside Pingjiang City has been ......"
<br><br>Obviously, he had already guessed that the man just now was Jiang Yu in the ancient tomb, but just as he was halfway through his sentence, he was glared at by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"You keep talking to me about these why, I'm just a mortal, mortal, this cultivation on the matter ah, ancient tomb ah, cave or something I'm not interested." Yi Feng said in a good-natured way, his face was full of depression, this guy simply which pot is not to mention which pot.
<br><br>All these years, he has been for himself can not cultivate, but also get such a garbage system and bad.
<br><br>This old man mentions these things to him every now and then.
<br><br>It is simply a heart attack!
<br><br>Hearing that, Lu Qingshan a shiver, and hurriedly shut his mouth.
<br><br>He then remembered that Mr. living in seclusion here is the sense of ordinary life, and do not want to get involved in the cultivation of things, and this time also because that Jiang Yu is not open-minded to make trouble at the door, only forced to take action.
<br><br>Thinking about it, he gushed a touch of fear.
<br><br>Recently, he has frequently broken his commandments.
<br><br>But fortunately, Mr. did not really angry.
<br><br>But Mr. this reminder, but also gave him a wake-up call, the future in this area should be careful ah.
<br><br>"By the way sir, I will get you the chessboard you need right away." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said again.
<br><br>At that, Yi Feng lifted his head and smiled at Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>I can't believe this old man said he couldn't get it, but he's actually working pretty fast!
<br><br>"Then I'll trouble you to move the backyard for me."
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and took out several dozen gold coins and handed them to Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>Knowing that Yi Feng was paying him from the mortal, Lu Qingshan would accept it and ran out of the door with a faint heart.
<br><br>"Buddy, just now, was it sir who struck?" Seeing Lu Qingshan come out, Wu Yonghong, who was only now slowing down in shock, asked in a quiet voice.
<br><br>"Yes, it was Mr. shot, are you guys okay?" Lu Qingshan asked towards Wu Yonghong.
<br><br>"Mister is really powerful!"
<br><br>Several people couldn't help but praise.
<br><br>"But gentlemen, this ancient tomb thing don't mention, Mr. just want to live an ordinary life, this time to strike is also that Ya not open eyes Mr. only forced to strike, and I just accidentally broke the ring, Mr. already a little angry." Lu Qingshan reminded.
<br><br>At that, several people nodded their heads with understanding.
<br><br>"Come, come, help me to carry this emperor's ...... stone table into the sir, the sir wants to use as a chessboard!" Lu Qingshan shouted.
<br><br>Several people have a hand.
<br><br>For Yi Feng to make Jiang Yu this emperor product piano table into a chessboard, they are not the least bit surprised.
<br><br>After all, even the hoe given to them casually was a holy product, so what if the emperor product was used to play chess?
<br><br>The five people just lifted this zither table, but found that the book qin painting a few people appeared in front of the martial hall.
<br><br>"You ...... you guys this?"
<br><br>The fifth long air stared, could not help but ask.
