What appeared afterwards.
<br><br>Then it was a dog lying in the doorway, attentively wagging its tail.
<br><br>The picture shifted again.
<br><br>It changed again.
<br><br>What followed was the centipede with more than forty legs crossed, was trimming his nails.
<br><br>And after the centipede, there was the big dog bear who had been lying lazily on the ground, drawing circles on his belly.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The image was closed.
<br><br>And the power of the formation and the image disappeared.
<br><br>The sky regained its clarity.
<br><br>However, the whole Genting Palace was excited. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch even pointed at the sky and shouted excitedly, "Hahahaha, we found out, it's the four of them, I said what kind of people have such a big deal, it turns out there are four of them!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the king, congratulations to Lord Perdition, finding out the culprits behind it!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, these four actually dare to go against my Genting Empire, get rid of them!"
<br><br>"Yes, we must get rid of them."
<br><br>"These four things that don't know any better, I suggest, immediately send an expert to capture the four of them!"
<br><br>At a time, the other experts on the scene also sent out encouraging voices, eager to immediately go out and capture these four people back.
<br><br>On the side.
<br><br>Exhausted and somewhat deflated, Perdition also revealed a delighted smile.
<br><br>Although the consumption is huge, but not in vain this reckoning ah!
<br><br>Through his astrological power, he finally found the culprit behind it.
<br><br>But somehow.
<br><br>This three demons a person, quite let him feel some familiar.
<br><br>Especially that tight pants beans shoes, but also let him feel that he had some contact with him.
<br><br>But for a while and can not remember.
<br><br>He did not think much about it.
<br><br>Perhaps he and this three demons a person secretly many times to fight, also considered to have had many contacts, to appear this illusion it!
<br><br>After a short break, the World Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch.
<br><br>Then they returned to the middle of the Genting Palace.
<br><br>"What about it?" Perisher asked.
<br><br>"Naturally, we can't let them go." The Genting Kingdom Monarch clenched his fists and sneered.
<br><br>"How exactly will it be implemented?"
<br><br>Exterminating World said leisurely: "After all, since these three demons alone can be involved in the matter of qi, is definitely not an idle person, except for their appearance, we know nothing, rashly go forward, I'm afraid it is not appropriate ah!"
<br><br>"This you do not worry, I already have a number in mind!"
<br><br>The Genting king raised the corner of his mouth and smiled.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Extinction revealed a curious look.
<br><br>"Under my Genting underground palace, there is a big natural killing formation, the killing formation has a harsh environment, no spiritual energy, and it is filled with the dead spirits left over from the ancient times, even if you and I are in it, we won't last more than seven days."
<br><br>"So, we just need to find them, first use the formation to block them up and imprison them, after the imprisonment, then use the top treasures of my Cloud Top Empire, directly transport them to the underground palace killing formation!"
<br><br>"In this way, we will be able to put them to death without any effort and without taking any risk!" The Genting Kingdom Monarch said leisurely.
<br><br>"Good idea."
<br><br>Perishable eyes instantly lit up, a thump of the thigh passed out an appreciative voice.
<br><br>"As long as one of these three demons dies, it won't be a no-brainer to restore the qi?"
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"So very good, so very good ......"
<br><br>......
<br><br>Under a flower building.
<br><br>Four sneaky shadows appeared.
<br><br>"Big brother, you are really bold!"
<br><br>"Actually stole a whole ten gold coins from the master, he will die if he finds out!" The dog frowned and said with a worried face.
<br><br>"What are you afraid of, men, the peony is dead, the ghost is also a good man!" Skeleton Ben Wei crossed his waist, and then whispered: "Besides, this scum now also learned to be smart, the big deal is not to go back for a while."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Ao Qing's eyes faintly flashed, exclaimed: "Could it be that big brother has thought of some good idea?"
<br><br>"Good idea does not count, anyway, first go out to avoid the wind!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crossed his waist and laughed loudly.
<br><br>A bone three beasts with a bucket hat, then strutted into the red building in front of him.
<br><br>"Enough is enough!"
<br><br>"I'm tired oh tired oh tired!"
<br><br>"Hehehehehe, Miss, I got you."
<br><br>"Hee hee hee hee hee, ha ha ha ha ha ha, really great greatly yo."
<br><br>Among the boxes.
<br><br>The song and dance, as surprisingly chaotic.
<br><br>But the brothers are happy in it.
<br><br>But outside the box, but the danger will come.
<br><br>In order to plan tonight's action, the Genting Empire can be described as out of the nest.
<br><br>The first is around the red building.
<br><br>The first thing is to start setting up the formation without any sound.
<br><br>The two of them personally pressed the formation and personally put a barrier on the Red Building to prevent the people inside from detecting the movement.
<br><br>"How is the formation set up?"
<br><br>Perdition asked.
<br><br>"It is only a moment away from being complete."
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch raised the corners of his mouth and said, "After the completion, it will be a huge cage that no one can escape from, and then once the teleportation formation is activated, it will be able to teleport these four guys directly to the Earth Palace killing formation."
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Perdition revealed an excited smile.
<br><br>"What's ridiculous is that these guys, dead to the world and still don't know it, actually still here waiting for the little red building to have fun, really don't even know how to die." The Genting kingdom monarch said with a face full of mockery.
<br><br>"Don't be too happy too early, until the last moment, no one knows what accidents will occur." The exterminator pressed his palm and reminded in a serious tone.
<br><br>But his own face, but directly smile.
<br><br>A moment later, a black shadow quietly arrived and nodded its head towards the two of them.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two looked at each other.
<br><br>With a raise of their palms, the crowd collectively withdrew from the formation.
<br><br>And outside the formation, the Cloud Top Empire mouthed an incantation and offered up a huge teleportation talisman in their hands.
<br><br>"Balalaalaalaalaalaala ......"
<br><br>After a burst of incantation, the teleportation formation blossomed into a dazzling light that suddenly enveloped the entire red building.
<br><br>"Keep singing, keep dancing!"
<br><br>In the room, just as Skeleton Benevolent drizzled liquor on his bones, feeling the cheerful atmosphere, and several others were also drunk, a pillar of light was cast, pulling them directly into it.
<br><br>"Aiyaaah, what's going on?"
<br><br>"Sister, where is the sister?"
<br><br>"Brother, it's so fast, I want to throw up."
<br><br>"Qing ah hold back."
<br><br>"My leg, I dropped a leg, brother yeah, help me look for it."
<br><br>"Bear big, bald head strong again to cut the tree!"
<br><br>Three demons a bone in a drunken state, at a very fast speed towards the cloud top underground palace killing array teleportation.
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha!"
<br><br>Seeing that the death was near, these four were still babbling nonsense, sarcastic laughter was transmitted from the Exterminator and the Genting Kingdom Monarch.
