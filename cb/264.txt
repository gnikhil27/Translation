Yi Feng just smiled.
<br><br>Because winning this old man was meaningless to him.
<br><br>Besides, it was an old man after all.
<br><br>It is still necessary to give some face.
<br><br>But looking at Yi Feng's mysterious and unpredictable smile, Ye Tian Sheng was even more puzzled.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In this game, he had a lot of insights, and even not a martial emperor, he also used this to really understand a trace of the power of the great dao.
<br><br>This chance.
<br><br>It is simply unbelievable.
<br><br>His future cultivation career will become smooth, without any bottleneck.
<br><br>"Alright old man, I should leave now." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and smiled at Ye Tian Sheng.
<br><br>What?
<br><br>Leave?
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng was truly dumbfounded.
<br><br>On the one hand, he destroyed the foundation of his Heavenly Sword Sect, and on the other hand, he gave him a chance, after this so contradictory practice, he wanted to leave without saying half a word, what the hell is the meaning of this ah?
<br><br>And.
<br><br>There is also the stone table that a game of chess tied, but also let him guess not half Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>"Oh yes, old man, here how to town on?"
<br><br>Yi Feng turned around and asked again.
<br><br>Although he did not know why Yi Feng asked such a question, Ye Tian Sheng still pointed out a way out for Yi Feng.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>Until Yi Feng disappeared, the doubts in his heart were still not solved.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng walked slowly along the path.
<br><br>Speaking of which, looking back on the previous days at the Heavenly Sword Gate, he still felt a little unbelievable.
<br><br>These walls, it's too mysterious.
<br><br>You say it's some kind of awesome formation, right? He's a mortal walking through it smoothly, and there's no danger.
<br><br>But you say it's really some kind of glass wall, it also makes Yi Feng feel far-fetched.
<br><br>Who's clan get so many glass walls, but also a fist on the broken, get to pose to see?
<br><br>Forget it.
<br><br>Do not want to.
<br><br>But Peng Ying, this dead woman, caught the opportunity to kill her ah!
<br><br>A plain at the foot of the Heavenly Sword Gate mountain.
<br><br>Numerous disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect gathered here, a gray head and face, full of wretchedness, many people looked at the collapse of the mountain gate, shedding tears of reluctance.
<br><br>On the side, the senior management of the Heavenly Sword Sect, led by Duan Qingfeng and others, was also red-eyed.
<br><br>The Heavenly Sword Sect, which had been inherited for countless years, was destroyed just like that, which was a heavy blow to all of them.
<br><br>But what was even more depressing was that they hadn't figured out what had happened until now.
<br><br>Just as Duan Qingfeng and the others were grieving, a disciple rushed in with an urgent voice.
<br><br>"It's not good, Sect Master."
<br><br>"The Heavenly Demon Sect, Wind and Cloud Valley, Blowing Snow Villa, Imperial Sword Sect, Li Family, and countless other clans are attacking."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng and the others' faces changed.
<br><br>When they looked up, they saw that countless figures were flying from afar, dense and black.
<br><br>And the leader of the group.
<br><br>It is the Royal Sword Sect Patriarch Yang Tianyu, the Wind Cloud Valley Patriarch Yun Haotian, the Li Family Patriarch Li Shuhua, the Snow Blower Villa Patriarch Fifth Tianming, the Devil's Voice Sect Patriarch Xue Qinzhu.
<br><br>And behind them, there are countless experts of several major sects.
<br><br>The combination of such a lineup, straight screaming people's scalps, countless Heavenly Sword Sect's disciples at this moment turned gloomy face.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>What in the world has his Heavenly Sword Sect done to make people angry?
<br><br>First, the mountain gate was destroyed, and now it was surrounded by several other top strengths of the Southern Sands.
<br><br>"Several people, what do you mean by this?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"What else does it mean?"
<br><br>In the sky, Yun Haotian snorted coldly and asked rhetorically, "What kind of treacherous thing has your Heavenly Sword Sect done, are you not clear in your own hearts?"
<br><br>"What kind of treacherous things, don't spit out blood!" Duan Qingfeng said with a cold face, "Are you trying to swallow my Heavenly Sword Sect by taking advantage of the danger of others?"
<br><br>"Do you really think that my Heavenly Sword Sect is easy to bully?"
<br><br>As soon as Duan Qingfeng's voice fell, hundreds of thousands of disciples of the entire Plain Heavenly Sword Sect drew their swords in unison, and the sound of swords was so loud that the sky was deafening.
<br><br>Seeing this, the experts of several major sects also revealed their weapons and their Yuan Qi rolled out.
<br><br>Under the majestic Yuan Qi envelope, the whole plain sky, wind and clouds surge.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The swords were drawn.
<br><br>"Your Heavenly Sword Sect really doesn't know what's good for you, you still don't repent even when you're dead!"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu sneered and said icily.
<br><br>"Not bad, your Heavenly Sword Sect's mountain gate has been destroyed, now you are still sophomoric, is it useful?"
<br><br>On the side, Yang Tianyu also came out and said.
<br><br>"Humph, advise your Heavenly Sword Sect, don't be stubborn, hurry up and surrender, or else the mountain gate is gone, not to mention that your entire Heavenly Sword Sect will be destroyed with it."
<br><br>The fifth Tianming also similarly sent out the last voice.
<br><br>Feeling the tone of these great sect leaders, Duan Qingfeng finally felt that something was wrong.
<br><br>Because according to them, their Heavenly Sword Sect had done something that the sky was angry with, and it was because of this matter that caused the Heavenly Sword Sect's mountain gate to be destroyed, while being besieged by several major sects.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>"Are you guys hiding something from me?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng's aura was revealed, and he immediately looked at the rest of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>"We don't know either, ah."
<br><br>"We really don't know, huh?"
<br><br>"Yes, Sect Master, if there was really such a thing, how could it be hidden from you?"
<br><br>Noticing Duan Qingfeng's gaze, the many elders of the Heavenly Sword Sect, including Peng Xian'er, emitted sorrowful voices and hurriedly explained.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>They were also confused.
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng took a deep breath, looked his gaze towards Yang Tianyu and the others, and cupped his fist, "Gentlemen, you know exactly what I, Duan Qingfeng, am, and I really don't understand what happened, so I hope you'll tell me what happened."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Fifth Tian Ming grimaced and coldly snorted, followed by a rolling sound.
<br><br>"Duan Qingfeng, whether you are pretending to be confused or really confused, but what we want to say is that you ask us, rather than ask ......"
<br><br>"The one next to you, good disciple!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, the fifth Tianming and other people's eyes, fiercely cast to Duan Qingfeng next to Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>PS: tomorrow to give you a small outbreak, seven or eight chapters of the way.
