However, just when everyone was looking at Yu Wujie enviously as he received the Martial Saint's inheritance, a change suddenly occurred.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>From Yu Wujie's mouth, a harsh, miserable scream suddenly came out.
<br><br>At the same time, his entire face became distorted, clearly suffering from this great pain.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>"This is not an inheritance, this is a body snatching!"
<br><br>In the crowd, someone immediately saw the clues and immediately shouted out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"It's actually a body snatching?"
<br><br>The crowd stared incredulously, and at the same time, their hearts instantly understood that this entire Jiang Yu tomb was a huge scam.
<br><br>This Jiang Yu is also not looking for any inheritor at all, but for a body snatcher. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Fear welled up in the hearts of the people.
<br><br>Fortunately, fortunately they are not the so-called inheritor, if not, now is taken by the body is their own bar.
<br><br>The change came so quickly, so that the crowd was out of expectation.
<br><br>"Holy Maiden, hurry up and leave this place, this person Jiang Yu is so sinister, perhaps there will be other hidden crises." Long Jiankong said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er nodded, and prepared to leave with Long Jiankong.
<br><br>The Fifth Longkong, as well as the other experts, also held the same thought and prepared to leave.
<br><br>As for Yu Wujie, there was no one who could control him now.
<br><br>But what the crowd didn't expect was that Jiang Yu suddenly waved his big hand, and an invisible barrier appeared around the graveyard, blocking the crowd's steps.
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>"Since you're here, why do you want to leave?"
<br><br>Jiang Yu snatched Yu Wujie while sneering, "This bureau, I set up for ten thousand years, in order to have today's effect, and I just happen to be short of sustenance for my emperor-breaking snatching, you guys will just happen to be the fertilizer for my emperor-breaking path!"
<br><br>As his voice fell, his palm reached up and opened towards one of the Heavenly Sword Sect elders.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Only to see him let out a miserable cry and was directly sucked into Jiang Yu's hand, then under the shocked gaze of the crowd, that elder aged at a visible speed, then became a dried corpse and was thrown to the ground.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, everyone's scalp was numb with fear, and a thick fear rose in their hearts.
<br><br>A Martial Dignity.
<br><br>It was actually sucked into a dry corpse in an instant.
<br><br>The eyes of Peng Xian'er's few people were even covered with blood, watching the elders under their sect being killed, but they could do nothing about it.
<br><br>"The power of the Martial Dignity is a bit weaker, but it will be able to last me for a while, don't worry guys, it will be your turn soon."
<br><br>Jiang Yu smiled coldly as his gaze swept over the bodies of several Martial Dignitaries in the field one by one.
<br><br>Instantly, these several Martial Dignitaries felt chills down their backs and cold sweat.
<br><br>Now the crowd, each and every one of them became a bird of prey, powerful strength at this moment instead became a life-threatening talisman, praying that they were the lowest in strength here.
<br><br>And look at Jiang Yu that can kill the martial daddy's means, the crowd also completely lost the courage to resist.
<br><br>It could be called a lamb to the slaughter!
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>From afar, the few people from Yun Xian Que, who were always watching the graveyard, suddenly stared incredulously.
<br><br>"It's actually true, a change has really occurred!"
<br><br>Especially Yang Mu's few people were shocked beyond measure.
<br><br>At the same time, the heart, also full of fear and thankful, if they also went, then is not like those people in general, become that Jiang Yu anvil of fish meat?
<br><br>"Miss, Lu Qingshan really said right again!"
<br><br>After a long time, Yang Mu said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>"Yes, he's right again."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was also full of emotion.
<br><br>"Miss, we two apologize for our mistrust of you before, fortunately Miss called us, otherwise ......"
<br><br>Looking at the scene that happened in the cemetery, Yang Mu two people could not help but feel emotion.
<br><br>"You are all my relatives, how could I possibly watch something happen to you." Yun Xian Que said with a smile, "Just what makes me even more curious is that the big man that Lu Qingshan said, in the end, what is he?"
<br><br>"Yes, even Jiang Yu's conspiracy he has long seen through, that means his strength is unfathomable!" Yang Mu lamented.
<br><br>"Alas, it's just that Lu Qingshan warned me not to presume to pry into that senior, I'm afraid I won't be able to see him."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que shook his head, full of loss.
<br><br>The more accurate that person's prophecy was, the more terrifying his strength would be, so now for Lu Qingshan's caution, she couldn't disregard it even more.
<br><br>"What do we do now Miss, do we just watch them die?" Yang Sen asked.
<br><br>"The elders of the Heavenly Sword Sect are only killed in seconds, what's the use of us going, but let's inform this news as soon as possible, it's better to tell Lu Qingshan first, if Lu Qingshan goes to that senior, the matter might still have some chance to turn around."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que said.
<br><br>Yang Mu two people nodded their heads.
<br><br>Then several people quickly rushed towards the Qingshan Gate.
<br><br>"Another sustenance, how nice!"
<br><br>And after that elder from the Heavenly Sword Sect, another Martial Exalted Elder from the Blowing Snow Villa also stepped into the dust.
<br><br>"What to do, think of something!"
<br><br>"Yes, I don't want to die!"
<br><br>"I'm just here for treasure hunting, I don't want to become a dry corpse!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu's taboo, waiting for death in the crowd of people have come out wailing, face is even full of despair.
<br><br>"Yes, we must gather together to think of a solution, otherwise we will all die for sure!" Fifth Longkong shouted anxiously.
<br><br>"It's useless!"
<br><br>The fifth formation shook his head with a face full of death and said, "His ambition is to break the emperor, although I don't know what form he exists in now, but at this moment his strength is invincible under the Martial Emperor, not to mention us, I'm afraid that even the Martial Saints have no power to resist."
<br><br>At these words, the crowd looked even more desperate.
<br><br>"It's almost time to pick sustenance again, whose turn should it be now?" While Jiang Yu seized Yu Wujie, his gaze crossed over the only remaining Martial Saints in the field one by one.
<br><br>Finally, he landed on Shu Qinhua's body.
<br><br>"The first genius of the young generation in Nansha, shouldn't let me down!"
<br><br>Shu Qinhua's face changed greatly, but as Jiang Yu's palm rose, she arrived in front of Jiang Yu without the slightest resistance.
<br><br>The life-threatening palm suddenly appeared above her head.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>Book Qinhua felt that the cultivation and vitality of her body was rapidly draining away.
<br><br>Was it going to die?
<br><br>Her expression was filled with resignation.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>But suddenly, an unbelievable shout came out of Jiang Yu's mouth, and Shu Qinhua, who was expected to die for sure, was thrown out.
<br><br>Also at the same time, Jiang Yu stopped for Wu Jie's seizure and shouted like crazy: "No, no, it's not like this, how could it be like this?"
<br><br>While roaring, he fiercely turned his gaze towards Yu Wujie, grabbed his neck and asked with a trembling voice: "I ask you, are you the one who composed the zither score or not?"
<br><br>"Ooooooooo ......"
<br><br>After stopping the seizure, Yu Wujie was finally able to speak, cried out violently, and shouted like a madman: "Spare me spare me, master please spare me!"
<br><br>"I'm asking you a question!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu growled with red eyes.
<br><br>"Oooh, I'm not, I'm not, the zither score was not composed by me at all."
<br><br>In order to save his life, Yu Wujie at this moment where still dare to hide, with a crying voice urgently shouted: "Not only the music is not my composition, even that what heaven and earth door also does not care about me ah, it is its own open, and I came here is also brought here by force, not my business ah, please forgive me ...... ......"
<br><br>Yu Wujie has long since become incoherent.
<br><br>Under the absolute fear, the urine and stool have also long been scared out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The zither score was actually not written by him?"
<br><br>"Even the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Gate was not opened by him?"
<br><br>When the crowd heard Yu Wujie's voice, they revealed an unbelievable look.
<br><br>"I thought I had looked away, but it turns out to be a waste!" Peng Xian'er said with a face full of contempt.
<br><br>At the same time, the others were also full of disdain for Wu Jie.
<br><br>They thought it was a person, and they felt more or less sorry for being taken over by Jiang Yu like this, but they didn't expect it to be such a piece of trash!
<br><br>"It's really not you!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu emitted a monstrous flame and grabbed Yu Wujie while stepping on the imperial lyre platform with his paws, and sullenly bellowed, "Take me to him."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>With a handful of snot and tears, Yu Wujie did not dare to question in the slightest and hurriedly agreed.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>Jiang Yu stepped on the Emperor's Piano Platform and flew towards Pingjiang City with a monstrous aura.
<br><br>And after he left, the taboo that imprisoned the crowd also dissipated.
<br><br>For a while, many experts fled like crazy.
<br><br>And as Shu Qinhua looked at the place where Jiang Yu was going, she took a pill and followed him.
<br><br>"Let's go take a look too, it should be fine to keep a distance." The fifth formation grabbed the fifth long air and similarly swept towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er watched a number of experts rush off, and Long Jiankong looked at each other and followed suit.
