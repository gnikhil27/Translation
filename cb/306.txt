Yi Feng and others, is already on the way back to the journey.
<br><br>On the way to stop, after almost a month, finally is back to the South Sand border.
<br><br>Only now it was much more boring than when they came.
<br><br>"Alas, I don't know what that group of old men have been doing, I hope the troublesome things in old man Wu's family have been solved!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed.
<br><br>But just as he was about to continue his journey, he found a group of people blocking their way in the middle of the mountain forest ahead.
<br><br>These people were fierce and fierce-looking, and at a glance, they knew they were not good people.
<br><br>Sure enough, the leader of the one-eyed dragon came out with a threatening voice, and drank in a deep voice: "A few little guys, if you have the sense to call out all the things on your body, or you will die here."
<br><br>"It's over, touching the mountain bandits."
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart secretly said bad, full of gloomy face, for a moment do not know how to do.
<br><br>Although the time to come also encountered mountain bandits, but they are at least more people ah, even if the old man Wang kind of old arms and legs, but also able to help him hold back one or two. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>What's more, they came across Li Yihan the heroine on the way here.
<br><br>But now he took the skeleton Ben Wei and Zhong Qing, facing so many people is undoubtedly two fists can not beat four hands ah. Plus this kind of deserted place, want to call for help is also very difficult.
<br><br>But ask him to hand over all his belongings, is undoubtedly more difficult for him.
<br><br>He does not want to go back to continue to eat dirt.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>Now the situation is very bad.
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng was in a dilemma and didn't know what to do, an abrupt voice suddenly came from behind.
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha, goodness gracious."
<br><br>Yi Feng turned around and saw a monk with a face full of greatness and a righteous aura walking over.
<br><br>"Oh, Master Kun Peng?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Master, we really have a destiny to meet again." Monk Kunpeng smiled gently.
<br><br>"Yes, it's really destiny." Yi Feng hurriedly said, but saw the redness on Monk Kunpeng's neck, and couldn't help but ask, "Master Kunpeng, your neck, what's wrong with it?"
<br><br>"No need to be alarmed, monk, there are inevitably some bee and butterfly stings on the way." Monk Kunpeng smiled lightly and said.
<br><br>"Bees and butterflies?"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but open another glance, could not help but ask: "really bees and butterflies, always feel not quite like ah!"
<br><br>"Monks do not deceive."
<br><br>Monk Kun Peng laughed plainly.
<br><br>"Also."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, and right now this is not the time to dwell on this, the important thing is what to do with the mountain bandits in front of you.
<br><br>Can't help but, he turned his gaze to Monk Kunpeng and asked, "Master Kunpeng, these mountain bandits are blocking the road, do you have any solutions to solve them?"
<br><br>"Master Shih doesn't need to worry much, let me convince them." Monk Kunpeng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Probation them?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised.
<br><br>"People are good by nature, believe that I can do it."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng nodded gently, then folded his hands and walked towards the group of mountain bandits under Yi Feng's gaze.
<br><br>He then led them into the dense forest.
<br><br>But a moment's work, monk Kunpeng again hands together, all righteousness out of the dense forest.
<br><br>And behind him, there was no longer any trace of the mountain bandits.
<br><br>"Master Kunpeng, you this ......" Yi Feng hurriedly welcomed him and asked.
<br><br>"The monk can rest assured, they are all finished with my probation, Amitabha Buddha." Monk Kunpeng smiled lightly and said.
<br><br>"Is it really that powerful?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of incredulity, this group of mountain bandits are people who lick blood from the mouth of a sword, just for a while they were really probationed?
<br><br>Thinking of this, he cautiously asked, "Master Kunpeng, you won't kill them, will you?"
<br><br>"Huh, heaven has the virtue of good life, how can a monk talk about killing?"
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng hastily shook his head and cautioned.
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly stunned and reacted with slight shame, "Rather, I was abrupt."
<br><br>"Well monk, poor monk will leave now, see you again if there is a chance." Monk Kunpeng smiled and was just about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and said, "By the way, monk, don't forget about the poor monk."
<br><br>Although he didn't know why Kunpeng said that, Yi Feng said, "Naturally, I will not forget Master."
<br><br>"Many thanks, Master."
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha."
<br><br>After saying that, he bowed slightly with his hands together toward Yi Feng and left with a pair of imperceptible bloody footprints.
<br><br>"Master Kunpeng take care."
<br><br>Yi Feng also said with folded hands, smiling as he sent the monk off.
<br><br>After the monk left, Yi Feng took out the map and struggled with which way to go home.
<br><br>Because this place is far from Pingjiang City, this is only a long way to go to encounter the bandits, the subsequent road is not guaranteed to encounter.
<br><br>But look at the map shows, back to Pingjiang City on this one road.
<br><br>When Yi Feng did not know what to do, his eyes suddenly lit up: "Hey, here is the 100,000 big mountains ......"
<br><br>Although walking inside this mountain will take a lot of detours, but at least not encounter bandits ah!
<br><br>And he himself has had many experiences in the Shogun Mountain Range, and has complete survival experience inside the mountain.
<br><br>The most important.
<br><br>There is enough game inside the mountain to eat all the way through.
<br><br>Although his storage ring, there are still a lot of stored in the Makufu Mountain Range to get the game, but by now has long been fresh.
<br><br>What's more, his apprentice brother's worries he also remembered it.
<br><br>If you go to the mountains, in case you come across a wild yak or two, you can also get a couple of bullwhip, to make up for your apprentice, he can also make up for it along with it.
<br><br>Get.
<br><br>A lot of gains.
<br><br>A slap on the thigh.
<br><br>Yi Feng directly abandoned the carriage, changing direction towards the hundred thousand mountains.
