Then it was seen, Yi Feng grabbed the skeleton Ben Wei's black robe and pressed it to the bottom of his foot, kicking it one by one.
<br><br>"Ooooooooo ......"
<br><br>"Master, I was wrong, I was wrong, I dare not again."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei did not have that leisurely look just now at all, hugging Yi Feng's thighs, emitting a crying voice.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It simply petrified the two people of Desolation Free Trail.
<br><br>Is this still the black-robed man who gently and gently cured Shui Xing into submission?
<br><br>This is actually so humble in front of Yi Feng?
<br><br>That Yi Feng?
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>At the thought of this, Desolate Wujing felt his heart and soul tremble! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In order to confirm the speculation in his heart, he could no longer hold his breath and finally gathered the courage to walk towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Old ......"
<br><br>He wiggled his lips and found himself somewhat afraid to continue to call Yi Feng old brother.
<br><br>Yi Feng instead, after kicking Bone Ben Wei to the ground, asked with a gentle smile, "Older brother, do you have something to do?"
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Desolate WuJi did not know how to speak, under the apprehension in his heart, took out the small wooden sculpture that Yi Feng gave him and asked, "I want to ask you, this wooden sculpture, where exactly did you get it from?"
<br><br>"Old brother look at your memory, did not I say I carved it myself?" Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>Desolate Wujian's heart jolted.
<br><br>Although Yi Feng did tell him that he had carved it himself before, he thought it was a casual remark made by Yi Feng, so he didn't take it to heart at all.
<br><br>But at this moment, Yi Feng once again admitted that this wooden carving was carved by him, so he had to consider the authenticity of it.
<br><br>But, he was still a little unbelievable.
<br><br>This youth, who had spent so many days with him and seemed extremely gentle, was really a supreme master?
<br><br>"What's wrong old brother, is there something wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng casually took the small wooden sculpture in Desolate Wuji's hand, and then suddenly realized, "It actually cracked, then old brother is really sorry."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked quite embarrassed.
<br><br>This wood carving was carved when he first learned carving, the materials and techniques used were not very good.
<br><br>"This way old brother, I'll re-send you a few." Yi Feng said as he casually threw that big baby on the ground.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This light-hearted statement of Yi Feng instantly stunned Desolate Wuji.
<br><br>"You ...... you you still have?"
<br><br>He said with a red neck.
<br><br>"Of course there is, it's not a rare thing, I have six more here, together with the one you gave before, it's the matching one."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng felt from his arms, all the other several gourd children touched out, cupped in his hand towards the deserted pathless handed over, smiled: "Come, old brother, all for you."
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Desolate pathless breathing has become rapid, reaching palms are straight shivering.
<br><br>Eyes looking at this handful of gourd children in Yi Feng's hand, feel extremely unbelievable. Such a powerful thing, actually took out so much with his hands?
<br><br>Simply too terrifying.
<br><br>And this moment, he also completely confirmed the identity of Yi Feng expert.
<br><br>Because a gourd child may be Yi Feng accidentally from somewhere, but it is always impossible that so many gourd children are unintentionally obtained by him.
<br><br>Can't help but, he was filled with a bitter smile.
<br><br>He has been reluctant to reveal his identity in front of Yi Feng, afraid that his identity scared Yi Feng, but damn it now, it seems to be completely not so ah!
<br><br>It turns out that in the relationship between the two, he Desolate Wuji is the little old brother ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng is the one who is afraid to tell his identity, will scare his big brother ah.
<br><br>Once he thought of this, Desolate Wuji's face turned red, feeling that he was groundless in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>What is even more ridiculous is that he also sent a jade pendant to Yi Feng to save his life, not knowing that Yi Feng casually took out the same thing, can save his Desolate WuJiai's life.
<br><br>And looking back, Yi Feng at that time this chaotic land as a tourist attraction, he still think Yi Feng quite naive and ignorant.
<br><br>But according to all the means Yi Feng now seems, this what chaotic land, in his eyes, is not a tourist attraction!
<br><br>"Before ...... before, senior, it's all my fault Desolate WuJing has eyes without pearls, before if there are offenses, also to atone ah!" Desolate no path apprehensively bowed down, said in awe.
<br><br>"What are you doing, old brother?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly helped Desolate Wujing up and said with a stern face, "Why are you suddenly calling me senior, although I also think my carving skills are really good, but our relationship is like this because of a carving, you are not too out of touch, right?"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's appearance, Desolate Pathless froze, his heart moved to the extreme.
<br><br>"Old brother, I rarely make you such a good friend, if you become like this because of this little carving technique of mine, if I had known this I would not have sent you gourd children." Yi Feng said with a stern face.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Desolate Wujiu's heart was even more moved.
<br><br>However, he also immediately understood in his heart, Yi Feng at this moment to look at his psychology, and at that time he first looked at Yi Feng's psychology is exactly the same.
<br><br>After all, masters are lonely!
<br><br>Usually used to being complimented, it's not easy to come across a person you can befriend on rare occasions.
<br><br>Of course, except now he was the one who was interesting in Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji sighed in his heart.
<br><br>It seems that Yi Feng does not want to pick up on all this, in that case, he Desolate Wuji will not pick up on it either.
<br><br>He could only cooperate with Yi Feng and continue to be this interesting person!
<br><br>After all, to be able to make friends with such a person is a blessing that he, Desolate Wuji, cultivated in his previous life!
<br><br>"This girl, you're not doing anything right?"
<br><br>And at this time, Yi Feng came to Shui Xing's front, picked up Shui Xing and said softly.
<br><br>"I, I I'm fine."
<br><br>Shui Xing revealed a flattered look and responded in a panic.
<br><br>After all, she had just seen this youth with her own eyes, stomping on that black-robed man who made her feel terrified.
<br><br>What does this mean?
<br><br>It means that this one in front of her is an existence that is even more terrifying than the black-robed man.
<br><br>It can be said that this kind of existence is completely afraid for her to imagine.
<br><br>She glanced at Desolate Wuji, with a strong jealousy in her eyes. Jealous that Desolate Wuji had actually hooked up with this kind of character.
<br><br>She knew that even if her current cultivation level was stronger than Desolate Wujing, she would never be able to fight Desolate Wujing.
<br><br>"Girl, next time don't wander around, you only ran into me, if it was anyone else, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to leave today!" Yi Feng said in a serious tone towards Shui Xing.
<br><br>After all, his words are not without reason.
<br><br>Such a beautiful girl, in this kind of place where there is no village, it is difficult not to let people have non-thought, but where there is some evil intention, afraid to fall a body crippled membrane broken end.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's words, but the water line shuddered.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words of warning, full ah!
