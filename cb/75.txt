"Bright card."
<br><br>"Super double."
<br><br>"Four deuces."
<br><br>"King bomb!"
<br><br>"Straight closes."
<br><br>"Ha!"
<br><br>Slamming the cards in his hand on the table, Yi Feng showed a happy smile, a night passed, he did not know how many springs to play two people, really two little trash ah!
<br><br>Seeing another spring, the faces of the two women became more and more ugly.
<br><br>At this rate, the two not only can not win, the only treasure in hand, I'm afraid also have to lose out, is simply a stolen chicken is not a rice!
<br><br>To add insult to injury, outside the rooster has already crowed, said tomorrow will soon be light.
<br><br>For a time, the two women's faces anxious color more and more prevailing, just at this time, Yi Feng stretched, got up and said: "I'm convenient, come back later." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng walked out of the room.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Mao Yun'er red lips bit, looked at Demon Ling'er and asked softly, "What should we do?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er frowned and thought deeply.
<br><br>Then she raised her jade hand and a red porcelain bottle was taken out.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er opened slightly, and then also took out a white jade bottle similarly.
<br><br>Both sides coincidentally looked at each other, also did not expect the two have made the same preparation, there is an indescribable complex in the heart.
<br><br>"So ...... use your or use mine?"
<br><br>Finally, Mao Yuner tightly bite red lips said.
<br><br>"Use it together!"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er pondered slightly, although her Heavenly Fragrance Scatter cultivator is also not immune, but Yi Feng is not some ordinary cultivator, so to be on the safe side ......
<br><br>She bite her shell teeth.
<br><br>Bring the kettle next to her, and pour all the medicine inside the two bottles in.
<br><br>"Back."
<br><br>And after the drugs were poured, Yi Feng just rushed back to sit down again and looked at the poker in front of him and said, "It's almost dawn, I'm so tired, how about this evening?"
<br><br>Saying that, he put away Mao Yun'er's copper piece and the demon spirit's double blade.
<br><br>"Then I'll laugh at this thing?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the two women's faces looked anxious and stretched out their palms and wanted to take them back.
<br><br>"Willing to bet, why not?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a joke.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's joking words sounded like a question to the two women, like a mockery. The two women drew back their palms at the same time, forced a smile, and said stiffly: "No ...... no no, since we lost, we are definitely willing to bet and accept defeat."
<br><br>"That's right, just a little something, next time you win back is."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and put the two items into his arms.
<br><br>It's not that he wanted these two things, just playing cards, since there is this lottery, you certainly can not break this rule, otherwise the next time you play, there is no kind of let people take it seriously.
<br><br>"You're right."
<br><br>The two women nodded their heads, but the smile on their faces was worse than crying.
<br><br>It was almost as if blood was dripping from their hearts.
<br><br>However, the good thing is that it is not without final preparation.
<br><br>As long as the final success, after that what, pampering and then rub a little may be able to give things to ask back, and perhaps get other good things.
<br><br>With the same mind, the two women looked at each other, smiling towards Yi Feng said: "Mr. played a night of cards, have not had a few mouthfuls of water, drink some water first, sit here to rest and relax!"
<br><br>Saying that, the two women poured a glass of water for Yi Feng.
<br><br>"No need to be so polite, you guys didn't drink water either!" Yi Feng smiled, took the water bottle, also poured a cup for the two, "You guys drink too!"
<br><br>When the two women saw this, their hearts thumped, and their faces looked ugly to the extreme.
<br><br>"It's just a drink of water, why so nervous?" Yi Feng asked suspiciously.
<br><br>"No, no."
<br><br>The two women explained in unison, afraid that Yi Feng could see what, after glancing at each other both made a decision, and then picked up the water cup.
<br><br>Perhaps they drink after the performance, can be more pleasing to this one it.
<br><br>This thought, the two people also no longer heart pressure, and then and Yi Feng finished the cup of water, their hearts only a sigh of relief.
<br><br>The thing, already half successful.
<br><br>Just need to delay for a few moments, when the effect of the medicine will take effect, it will be a great success.
<br><br>I can't help but, demon Ling'er and Mao Yun'er have a chat with Yi Feng, I don't know, they gradually feel the strength of the medicine began to come up, the body gradually then some fever.
<br><br>And Yi Feng also seems to ......
<br><br>"Aiya, how suddenly a little hot?" Yi Feng fanned with his hand, feeling a little puzzled.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The two women's hearts were happy, only the last step was missing.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly touched his stomach again and said with a frown, "Why is my stomach uncomfortable again, you guys wait a moment, I'll go to the toilet again."
<br><br>At that, the two women's faces were anxious, but Yi Feng had already gone out.
