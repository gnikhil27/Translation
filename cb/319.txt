But however.
<br><br>What the Void did not expect was that in the face of this lightning-like attack from Black Kui, Yi Feng actually tilted his head and dodged it while grabbing Black Kui in his hand.
<br><br>"Yah."
<br><br>"What a big snake."
<br><br>Yi Feng grabbed Black Kui with one hand, while exclaiming.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>But when he saw this scene, the shadow shivered and his eyes stared straight up.
<br><br>How could it be?
<br><br>How could it be?
<br><br>Not only did this inferior human from the lower realms dodge Black Kui's attack, but he actually grabbed Black Kui?
<br><br>This caused a shocking wave to rise in his mind. 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>You know, even the immortals of the immortal world have also fallen under the mouth of the black kyu, ordinary immortals are unable to dodge the attack, but actually dodged by the white-robed man in front of him?
<br><br>How can he not feel shocked and appalled?
<br><br>But Yi Feng next that cold sentence, instantly let the shadow like a lightning strike.
<br><br>"Recently the mouth is almost faded a bird, this snake looks to have a few taels of meat, just can improve to improve the food."
<br><br>Yi Feng said excitedly.
<br><br>After saying.
<br><br>Yi Feng palm fiercely flung, Black Kui's head flung on the ground, immediately fainted.
<br><br>And the shadow hidden in the shadows clearly felt that Black Kui's aura disappeared and the connection with him was gone.
<br><br>The right-hand man who had followed him for countless years ......
<br><br>Just like that, it's gone?
<br><br>Void panic, Yi Feng took out another pot and a bowl from within the storage ring.
<br><br>Then under his eyes, Yi Feng will pot directly mixed with good water, set up the storage ring within the standing some firewood and began to make a fire.
<br><br>And because there is no knife on his body, so Yi Feng will be one of the bowls broken, with a sharp tile began to clean up the black kui.
<br><br>Peel the skin and cut the meat finally to the pot, in one fell swoop.
<br><br>A look is an old hand.
<br><br>Add some seasoning, soon, the pot has been a faint fragrance.
<br><br>When Yi Feng felt it was almost time, he took the pot ladle out and filled a large bowl.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"This soup is really fresh ah!"
<br><br>"Simply don't be too comfortable, soothing all over!"
<br><br>Yi Feng had a satisfied face.
<br><br>Watching the black kyu that has followed him for countless years become someone else's plate of food, the shadow heart is dripping blood, but even so, he shrank inside the corner is not even dare to move.
<br><br>He has lived for countless years, now where can not see that the white-robed man in front of him is a super old monster.
<br><br>Otherwise.
<br><br>How could he ignore the Immortal level taboo?
<br><br>And how could he easily dodge Black Kui's attacks and even use Black Kui as a ration?
<br><br>It turned out that it wasn't his dimensionality reduction suppression that was the problem at all.
<br><br>Rather, his dimensional suppression was simply ineffective against this person in front of him.
<br><br>At the thought of this, the Void Shadow was on the verge of tears.
<br><br>His heart was filled with depression.
<br><br>He just wanted to catch a talented descendant here to take a new life, but never thought he would attract such an old monster!
<br><br>As for how to attract such an old monster, what is the purpose of this old monster to come here, he does not know at all.
<br><br>Also dare not say, much less dare not ask.
<br><br>He could only shrink in the corner and conceal his whole soul aura to the extreme, hoping in his heart that this old monster did not find him.
<br><br>"One more bowl!"
<br><br>Yi Feng ate unhurriedly.
<br><br>Finished eating a bowl.
<br><br>Dried up another bowl.
<br><br>"Spaced ......"
<br><br>After burping, Yi Feng took out a few more fresh fruits from inside his storage ring that he had collected earlier and hadn't finished eating, as an after-dinner fruit.
<br><br>A few fruits down, Yi Feng's face was even more satisfied.
<br><br>"Comfortable ah!"
<br><br>"So tired, let's take a nap first!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched his back, covered that pot with a lid, then leaned against a wall and took a big nap.
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"Grandpa, you don't sleep, hurry up, you don't mess with me like that!"
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng actually still sleeping, shrinking in the corner not even dare to move the shadow of the eyes are about to tears down.
<br><br>He has obviously experienced countless years, but now stay in front of this old monster, feel every moment is so long.
<br><br>Time passed slowly.
<br><br>Just when the void spirit was about to collapse, Yi Feng finally squinted his eyes and stood up.
<br><br>"Ouch, too much soup."
<br><br>Yi Feng murmured with a face full of depression.
<br><br>After taking a look, seeing no one around he directly unbuckled his trouser belt and then walked towards a side corner.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the void in the corner straightened up with cold air.
<br><br>This old monster.
<br><br>It actually walked towards him.
<br><br>What is he going to do, has he found me, is he going to finish me off?
<br><br>His heart and soul trembled.
<br><br>Finally, a bubble of urine nourished down.
<br><br>Woo ......
<br><br>Don't.
<br><br>Do not ah.
<br><br>Grand Master.
<br><br>I was wrong.
<br><br>I will never dare to take over you again.
<br><br>Void body straight smoke, heart roar constantly, and the whole soul body than before more transparent, apparently the soul more suffered heavy trauma.
<br><br>After spilling.
<br><br>Yi Feng shivered and walked back to the pot.
<br><br>Looking at there is still a small half pot of snake soup, and began to slowly and leisurely drink up.
<br><br>A mouthful of soup.
<br><br>A mouthful of meat.
<br><br>A full hour, Yi Feng was satisfied to put away the pot, stood in place and stretched a lazy back.
<br><br>And in the corner of the moribund shadow, is staring at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Big brother.
<br><br>You soup finished, pissed, you can always leave, right?
<br><br>But what he did not expect was that Yi Feng had no intention of leaving at all, but slowly and leisurely wandered around the hall.
<br><br>Woo.
<br><br>My goodness.
<br><br>How long are you going to torture me!
<br><br>Please.
<br><br>My black kyu is eaten by you only a snake head, why you still do not leave?
<br><br>"Alas, such a big hall, why can't I find a suitable weapon?"
<br><br>Turned around.
<br><br>Looking at the empty hall, Yi Feng frowned, could not help but spit: "Damn give me a mouthful of bricks for self-defense or ah!"
<br><br>And the shivering shadow in the corner heard Yi Feng's voice and shivered.
<br><br>This one's words.
<br><br>Meaning ah!
