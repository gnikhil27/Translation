Nansha is huge.
<br><br>The prosperous places are very prosperous, the remote places are also very remote, and because of the vast territory, the cities are almost always far apart from each other.
<br><br>The good thing is, the scenery along the way is also extremely beautiful.
<br><br>At least Yi Feng saw along the way, a lot of scenery that could not be seen in his previous life.
<br><br>"Sir, I ......"
<br><br>At this time, Wu Yonghong came, swallowed and said: "just received news, I have some trouble at home need to go back to solve, and because of the relatively troublesome reason, so I also want to borrow a few people to go together to help, I hope that sir grace."
<br><br>Hearing this, Master Wang and other people heard the news also came over.
<br><br>"Oh, what happened inside your house?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly asked, and knew in his heart that Wu Yonghong was indeed not from Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"A little trouble, it's a long story, so I won't bother you." Wu Yonghong hurriedly said, "I only hope that sir and all of you can grant permission."
<br><br>"There is no such thing as permission or not, hurry up and go back to solve things!" Yi Feng hurriedly said: "As for you say you want them a few also go to help, I naturally will not have any opinion, only need their own consent on the line." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng will look at the old man Wang and other people.
<br><br>"We are all old friends in this group, friends in trouble, it is right to help." Grand Master Wang said with a smile.
<br><br>"As long as sir is okay with it, I naturally won't have any problems."
<br><br>"Yes, we are all old friends."
<br><br>In a moment, the others also took a stand.
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Yonghong immediately showed his gratitude and bowed towards the crowd.
<br><br>"Thank you sir, thank you all!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng added: "Old Wu, you don't have to be so polite, if it's really troublesome over there, if it's useful to me, you can also say so."
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong was grateful, and the worries that had covered his face dissipated a lot.
<br><br>For him, Yi Feng's words, is an absolute guarantee.
<br><br>After a little packing, Wu Yonghong took Pork Rong, old man Wang and Lu Dasheng and others on the trip.
<br><br>And after the people left, Yi Feng found extraordinarily cold, he was left with skeleton Ben Wei and the dog.
<br><br>But it is good, less people also have the advantage of less people.
<br><br>After a slight rest, one person, one bone and one dog, re-embarked on a spring trip.
<br><br>When rushed to the next city, Yi Feng is already hungry and starving.
<br><br>To add insult to injury, the city is very small, Yi Feng searched for most of the day before finding a restaurant.
<br><br>But walk in to take a look, but found that has long been overcrowded, there is no spare position.
<br><br>This is really worried about Yi Feng.
<br><br>You say to the next restaurant if there is not yet to say, here waiting for a table, do not know to wait until the year of monkeys and horses.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng did find the table by the window on the second floor, only one person was eating.
<br><br>That is a middle-aged man, dressed elegantly, full of red face.
<br><br>At the same time, behind him stood a man in black, as if he was an escort, and it was clear that this man had some identity.
<br><br>Slightly hesitant, Yi Feng walked over there.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng walking over, the black-clothed guard took a step forward and was about to intercept Yi Feng.
<br><br>But the middle-aged man waved his hand and said, "Stand down."
<br><br>After saying that, he turned his gaze to Yi Feng and poked around with interest.
<br><br>He was curious as to what this young man was doing as he walked over.
<br><br>Under his prying gaze, Yi Feng smiled, clasped his fist and asked, "This man, I'm really a bit hungry, but I'm suffering from the lack of empty seats, so is it convenient to share a table with you?"
<br><br>The middle-aged man who sized up Yi Feng raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>The corners of his mouth couldn't help but raise.
<br><br>Share a table?
<br><br>This mortal in front of him is a bit interesting, it seems no one has ever dared to sit across from him to eat!
<br><br>"Sit."
<br><br>He unexpectedly extended his hand.
<br><br>Good man.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart is happy, towards the middle-aged man hugged a fist, and sat down on his butt.
<br><br>Seeing this, the black-clothed guard's face was slightly cold.
<br><br>But the middle-aged man did not say anything, he naturally did not dare to act rashly.
<br><br>Soon, a few dishes were served on the table.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not say a word, move chopsticks to eat, a few bites of food down Yi Feng feel satisfied.
<br><br>Then a sip of wine, it will be more satisfied.
<br><br>Immediately ordered a pot of wine, but a sip down, but extremely difficult to drink.
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng did not know what to do, but found the middle-aged man next to a small, delicate bottle, the bottle exudes a faint fragrance.
<br><br>This caused Yi Feng's eyes to light up.
<br><br>"Uh, old brother, this wine of yours, can I have some, the wine in this restaurant is really too hard to drink." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>The moment these words fell, it immediately caused a cold light to flash in the eyes of that black-clothed guard.
<br><br>This person, how dare he!
<br><br>And the middle-aged man was also greatly surprised.
<br><br>The middle-aged man was also surprised.
