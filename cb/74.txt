"Sir this?"
<br><br>The two women cast a puzzled look.
<br><br>"A landlord!"
<br><br>"This ...... this is a landlord?"
<br><br>"What else?"
<br><br>The two women's pretty bodies trembled.
<br><br>Fiercely stunned in place, an expression of doubt about life surged on their faces.
<br><br>After reacting, embarrassed beyond belief, the corners of their mouths twitched, and only then did they understand that the two of them had been misunderstanding the meaning of a landlord.
<br><br>"What to do?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er blinked at the demon spirit child, after all, the two of them now have one glory and one loss.
<br><br>"First accompany sir, fight ...... landlord!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Demon Ling'er heart is full of complexity, clenched his teeth and said, the other things can only find another opportunity, after all, have been three people a room, there will always be opportunities.
<br><br>Yi Feng quickly taught the rules of landlord fighting to the two women.
<br><br>"There are no more questions, right?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"No, no problem."
<br><br>The two women had a lot of complications in their hearts, but they could only nod their heads.
<br><br>"But, just dry fighting, no point in not having some stakes." Yi Feng stroked his chin and said, "This way, we each take out one thing as a bet, and finally look at the final tally, whoever has more points, wins."
<br><br>"Of course, small bets are good for the soul big bets hurt."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng slapped a dagger on the table, "so the bet better be somewhat valuable, and not too expensive, I'll take this dagger of mine, it's one of my favorite!"
<br><br>However, when Yi Feng's dagger was slapped on the table, Demon Ling'er's eyes went straight.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>This was the one, the so-called somewhat valuable, but not too expensive item?
<br><br>Demon Ling'er drew back a breath of cold air, this dagger she could not recognize the exact quality at all, but she knew that it was at least something of holy quality.
<br><br>This instantly made her salivate.
<br><br>However, once she remembered that she simply didn't have anything of this grade to compare with on her own, she was in a quandary.
<br><br>After hesitating for a long, long time, she fished out her twin swords that Ning Xuanwu had bestowed on her from her storage ring, which were of the same grade as the Heaven-shaking Stone.
<br><br>Of course, this was also the most valuable thing she could only take out, and even the most valuable thing in the Xuanwu Sect at the moment.
<br><br>"Sir, is it okay if I use this, as a bet?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er asked nervously, fearing in her heart that Yi Feng would look down on these two swords and would not be willing.
<br><br>"Just about right."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, after all, this pair of swords also looked quite exquisite, and did meet his condition of not too bad and not too expensive.
<br><br>Yi Feng's agreement made Demon Ling'er breathe a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Her heart began to boil with enthusiasm at the thought that she could use her twin swords to win Yi Feng's dagger that was no less than a holy item.
<br><br>On the other hand, Mao Yun'er looked at Yi Feng's dagger and Demon Ling'er's twin swords and was torn.
<br><br>As the Pearl of the Chamber of Commerce, she grew up with eyesight that was not comparable to ordinary people.
<br><br>Can see that the two things are not ordinary things, if she is taking out too inferior things certainly not, but with the things that are not much different, he has only ......
<br><br>Gritted her teeth, she took out a bronze piece sculpted with a flower pattern in her arms, placed it on the table, and asked softly, "I use this, is it okay?"
<br><br>Yi Feng knocked a glance and nodded his head, naturally there was no problem.
<br><br>But Demon Ling'er's eyes jumped, some surprise looked at Mao Yun'er, this piece of copper, seems to be one of the keys to a certain secret realm ah, also did not expect Mao Yun'er actually able to take out such things.
<br><br>But think about it, as a big chamber of commerce, there are some good things or justifiable, after all, they cultivators will often go to the mortal chamber of commerce Taobao it.
<br><br>This is even better.
<br><br>If you can really win, not only can you win that not less than the sacred artifacts, but also get the secret key, this trip even if you really can not achieve the purpose, but also not in vain this night.
<br><br>The demon spirit child quietly outlines her red lips.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er had the same calculations in mind.
<br><br>Although Yi Feng's knife can be seen extraordinary, but do not know exactly how valuable, but at least the demon spirit child's scimitar is a good thing.
<br><br>The copper piece she knew was very valuable, but she did not know exactly what it did, and if she could win the knife and dagger with this as a bet, it could bring a large amount of income to their chamber.
<br><br>It would be great to have a windfall before completing your father's mission!
