Said.
<br><br>Skull Benevolent offered the petunia in his hand.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>A few cold flashes came out and the petals of the petunia flower chipped off.
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>With an ice-cold drink, Li Yihan glanced at Bone Ben Wei in disgust and left with a single stride.
<br><br>If not for the journey down, with her character, I'm afraid she would have already cut this rascal to the sword.
<br><br>Grasping the petunia in his hand, Bone Ben Wei hurriedly shouted: "Eh Eh Auntie, why be so grumpy, is my Bone Ben Wei's temperament still can not impress you?"
<br><br>But around, where there is still Li Yihan's shadow.
<br><br>In the camp.
<br><br>Although it is already spring, but the night is still quite cool, so Yi Feng lit a fire. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Then got out some beast meat from the ring of space and engaged in a barbecue.
<br><br>After grilling, Wu Yonghong and Old Wangtou and the others all wolfed down their food.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>But Yi Feng sighed and shook his head.
<br><br>"What's wrong sir."
<br><br>Old Wang Tau asked in confusion.
<br><br>"This meat is really not good." Yi Feng took two bites and threw it on the ground, because although these beast meat was well preserved inside the ring, it really wasn't very fresh to eat.
<br><br>However, the old king head and others had a thump in their hearts.
<br><br>These meat can be the meat of the demon king, and the gentleman is actually still not satisfied?
<br><br>"Everyone remember ha, if you come across any fresh game, you can't let him get away!" Yi Feng had to chew up the dry food, while saying towards the crowd.
<br><br>"Fresh game?"
<br><br>The people looked at each other.
<br><br>At once, they were a bit confused.
<br><br>Because the meaning of Yi Feng's words is obvious, the demon king meat is already tasteless, this fresh game must be at least demon emperor or even above.
<br><br>But if there is a demon king demon clan around what is okay, get to Mr. as a midnight snack is also considered his blessing, but the key here belongs to the human territory, there will be no demon beast ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, the old king asked cautiously: "Sir, this kind of place, you want fresh game, I'm afraid it is difficult to find ah!"
<br><br>"Which is that difficult?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave Old Wang Tau a white glance and said, "Look at this surrounding environment, you will always find it."
<br><br>The surrounding environment, will always find?
<br><br>The people looked at each other.
<br><br>For a moment did not comprehend the meaning of Yi Feng's words, but they all took note of it in their minds by heart.
<br><br>"So tired!"
<br><br>"You guys go to bed early, I'll sleep first."
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched a lazy back, then ready to lie down to sleep.
<br><br>Sleepiness.
<br><br>It came all at once.
<br><br>But just as he entered the state, a sudden sound interrupted his beautiful dream.
<br><br>"Bang Bang ......"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Phew ......"
<br><br>It was the sound of blasting from the battle not far away that came, ear-piercing and hard to hear.
<br><br>Of course, in addition to this, there were cultivators flying across the sky from time to time, bringing up a series of whistling sounds.
<br><br>"Grass, annoying or not!"
<br><br>This immediately touched the nerve of Yi Feng, bed full of gas he broke into a cuss: "This group of broken cultivation is simply too annoying, you want to receive what you receive, run far away can not?"
<br><br>Suddenly sat up cursing Yi Feng, violently touched the nerves of the old king's head and pork rong and other people.
<br><br>A heavy face.
<br><br>These people in Nansha really do not open their eyes ah, knowing that Mr. is to experience the life of mortals, but also make such a big show, attracting so many cultivators to blind a few fly.
<br><br>Damned if you don't know, but also affect Mr. sleep.
<br><br>It is intolerable!
<br><br>"Sir, it's okay, it's okay, you rest, you take a good rest."
<br><br>"Yes sir, you hurry up and rest, don't be ordinary with these people."
<br><br>Pork Rong and other people's hearts jumped to comfort the Yi Feng, afraid that Yi Feng was therefore a great anger.
<br><br>"All right, all right, you guys finish it also hurry to sleep!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, found a few grass to himself and his disciples made two pairs of earplugs, stuffed into the ears.
<br><br>Just lie down, think it is still not safe, and from the storage ring took out a few pills.
<br><br>The effect of this pill is very ordinary, and the former life of sleeping pills, because Yi Feng afraid to run over, because the distance is too far jet lag and cause sleep and prepared.
<br><br>I didn't think it would come in handy so soon.
<br><br>"Disciple, you also have one."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted, while throwing one in Zhong Qing's mouth.
<br><br>After taking the sleep aid, sleepiness soon came.
<br><br>The master and disciple gradually snored lightly by the fire.
<br><br>Seeing the master and disciple finally fell asleep, Pork Rong and the old king's head and others were relieved.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>Their eyes changed, sharp color flashed.
<br><br>Coincidentally, Pork Rong, Old Wang Tau, Wu Yonghong, Zhuge Rong, Chu Mad Lion five people slowly stood up.
<br><br>Then, with gloomy faces, they disappeared into the night ......
