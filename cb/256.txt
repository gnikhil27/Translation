"What?"
<br><br>"How is this possible?"
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Li Yuan was struck by lightning, and an unbelievable voice came from his staring eyes.
<br><br>"Don't believe it, do you?"
<br><br>"Then I'll let you believe it."
<br><br>Li Yihan pointed painfully at the direction where Yi Feng and the others had just settled down and said word by word, "Here, sitting there are two Second Life Martial Emperors."
<br><br>"Here, are four Martial Saints."
<br><br>"And the black robe here is an existence beyond Martial Emperors."
<br><br>"As for the gentleman sitting here, that is an existence that you and I cannot imagine."
<br><br>After saying that, she remembered something and added, saying, "Right, and here, the dog lying on the ground just now, is also an existence that can casually slap away any clan in Nansha with a single paw." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"So, this is, what you call a mortal!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This one by one information landed in Li Yuan's ears, like a nine-day Xuan Lei resounding in his ears.
<br><br>He retreated backwards, his face pale, his mouth muttering, "This is impossible, how is this possible ......"
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Li Yuan could not accept this fact for a while and forced himself to comfort himself.
<br><br>However, he knew his daughter's character well, and there was absolutely no need to lie to him.
<br><br>In other words, the big man that countless big powers in Nansha couldn't even lick came to his house, and he drove it away.
<br><br>At the thought of this, his face became bloodless.
<br><br>However, he still forced a smile towards Li Yihan and comforted him, "Han'er, this is indeed my father's fault, because I really didn't know their identity!"
<br><br>"Besides, I just invited them away, I didn't offend them, it might just be a great opportunity that was cut off, it might be that our Li family doesn't have this life, people have to look at it, so it's not a big deal, don't be angry."
<br><br>But his voice just fell.
<br><br>The housekeeper of the Li family came running with an ugly face and shouted, "Master, it's not good, it's not good, something big has happened."
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Li Yuan asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"News has just come that the Royal Sword Sect, to which we are attached, has moved us out of the subordinate clans, and the three hundred stores that the Royal Sword Sect has given us have all been taken back."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Li Yuan's face changed, but before he could speak, someone else hurriedly came to report.
<br><br>"Report master, just received the transmission jade slip, our Li family and Wind Cloud Valley lower sect Wanbao Hall's cooperation, has been unilaterally canceled by Wanbao Hall."
<br><br>"Report."
<br><br>Then, someone else rushed in with an ugly face and shouted, "The Blowing Snow Villa, which the young duke joined, has expelled him from the sect, and at the same time, all the other disciples of our Li family who joined the sect have also been expelled from the sect."
<br><br>And after these few people, someone else from time to time came with a bad news.
<br><br>This bad news fell on Li Yuan's ears and finally caused Li Yuan's face to lose its blood color and sat on his butt on the ground.
<br><br>From the news that came just now, all of his Li family's connections, business, backers, as well as the contacts and resources that had been accumulated over so many years, all went down the drain at this moment.
<br><br>"Why is this happening?"
<br><br>Li Yuan sat paralyzed on the ground, tears flowing from his old eyes.
<br><br>"Why do you think it's like this?"
<br><br>Li Yihan said without the slightest surprise, "Because, you have offended that gentleman, and for me, you can still be forgiven for not knowing their identity to send them off, but do you know that they are still the benefactors of my life?"
<br><br>"It's not too much for our ungrateful Li family to end up in this situation."
<br><br>After saying that, Li Yihan left the Li family with a cold face, leaving one sentence before leaving.
<br><br>"I'm going to find Mr. Redemption, and won't be back for a while."
<br><br>Looking at Li Yihan's departing back, Li Yuan sat down on the ground, his hair instantly turned white, and a strong sense of regret filled his heart.
<br><br>In his mouth, he could no longer say the words that he had just made light of.
<br><br>Outside of Jiayi City.
<br><br>A group of great powers in Nansha gathered here.
<br><br>"How did things go?"
<br><br>Li Shuhua and the others asked.
<br><br>"Your honor, we inquired from a subordinate of the Li family that the gentleman did go to the Li family, but the Li family head seemed to have driven them away." This subordinate responded.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu, Li Shuhua and a group of other big figures' faces all changed greatly, they were always speculating the purpose of this one coming to Nansha, so they would pry into the places that Yi Feng had experienced and any wind and grass.
<br><br>When Yi Feng entered the Li family from the beginning, they originally thought that a big power will rise, but the Li family will be Mr. expelled.
<br><br>Where the hell is this big star number than?
<br><br>"But the lords do not worry, we have jade brief transmission back to the clan, several major clans have jointly cut off all and the Li family's dealings, originally wanted to directly exterminate the Li family, but that gentleman did not even do it, we do not do it in name." That subordinate responded.
<br><br>"Hmm."
<br><br>"Indeed."
<br><br>The bigwigs present nodded their heads and agreed that the decision was well made, it was just right that they would not get into trouble and not cross the line.
<br><br>But the crowd was just about to continue to follow Yi Feng and the others all the way far when another big event happened, and this one, a big shot from the East Victory Continent.
<br><br>East victory continent.
<br><br>Is more prosperous place.
<br><br>The entire South Sand in the East Victory Continent, is only a small piece of it.
<br><br>One month ago, this big person from the East Victory Continent sent a message that he would come to Nansha to travel for a period of time and inspect the sects in Nansha.
<br><br>Originally, for this upcoming big shot, the big brothers of the clans in Nansha had already discussed and gathered to receive him collectively on the day of his arrival.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's arrival and the series of big events caused, so that these clans in Nansha, forget about this big man of the East Sheng Continent.
<br><br>This is not.
<br><br>News had just come that this big man who had been left out in the cold was therefore furious.
<br><br>This made a group of bigwigs in Nansha, for a time, did not know what to do.
<br><br>If it is the general people of the East Victory Continent, it is just, after all, compared to Yi Feng they also know which is more important.
<br><br>The key to this big man, not ordinary people.
<br><br>Is the founder of the East Victory Continent Form of Yi Taiji door, is considered the founding ancestor.
<br><br>This person's name is Ma Baoguo, with a move of lightning five consecutive whips left a great reputation, the continent is full of his legend.
<br><br>The most crucial thing is that this person is only sixty-nine years old.
<br><br>In the entire cultivation world, sixty-nine is just a young man, but this age will become the founder of the mountain, this is enough to show the horror of this person's talent.
<br><br>Speaking of which, this big man and Yi Feng is also very similar, many years ago has retired to the background, these years almost no one can see his cultivation, and no one can see his cultivation, the surface looks like a mortal.
<br><br>But because it is not possible to see his depth, so that the East Victory Continent in the several super sects of experts, and therefore scornful of three points.
<br><br>Some people guessed that he was at least a Ten Life Martial Emperor.
<br><br>Others speculated that he had already become an immortal.
<br><br>But no matter what, this matter has made this group of people in Nansha in a difficult situation.
<br><br>Yi Feng and Ma Baoguo, two supreme experts who could not see through their cultivation, how should they choose?
