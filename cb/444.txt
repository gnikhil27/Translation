Seeing the situation.
<br><br>The two old men turned their gaze to the distant sky.
<br><br>No surprises.
<br><br>Under the summoning of Bai Shanyi, the two Soul Suppressing Nails that were sensed would soon break through the air and return.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>After waiting for a moment, the surrounding void was actually half-motion.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Bai Shanyi's brow was also a frown.
<br><br>Another complicated hand seal was struck, but when her hand seal fell, the whole person's breath was cold and she stood up violently.
<br><br>"What's wrong Goddess?"
<br><br>The two old men asked in a hurry. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"The aura of the Soul Suppressing Nail has completely disappeared."
<br><br>Bai Shao's face was covered with frost.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The two old men were also astonished.
<br><br>"Could it be that that person erased the aura that you left on the Soul Suppressing Nail, Goddess?" One of the old men guessed.
<br><br>"It's not easy to say."
<br><br>Bai Shao said coldly with a ghostly glint in her eyes, "But no matter what, this person was able to make the Soul Suppressing Nail break its connection with me without my knowledge, so it's still a bit of a tactic."
<br><br>"Then should the two of us go personally and bring this person back to you?" An old man said.
<br><br>"No harm!"
<br><br>White shallow a swing up jade palm, said indifferently: "two soul nails only, I can still afford to lose, and although this person has some means, but not so much as to be put in my eyes, much less worth the two of you personally go, one day when the time comes, and then capture him as our slaves is it."
<br><br>"Then, Goddess, what should we do next?"
<br><br>The two old men asked respectfully.
<br><br>"Since we came out, we can't just get some broken iron and go back, there must be some other harvest."
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi looked down at Beihai Lu and raised the corner of his mouth, his eyes full of contempt.
<br><br>"What do you mean, Goddess?"
<br><br>The two old men looked at her.
<br><br>"What I mean is that there should always be something we need in the vast North Sea Land."
<br><br>"Your next task is to search for treasures in the Northern Sea Continent."
<br><br>"No matter if it's sealed, in a hidden secret realm, or in the hands of someone, as long as it's something good, bring it back to me."
<br><br>Bai Shangyi said with a cold smile on her face.
<br><br>"Goddess, don't worry, we will definitely bring back something that you like for the Goddess."
<br><br>The two old men bowed their heads respectfully, then with a swipe of their bodies, they left the flying boat.
<br><br>"Daughter."
<br><br>"I'm going to break through."
<br><br>Qingniu Clan.
<br><br>Night Energy poured down another cup of tea and suddenly raised his head to emit an excited voice.
<br><br>"Father, I am too."
<br><br>Night Yi was equally excited.
<br><br>"Then it's not too late, let's break through right there!"
<br><br>Night Energy said excitedly.
<br><br>Then father and daughter both sat cross-legged and entered a state of deep concentration and quietness.
<br><br>This step.
<br><br>It is the biggest sharp change for both father and daughter.
<br><br>Because of the Immortal Irrigation, the Immortal River continent for many years, the ceiling is only ten life Martial Emperor corresponds to the cultivation of the Human Immortal.
<br><br>Even though there are many old monsters, because of years of heritage and accumulation, broke through this ceiling when the Immortal Irrigation re-entered the Immortal River Continent, but such people are few and far between.
<br><br>And the father and daughter at this moment, but at this time to step into this step.
<br><br>The sharp change from Human Immortal to Earth Immortal, this is not just an increase in strength, but a qualitative improvement.
<br><br>The breakthrough of the two people did not cause much commotion.
<br><br>Because under the Immortal, relying on the rules of the Immortal River Continent and the power of the Immortal River Continent, being in the Immortal River Continent, the breakthrough must have caused a big commotion.
<br><br>But when you reach the Immortal, what you cultivate is yourself.
<br><br>In a way, one's own body is like a small world, and all the sharp changes are inside this small world.
<br><br>Soon after, the father and daughter broke through to the realm of Earth Immortal.
<br><br>The powerful strength made the faces of the two overflow with a confident glow, where there was still the half-dead and wretched appearance when they came.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Sir has returned."
<br><br>At this moment, Night Energy exclaimed.
<br><br>Then he saw that Yi Feng was walking back from afar with Wu Tao Xiaodai.
<br><br>The two of them rushed to welcome them.
<br><br>"Night Neng, Night Yi, meet sir." The two men said respectfully.
<br><br>"You guys don't have to be polite, sit."
<br><br>Yi Feng was not surprised by the arrival of the two, after all, the last time he ate at Xiaodai's house, this father and daughter two knew that they were in the Qingniu Sect.
<br><br>The two, however, did not dare to sit, but looked at Yi Feng avidly and bowed down.
<br><br>"Sir's saving grace, we have no teeth to forget."
<br><br>Sincere voices came out from the two men's mouths, leaving Yi Feng's heart filled with speechlessness.
<br><br>This father and daughter, simply.
<br><br>It's just that they saved Nighty once, is it necessary to thank them once when they meet?
<br><br>Although the heart knows that the two people are grateful, but this kind of too polite feeling, Yi Feng does not like too much.
<br><br>"The past, there is no need to mention it again." Yi Feng said softly, "And it's no big deal, no need to put it on your mind."
<br><br>The two Night Energy people hurriedly shut their mouths.
<br><br>It seems that Mr. has really known all this happened for a long time.
<br><br>But when they heard Yi Feng's tone so unconcerned, the two still couldn't help but feel sad.
<br><br>Sir is sir.
<br><br>It is actually said so lightly.
<br><br>But it is also true that the legendary weapon of great evil soul nail, that is, Mr. a cup of tea can handle things, not put in the eye.
<br><br>"Right Xiaodai, you do not still want to paint the portrait of a person, Wu Tao and I two big men have nothing to paint, you let the night Yi girl a favor!" Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>"Good, night Yi sister so beautiful, I have long wanted to draw her." Yun Wu clapped her little hands and said cheerfully.
<br><br>"Then Miss Night Yi will trouble you."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said.
<br><br>"What did you say sir, it's my honor to be able to serve sir and Miss Xiaodai."
<br><br>Night Yi hurriedly straightened her grooming and sat at the side at Yi Feng's command.
<br><br>Under Yi Feng's guidance, Xiaodai gradually drew out the outline of Night Yi, and the beautiful posture in the painting was generally the same as Night Yi herself.
<br><br>It could be seen that Yun Dao did have a few talents in painting.
<br><br>Time passed slowly.
<br><br>Finally, after an hour, a woman in white sitting with her cheeks on her head, appeared in the painting, vividly.
<br><br>"Miss Xiaodai's painting is really great."
<br><br>Seeing the painting completed, the two father and daughter of Night Energy were busy bringing their heads over and couldn't help but pass out their praises.
<br><br>What made them feel even more incredible was that the painting, like the last one, contained a lot of the power of the Great Dao.
<br><br>"How about it, Master, I drew it well, didn't I."
<br><br>Xiaodai excitedly invited credit towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and appreciated, "But the divine charm is still a few points short."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng picked up the brush and added a few strokes to the painting with light discretion.
<br><br>These few strokes.
<br><br>It was like drawing a dragon to dot the eyes.
<br><br>The painting on the night Yi's charm, completely expressed.
<br><br>And next to the night can and night Yi is to cover the mouth almost exclaimed.
<br><br>Because after these few strokes fell, they clearly saw a golden light flash in the painting.
<br><br>At the same time the quality of the entire painting has increased by several levels, which contains a rich power of the Great Dao.
<br><br>And the painting of the night Yi, more like an ancient powerhouse, seemingly small family sitting there, but a feeling of the world, as if about to walk out of the painting.
<br><br>No matter which direction you look from, her gaze is burning and compelling, horrifying.
<br><br>Night Yi herself stared, completely unable to believe that the person in the painting is himself.
<br><br>Even she, her real body, became dwarfed in front of the woman in this painting.
<br><br>"See the reason why I added these strokes?" Yi Feng asked toward Xiaodai.
<br><br>"Hehehe."
<br><br>Xiaodai scratched his head, seeming to understand.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>Also not forced.
<br><br>This aspect, still have to slowly understand.
<br><br>"Miss Night, if you are satisfied with this painting, it will be given to you." Yi Feng smiled towards Night Yi at the side.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Give it to me?"
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>Night Yi was alarmed and full of incredulity.
<br><br>"It's just a painting, it's no big deal, thanks to your help, take it." Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>"Thank you very much, sir."
<br><br>Night Yi took the portrait lovingly, full of gratitude to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Right two, there is one more thing that I need your help to help a little." Yi Feng remembered something and said again.
<br><br>"Please speak, sir."
<br><br>The two men stood aside respectfully.
<br><br>"Xiaodai's parents, you guys go and take care of them more."
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a soft voice.
<br><br>After all, he was also thinking that after a while Xiaodai would be brought back to Dongsheng by him, and the two old people left behind would be able to be much more convenient if they had someone to look after them.
<br><br>"What did you say, sir, this is what should be done, we promise, we will take care of the two old people." Night can pat the stick and said.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng nodded his head and showed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>After staying for a few moments, the two Night Neng never heard Yi Feng mention anything about Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>It seems that Mr. indeed did not put Bai Shanyi in his eyes.
<br><br>So there was no need for the two of them to stay any longer, so they got up and said goodbye.
<br><br>"Both of you, take care."
<br><br>"However, remember what I have just explained to you."
<br><br>"Don't ever forget."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>"Don't worry, sir."
<br><br>The two bowed and excused themselves, leaving the Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>"Father, what do we do next? There's also that white shallow one ......"
<br><br>Night Yi asked.
<br><br>"Go to Baier City, Little Dance girl's home." Night Energy said with a straight face.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Night Yi is a little puzzled.
<br><br>"Although sir has not explicitly said anything, but twice mentioned for us to look after Little Dance girl's parents, I reckon it is likely that sir is guiding us to something." Night Energy guessed.
<br><br>At these words, Night Yi nodded her head with sudden realization.
<br><br>When they were leaving the house, Mister did make a point to remind them not to forget.
<br><br>The two swept out and rushed towards Baier City.
