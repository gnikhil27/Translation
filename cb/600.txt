"What the hell is going on!"
<br><br>A group of disciples were wondering and scratching their ears.
<br><br>But couldn't think of anything.
<br><br>Yang Yi, who was sitting in the crowd, also felt it.
<br><br>He was also very strange.
<br><br>But now was not the time to be strange at all.
<br><br>So opened his mouth and interrupted the crowd's crossed ears and doubts, "Even if it's tens of times thicker than outside, it's not bad."
<br><br>"Let's just seize the time and absorb a little bit more as we can."
<br><br>Hearing Yang Yi's words, the crowd also felt indeed.
<br><br>So they no longer dwelled on it.
<br><br>So they all closed their eyes and started to meditate and cultivate again. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At the same time, sitting in the pool Yi Feng, want to sleep but can not sleep.
<br><br>This pool of stones, too choking!
<br><br>He changed to a slightly more comfortable place.
<br><br>Just right, pi eye is still bubbling on the spring.
<br><br>The top absorbs, the bottom also absorbs.
<br><br>Two-pronged approach, although they do not know how to exhale, but with their own rare talent in ten thousand years, may sleep up on a big rise!
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng was satisfied. Sleepiness also came with it.
<br><br>He yawned.
<br><br>"Ah ......"
<br><br>Deeply inhale.
<br><br>"Ha ......"
<br><br>A deep exhale.
<br><br>Ready to sleep.
<br><br>"Nooooo! This aura has dropped again!" A disciple snapped open his eyes, surprised and frozen at the same time.
<br><br>There were many other disciples who opened their eyes together.
<br><br>"Not only has it dropped, it feels like it's completely gone!" Another disciple spat indignantly.
<br><br>Outside the outer secret gate, Liu Yan, who hadn't left yet, and the elder guarding the gate stood in the same place.
<br><br>Talking.
<br><br>One of the elders sighed long and worried, "This outer secret realm, I'm afraid it's the last time to pinch in the hands of our Star Peak."
<br><br>Liu Yan also smiled bitterly, helpless and reluctant, "Yes."
<br><br>"Over the years, Guo Shijie has been coveting my outer sect secret realm for a long time, and the conflict between our Star Peak and Sun Moon Peak has been constant since we found this secret realm."
<br><br>"After dragging on for so many years, this time, I'm afraid it's hard to drag on anymore."
<br><br>Another Star Peak third elder listened indignantly, "Really abominable, on what grounds, this outer sect secret realm, was originally found by people in my Star Peak unintentionally!"
<br><br>"Why should we give it to them if Guo Shijie wants it?"
<br><br>This outer secret realm was discovered unintentionally in an extremely remote place by the people of Star Peak when they went on a mission.
<br><br>It was later linked to the Sun Moon Sect by the clan using a secret method as a way to use it for the clan.
<br><br>However, because it was found by someone from Star Peak, it has been under the jurisdiction of Star Peak.
<br><br>It is said that the entire clan can use, but for the sake of aura breeding fear of overuse, each peak has a limit on the number of times.
<br><br>Only the Star Peak people, because of the jurisdictional reasons, the number of times to use than other peaks a lot.
<br><br>But because this is the Star Peak found, so the Sun and Moon clan also let them go.
<br><br>But Guo Shijie does not see so.
<br><br>Coveted for a long time.
<br><br>Because of this, Guo Shijie then began to compete with Star Peak.
<br><br>That elder also shook his head, "after all, the patriarch personally issued a message, this time the disciples of the great trial, which peak disciples have good results, the outer secret realm jurisdiction will belong to which peak."
<br><br>The third elder heard a "hum" from his nose.
<br><br>"The patriarch clearly knows that Guo Shijie's mind, what outer secret realm should belong to the strong."
<br><br>"The weak use it is a waste."
<br><br>"If Guo Shijie hadn't poached many useful talents with unseemly methods over the years, I wouldn't have been able to recruit good seedlings for Star Peak!"
<br><br>"If he has the ability to let him find a secret realm himself, I think the patriarch is biased Sun Moon Peak."
<br><br>Liu Yan also sighed and stopped the third elder from continuing his words, "Since the patriarch has spoken."
<br><br>"We don't have much chance of winning this Disciple Trial Conference either."
<br><br>"Let them enjoy it for the first and last time."
<br><br>"What last time, we must not give up this secret realm!" The third elder spoke out, "We are now being suppressed and humiliated by Sun Moon Peak, if we give up the secret realm, will they not be even more arrogant?!"
<br><br>"How far would they have to go to humiliate my Star Peak?
<br><br>"The third elder has a point." Another elder also responded, "Anyway, we must do our best to preserve this secret realm."
<br><br>Liu Yan did not say anything, his expression was grave.
<br><br>After a moment of silence, he only said, "I will go back first, and I will come back to pick them up in two days."
<br><br>"I beg the elders to guard the door of the secret realm."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Several elders answered.
<br><br>Liu Yan was about to leave when she heard a "rumble".
<br><br>She turned around and saw that the door of the secret realm was slowly opening.
<br><br>Several elders and Liu Yan were dumbfounded.
<br><br>In the next moment, they saw disciples coming out from inside one after another, cursing and swearing.
<br><br>"Why are you guys coming out?!" Liu Yan was shocked.
<br><br>Yang Yi walked at the front of the crowd and said with a depressed face, "There is a problem with the aura inside."
<br><br>"Just went in although not as much as expected, but it's okay. As a result, as time goes by, it turns out to be less and less."
<br><br>"Now there's even no aura at all."
<br><br>"It's better to cultivate outside."
<br><br>The disciples next to him echoed Yang Yi's words.
<br><br>"How is it possible?!" Liu Yan was shocked to hear, "How can there be no more?"
<br><br>She looked at Yi Feng who was the only one not cursing and talking.
<br><br>Yi Feng saw Liu Yan's gaze looking at himself.
<br><br>His face showed embarrassment.
<br><br>To be honest, he, who could not exhale cultivation, was pressed to feel any change in aura except for that milky white gas disappearing.
<br><br>However, in order to prevent the matter that he could not exhale cultivation from being known by others, he also chose to echo the voice.
<br><br>"Senior brother is right, there is no spiritual qi inside now!"
<br><br>"And I don't know what the damn problem is."
<br><br>Liu Yan and several elders dropped their jaws in shock as they listened.
<br><br>Even though everyone was in agreement, several people still found it unbelievable.
<br><br>So they walked into the secret realm.
<br><br>When they looked, they were all shocked.
<br><br>The entire secret realm was completely devoid of the rich white aura, and even the pool had dried up.
<br><br>The immortal grasses in the secret realm, which were nourished by the spiritual energy and growing like crazy, also withered.
<br><br>Several people closed their eyes and felt it.
<br><br>Really ...... completely no aura ......
<br><br>Not to mention what the secret realm, it is simply a hairless place.
<br><br>"This ......" Liu Yan, although he did not want to believe the sight in front of him, had to believe it at this moment.
<br><br>"What on earth is the reason?" One of the elders also out in shock, he also felt it, the entire mysterious realm, there is no spiritual energy at all!
<br><br>"How could there suddenly be no spiritual qi in this secret realm?!"
<br><br>The words fell, the third elder stomped his foot, his face full of hate, "I know, it must be Guo Shijie who used a dirty trick to harm my Star Peak secret realm!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, it must be Guo Shijie!"
<br><br>"Yes, no one will come to destroy this outer secret realm except for the people from Sun Moon Peak!"
<br><br>The third elder was so angry that he jumped to his feet, "This Guo Shijie guy is too deceitful! I'll kill him!"
<br><br>Hearing that, Liu Yan was also furious!
