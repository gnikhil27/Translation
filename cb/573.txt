Even though Yi Feng didn't spend this time, the things he bought at the store last time were more than enough.
<br><br>Now within a hundred meters around his martial arts school, it has been completely shaped into a small orchard with beautiful mountains and clear water, in stark contrast to the barren environment elsewhere.
<br><br>Every day after hunting and killing playing vultures, Yi Feng lay in front of the martial hall on Shadow Island, looking at the sea view while eating fruits and drinking the wine brought from the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>The fragrance of wine was overflowing.
<br><br>However, the wolf skin he was wearing was really not worthy of his leisurely and elegant life.
<br><br>Luckily, he still had a set stored in his Ring of Space, which was prepared to prevent him from running around naked when he went out in the future.
<br><br>But now he is here in such a good environment, do not have to bear the wind and rain, this clothing wears also wear.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>A cliff in the middle.
<br><br>A body skin and bones, a man in a deep sleep, opened his eyes with difficulty.
<br><br>At the same time sniffing and moving the nose. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Wine!"
<br><br>"This is the scent of wine!"
<br><br>He breathed greedily, and his body trembled with excitement.
<br><br>It was hard to imagine.
<br><br>A person who had been imprisoned on this island for countless years and could only rely on slumber to keep his body functions down to a minimum to keep lingering, how much his heart stirred when he smelled the scent of wine at this moment.
<br><br>He also does not know how many years to stay under this cliff, the body has long been brutal air erosion is not like.
<br><br>But perhaps because of the seduction of the fragrance of wine, he ran up the few forces in his body, slowly stood up for many years did not stand up.
<br><br>With the power to run, his look of exhaustion also slightly better.
<br><br>He followed the scent of wine all the way up the hill.
<br><br>As he got closer, the wine scent became more and more adequate, and the more greedy he looked when he breathed.
<br><br>"This is the state of exhaustion, if I can get a sip of wine, death is worth it."
<br><br>He murmured weakly to himself, his eyes flickering with hope.
<br><br>It was obvious what kind of inhuman torture the people who were locked up here had to go through.
<br><br>The people who are qualified to come here are already of great strength.
<br><br>But today, his wish before he dies is just a sip of wine.
<br><br>The smell of wine is getting stronger and stronger.
<br><br>This means that the distance is also getting closer and closer.
<br><br>He could be sure that it was just ahead on the hill.
<br><br>He was busy lifting his head up.
<br><br>But this head up shall not be.
<br><br>He was so shocked that his eyes were about to burst.
<br><br>Look, what is that!
<br><br>Green.
<br><br>Big trees.
<br><br>Orchard.
<br><br>There are also fucking houses.
<br><br>The scene in front of him already made him unable to describe his excitement with words.
<br><br>He could not remember how many years he had been coming to Shadow Island.
<br><br>But on this island, in addition to the black sea, see is endless barren barren barren barren barren ......
<br><br>Today.
<br><br>Yet there was vegetation and orchards.
<br><br>He almost trotted up and rushed to that place.
<br><br>Even the increasingly strong scent of wine was ignored by him.
<br><br>He finally.
<br><br>Came outside that house.
<br><br>His heart was even more shocked.
<br><br>Because around this house, is actually filled with a compelling aura, brutal air erosion can not be half.
<br><br>He breathed in greedily.
<br><br>More than that, he spread his hands and lifted his head to breathe deeply.
<br><br>Also almost shed tears.
<br><br>"Air."
<br><br>"Fresh air ah!"
<br><br>While his body trembled, he shouted out excitedly.
<br><br>He could not remember how many years it had been since he had felt this kind of environment.
<br><br>Under this aura, he felt that his internal organs, which had been eroded by the brutal air, were all much better.
<br><br>The dry and thirsty throat also became nourished beyond measure.
<br><br>In a short moment, his face also instantly became rosy, and he was like two people when he just walked out from the broken cliff.
<br><br>Suddenly at that moment.
<br><br>Next to the door of the house, came a white-robed youth.
<br><br>The first time the man looked at this white-robed youth.
<br><br>Almost a deathless gaze.
<br><br>The white robe was spotless.
<br><br>The face was rosy as usual.
<br><br>Extraordinary temperament.
<br><br>Holding a small pot in his left hand and a small cup in his right hand.
<br><br>This look is not at all like someone who survives on this island.
<br><br>What kind of a person is this?
<br><br>Doubts arose in the man's heart.
<br><br>"You are also someone who is imprisoned on this island, right?" Yi Feng looked at the wretched man in front of him and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Yes, I wonder if you, you are?"
<br><br>The man looked at Yi Feng and answered hoarsely.
<br><br>"My name is Yi Feng, come in first and have a seat!"
<br><br>As he spoke, Yi Feng sighed secretly.
<br><br>The people locked up on this island are really miserable.
<br><br>After saying that, he then turned around and walked towards the courtyard.
<br><br>The man nodded, holding doubts in his heart, and followed Yi Feng.
<br><br>He wasn't afraid that Yi Feng would turn against him.
<br><br>After all, his situation was now so bad that there was no lower limit.
<br><br>On the contrary.
<br><br>He desperately wanted to find out, this youth in front of him, who was he?
<br><br>Why was he on this island? Was he locked in?
<br><br>Also, why is there not only vegetation here, but also fruits ......
<br><br>"You must be curious as to why I am like this here, right?" Just after walking into the courtyard, Yi Feng opened his mouth with a smile.
<br><br>The man nodded, turned his inquiring gaze to Yi Feng and said, "I guess you weren't locked in, right?"
<br><br>"Good, I was indeed not imprisoned." Yi Feng said with a smile, "Speaking of which, it's kind of an accident!"
<br><br>"A misadventure?"
<br><br>The man looked at Yi Feng in confusion.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled without saying anything.
<br><br>Shit.
<br><br>This kind of ascension over, was randomly transported here embarrassing things or do not be a person all say.
<br><br>"Anyway, coming here was an accident, I'll stay for a while and then leave." Yi Feng then said.
<br><br>"Accident, stay for a while and then go?"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the man's pupils couldn't help but shrink.
<br><br>This sentence.
<br><br>It had a deep meaning.
<br><br>Didn't the words mean that the taboo around Shadow Island couldn't trap this person at all?
<br><br>He could come and go whenever he wanted to?
