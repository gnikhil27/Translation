"No, not only that."
<br><br>"The subordinate countries that formerly belonged to the Imperial Overlords, the Heavenly Dragon Empire, the Vault of Heaven Empire, the Heavenly Fire Empire, and the Wind and Cloud Empire have launched rebellions."
<br><br>"All have joined forces with Wu Tian's army."
<br><br>"And according to the report from the scouts, the Mist Sect Patriarch, the Heavenly One Patriarch, the Heavenly Dragon Kingdom Monarch, the Cang Dome Kingdom Monarch, the Heavenly Fire Kingdom Monarch, the Wind and Cloud Kingdom Monarch, the Yuan Zun, Wu Tian and so many others have gathered together and lit bonfires as if they were dancing together in something called square dance."
<br><br>"Looking at its situation, they seem to be very happy."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The moment this news came.
<br><br>Perdition and the Genting kingdom monarch's face turned white, a staggering stand unstable, almost planted on the ground.
<br><br>"How could that be?"
<br><br>"How could this happen?"
<br><br>The voice was muttered with a mouth full of dullness. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In this moment, the two people seemed to have aged countless years.
<br><br>Also at the same time, the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar next to them also changed.
<br><br>The two people looked their eyes over.
<br><br>After a brief foreshadowing change, the already small amount of Qi luck in the Qi luck immortal pillar brushed off and lowered violently.
<br><br>Until finally, only a tiny sliver of afterglow was left clinging on.
<br><br>And this trace of afterglow, also because he cloud top empire is still alive, if one day cloud top empire also no longer exists, then this last trace is also afraid to be lost.
<br><br>The two men sat limp on the ground, their faces filled with trepidation.
<br><br>During this period of time, they had spent countless efforts and costs, originally thinking that they would soon be able to complete the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>But never thought that in exchange for this?
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>They had worked very hard.
<br><br>Obviously, they were following the Guidance Heavenly Book!
<br><br>"Someone is messing up!"
<br><br>Perdition roared hysterically, "Someone is definitely behind this."
<br><br>"From the moment I planned the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, I sensed that someone was messing with it behind the scenes, otherwise how could this happen?"
<br><br>At these words, the Genting kingdom ruler also stared.
<br><br>In the past, when Perdition said that there was a hand behind the chaos in the underworld, he didn't believe it, thinking that it was said by Perdition in order to shirk his responsibility.
<br><br>And now.
<br><br>He also finally believed the words of the world of extermination.
<br><br>Because once the things that happened during this time were correlated, they were able to find something fishy.
<br><br>Obviously everything is in their planning, but always able to change at the critical moment.
<br><br>If it was one or two, it would be fine.
<br><br>This may also be the cause of coincidence.
<br><br>But every thing has changed like this, then it does not make sense.
<br><br>Now they are absolutely sure.
<br><br>There is an invisible hand that is controlling everything behind the scenes.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler turned his gaze to Perdition.
<br><br>"Hmph, we are working for the Lord, daring to make trouble this is going against the Lord, this person must be uncovered." Extinguisher said with a fierce light in his eyes and clenched his fist.
<br><br>"Good, must be uncovered this person, otherwise, we may not be able to do anything." The Genting kingdom ruler also nodded his head quickly.
<br><br>"You quickly do as I instructed and set up the formation."
<br><br>Perdition got up and drank: "I will immediately use the power of the formation and use the power of the astrological signs given by the Lord to deduce, since this person is manipulating behind him, he is bound to leave traces and will always be able to be uncovered."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>"I'll get on it immediately!"
<br><br>The Genting monarch also understood the seriousness of the matter and did not dare to be the least bit slow.
<br><br>After ordering the matter down, and after preparing for a full three days, countless experts of Genting gathered together in unison.
<br><br>"Formation, rise."
<br><br>This time, it was the ruler of the Cloud Top Kingdom himself who was in charge of the formation.
<br><br>With a loud shout from him, countless experts simultaneously pushed their internal power and injected it towards the formation.
<br><br>And Perdition was standing at the very center of the formation.
<br><br>Absorbing the power in the formation.
<br><br>"The power of the star image."
<br><br>"Enlighten!"
<br><br>His palms moved with complicated hand seals, and with a violent shout, the entire sky of the Genting Imperial City suddenly darkened.
<br><br>It became invisible.
<br><br>And after a long time under the power of the extinguishing astral image, a glimmer of light finally appeared in the dark sky.
<br><br>It began to be covered with stars.
<br><br>At the same time as the stars drifted, they also flooded with countless unreadable mysterious runes.
<br><br>"Cause and effect."
<br><br>"Seek!"
<br><br>Exterminating the world watched the sky astrology, using the power of the astrology in the underworld, he began to capture all the characters who were associated with the matter of qi.
<br><br>In a moment.
<br><br>A message appeared in the sky, as well as different images.
<br><br>There was Wu Tian who had just blasted out of the imperial tomb.
<br><br>There was Jia Jia Qin and Mo Tian Ji who were standing in the sky and subdued Huang Tian.
<br><br>There was the Yuan Zun who was in closed-door cultivation in the underground palace at the top of the cloud.
<br><br>There was the gray-robed youth at the top of the Mist Sect's mountain peak who made 100,000 disciples kneel in submission with a raised hand.
<br><br>There were also the kings of the Cang Dao Empire as well as the Wind and Cloud Empire who had just recently assumed the throne.
<br><br>"No, these are not ......"
<br><br>Extinction closed his eyes, his mouth murmuring while shaking his head frantically.
<br><br>These were all the enemies on the surface.
<br><br>What he was looking for was the invisible tentacle behind him.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Deducing these people also gave him an important hint.
<br><br>That is, the change of qi luck, these people all play a vital role in it, and that tentacle, all must have had a connection with these people.
<br><br>And the one who has been associated with these people at the same time must be the one who is behind the control.
<br><br>"Everyone, give me unreserved power."
<br><br>The world of extinction shouted.
<br><br>His own forehead was also covered with sweat.
<br><br>Obviously, the deduction of the astrological power was extremely exhausting.
<br><br>The person who is able to control everything behind the scenes is certainly not an ordinary person, hiding in the shadows extremely deep, and it is not easy to find him.
<br><br>"All of you listen to the order, give me no reservation to use the power, as long as find out the person behind, I have a heavy reward!"
<br><br>The king of Genting knocked down a pill and shouted.
<br><br>When the rest of the people heard that, they also gritted their teeth and injected their power into the formation without reservation.
<br><br>With all the people working together, the stars in the sky, obviously brightened a lot.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>There were also images that were coalescing intermittently.
<br><br>"Hold on."
<br><br>"Initially found out the information of this person, immediately be able to clearly present!"
<br><br>Extermination clenched his teeth and drank.
<br><br>A long time passed, and under their unremitting persistence, the intermittent images finally began to be clear.
<br><br>"There it is."
<br><br>Seeing this, Perisher shouted excitedly.
<br><br>The Genting Empire and the others also showed joy, and while breathing a huge sigh of relief, they raised their heads in unison and focused their gazes towards the sky.
<br><br>The first thing that appeared in the picture was a short figure.
<br><br>Dressed very unique.
<br><br>Tight pants ......
<br><br>Beans shoes ......
