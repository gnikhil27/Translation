Three people you look at me, I look at you, mood apprehension followed Yi Feng into the martial arts hall.
<br><br>After walking into the martial arts hall, shaking the sky Que body trembled violently, a hand grabbed Guan Yunpeng's arm and pulled: "Look quickly, look, old tube, look take an umbrella."
<br><br>"Hoo, and the painting."
<br><br>"Hiss, this hoe, this hoe."
<br><br>At this moment, Ye Bei and Shake Tian Que master and apprentice two immediately stunned, because they master and apprentice two is the first time to come in the martial arts hall.
<br><br>And everywhere they looked, there were treasures.
<br><br>Looking at this startled master and disciple two, Guan Yunpeng could not help but white these two.
<br><br>At that moment, he puffed up his chest and said disdainfully, "You two are really right, the country bumpkins have not seen the world when they entered the city, what is there to be stirred up about?"
<br><br>"To tell you the truth, for all this of Mr., I have seen it long ago when I came to the martial arts school last time."
<br><br>"You guys have never seen Mr. writing and painting, if you did, you wouldn't know what kind of excitement you would have."
<br><br>"Humph!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Shake the sky Que master and disciple two face ugly light hum.
<br><br>So what if you've seen it, talking as if it has something to do with you!
<br><br>"Please sit down."
<br><br>Coming to the backyard, Yi Feng instructed them to sit down next to a tea set.
<br><br>Then he began to boil tea and make water.
<br><br>"This tea?"
<br><br>When the boiling water soaked into the tea leaves, the fragrance began to diffuse in all directions, and it smelled refreshing.
<br><br>What shocked them even more was that the fragrance actually mobilized the spiritual qi in their bodies, as if their cultivation had been refined by a few points.
<br><br>This one.
<br><br>Could it be that he wants to invite them to drink tea?
<br><br>At the thought of this, they were moved.
<br><br>The fragrance alone has such an effect, if they can really taste it, I'm afraid there will be unexpected benefits ah!
<br><br>But how can they taste the tea brewed by this person's hand?
<br><br>Just so thought, Yi Feng brought a cup of tea to each of them, smiled lightly and said: "Come, drink tea."
<br><br>The three people were shocked.
<br><br>At once, they were excited.
<br><br>I did not expect the thought to come true.
<br><br>Smelling the fragrance in the cup, the three people could not wait, picked up the cup and drank it down in one gulp.
<br><br>This sip of tea, the three people clearly feel a huge force into the body, while clearing their bodies of impurities, while refining their cultivation.
<br><br>For a time, the three excited can not use words to express their feelings.
<br><br>Even if they knew that the tea might have great benefits, but they never thought that the benefits would be so great.
<br><br>Because after a simple digestion, the three people clearly feel that their cultivation is already to the critical point, and will soon break through.
<br><br>"You guys drink slowly, no need to rush."
<br><br>Yi Feng watched the three people dry a cup in one gulp, couldn't help but frown and reminded.
<br><br>You know, this is freshly brewed boiling water ah, not afraid of scalding the throat?
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>The three people nodded their heads like chickens pecking rice.
<br><br>They also immediately understood that their appearance just now was too rude and had attracted some displeasure from this person.
<br><br>They just couldn't figure it out in their hearts.
<br><br>They had clearly offended Yi Feng, why did they still get this kind of treatment?
<br><br>Originally, this time Yi Feng was able to let them off the hook, they are already grateful, but would not dare to think about getting this one's chance ah.
<br><br>So, for a while they were more apprehensive in their hearts besides joy.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>What virtue and what ability they have.
<br><br>"Well, this time to find you guys over, is to talk about a matter."
<br><br>Yi Feng himself picked up a cup of tea and said as he savored it.
<br><br>The three people immediately sat upright.
<br><br>Knowing that the main thing to come, listen to listen.
<br><br>Looking at the attitude of the three people to talk about things, Yi Feng nodded his head satisfactorily and then said, "Just now you guys said, you are bricklayers, and you can also shout to a lot of people, and I happen to have a lot of houses to build in my hands, so I plan to contract you guys to help me build, what do you think?"
<br><br>At these words, the three looked at each other.
<br><br>It dawned on them.
<br><br>So this one, is want them to work for him.
<br><br>How could they not agree?
<br><br>Not to mention the construction of the house, even if it is here to take the dung also happy ah.
<br><br>What's more, Yi Feng's chance they have taken, they dare not refuse ah.
<br><br>Immediately, they cooperated with Yi Feng to discuss in detail the next matters.
<br><br>And what Yi Feng said, they also do not have half an opinion.
<br><br>"Really good, finalized a big thing, so cheap price to hire the construction team, save a large amount of money ah." Yi Feng felt quite satisfied in his heart.
<br><br>The more you look at these people, the better you see them.
<br><br>"Why don't you stay for dinner, I happen to have made a beef whip soup, I can't finish it myself, let's make up for it?" Yi Feng smiled and invited.
