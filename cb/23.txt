 "Good, today's meeting is not particularly big business." The old ancestor of Castle Peak sat at the top and resumed his majesty and said, "I just want to inform you that the old ancestor has received a high level of guidance and a precious sword, and my combat power has increased dramatically, so I can no longer fight with Xuanwu."
<br><br>The words of the old ancestor of Qingshan are full of springtime joy, and also sweep away the decadent look of the Qingshan Gate.
<br><br>"Heaven bless my Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>The crowd shouted.
<br><br>"So put your minds at ease!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan's loud voice spread throughout the room, "Do you all have any other matters to discuss, if not then let's disperse!"
<br><br>The people at the bottom looked at me, I looked at them, they all saw the same wish in each other's eyes.
<br><br>Finally, the eldest elder came out and respectfully said, "Old ancestor, can you let us see this precious sword."
<br><br>Along with his words, all the hopeful eyes focused over.
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan nodded, although he was not very reluctant, but so many people wanted to see it, it was not too good to refuse.
<br><br>"Then keep your eyes wide open and watch for me." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The words fell, the field was suddenly quiet.
<br><br>One by one, they held their breath and stared wide eyed.
<br><br>"Swish!"
<br><br>A ray of light lit up.
<br><br>In just an instant, Old Ancestor Qingshan put back his sword, with a self-satisfied smug smile on his face, and said leisurely, "How about that, see?"
<br><br>"Old ancestor ......"
<br><br>The faces of the people on the floor were suffocating.
<br><br>With that hand speed of the old ancestor of Castle Peak, they did not see anything except a beam of light.
<br><br>"All right, three elders you two stay, the others disperse!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan said with an impatient face.
<br><br>The crowd reluctantly left, leaving only the third elder with Yu Wujie two.
<br><br>"I don't know what is important for the old ancestor to keep the two of us?" The third elder asked respectfully, and in his heart he was expecting if the old ancestor was going to compensate him for something.
<br><br>"Destroyed your palace, hurt your disciple, the old ancestor I also have apologies, the clan also has nothing to compensate you, just make an exception to let you two more look at this sword!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan said rather atmospherically.
<br><br>The three elders' faces were ugly.
<br><br>But to have one more look at the sword, it is a kind of compensation.
<br><br>The old ancestor took the knife out again, but it lasted only a moment, but at least let the two see the real appearance of the knife.
<br><br>The two people could not imagine that the thing regarded as precious by the old ancestor of Castle Peak was actually a kitchen knife.
<br><br>Yes, a kitchen knife.
<br><br>However, the two people also really felt the strength of this kitchen knife, the harsh aura, the rich martial intent, all adequately represent that this is a supreme divine knife!
<br><br>Yu Wujie played it safe and used the burning jade slip to burn down the image given by this knife.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak just gave him one more look and did not say anything.
<br><br>After leaving the Castle Peak Hall, Yu Wujie headed for the outer gate, along the way there were many people secretly pointing at him, but due to his status, the general disciples did not dare to be too blatant.
<br><br>But even so, it made his face gloomy enough.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Jie, I heard that you were injured, how are you?"
<br><br>Finally, a silhouette in a long skirt walked towards Yu Wujie and sent out worried words.
<br><br>She was none other than Peng Ying, since she officially joined the Castle Peak Sect, her dress as well as her temperament had a qualitative improvement, and she had grown even more playful.
<br><br>"My eyes are really good, this posture, I'm afraid I can enter the top ten of the Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie's pale face flashed a sullen color, if Peng Ying did not have a good bottom, he, as a personal disciple of the elders, would not look at a mortal who does not even deserve to enter the Castle Peak Gate.
<br><br>After approaching Peng Ying, the sullen color disappeared from his face and he said gently, "Don't worry, I'm fine."
<br><br>"Look at your face so pale, and still say it's fine." Peng Ying was full of worry and asked in a soft voice, "By the way, what is going on, how did you get injured inside the sect."
<br><br>Peng Ying's question seemed to have stirred up bad memories for Yu Wujie.
<br><br>In shame, there was also fear.
<br><br>The moment that blade chopped down, he really thought he was dead.
<br><br>However, Yu Wujie quickly put away the fear on his face as soon as he said lightly: "The old ancestor got a treasure knife, the treasure knife is too strong, even he can't control it fully, and by mistake, not only did he chop off my master's palace, but also happened to chop at me ......"
<br><br>Peng Ying smiled, his face changed.
<br><br>Yu Wujie looked at her, sighed with emotion and said, "Speaking of which, catching this slash also wasted a lot of my effort, almost exhausting my bottom card, but I was still injured."
<br><br>Saying that, he looked at Peng Ying with an apologetic face, "Ying'er, I'm sorry, it's all my fault for being useless, I got hurt and made you worry."
<br><br>"How come?" Peng Ying nervously held Yu Wujie's palm and hurriedly comforted, "You were able to take the old ancestor's slash, this is simply a miracle, I'm afraid all the disciples inside couldn't do it!"
<br><br>"And what's the use, it's still injured." Yu Wujie shook his head sadly.
<br><br>"You're really strong, great." Peng Ying was busy saying.
<br><br>Yu Wujie's gaze strayed to her and asked, "Really?"
<br><br>"Really, you are the best in my heart." Peng Ying said solemnly.
<br><br>"Ying'er you are so nice." Yu Wu Jie said gently, palm gently moved, Peng Ying obediently was embraced by him into his arms, feeling the softness in his arms, the corner of Yu Wu Jie's mouth unconsciously raised.
<br><br>After some intimacy, Peng Ying curiously asked: "Right brother Wu Jie, the old ancestor that knife in the end is what knife ah, how can even he can not control."
<br><br>Yu Wujie narrowed his eyes, this time his face was not the slightest bit pretentious, and solemnly said, "This knife, it is indeed very scary."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Peng Ying raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>"You'll know at first glance."
<br><br>Yu Wujie waved his palm, a piece of jade brief appeared in his hand, as the jade brief emitted a leisurely light, a picture was presented in Peng Ying's eyes.
