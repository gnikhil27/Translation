The speed of a Martial Emperor was as terrifying as this.
<br><br>Soon, Ye Bei arrived at Pingjiang City and rushed towards the martial school according to the route remembered by Old Ancestor Qingshan.
<br><br>Then with a sweeping movement, he arrived at the entrance of the small martial arts school.
<br><br>Also at the same time, the skeleton head that was pressed under the well cover opened its mouth.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, the martial arts school underwent an invisible change, but no one could see exactly what had changed.
<br><br>Only after the change did the skeleton head smash its mouth and grind the well cover with its heavenly spirit cover in an attempt to grind it through and escape.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Do I really think I'm some kind of supreme expert, and talk about what martial intent is contained on the plaque?" Ye Bei's eyes surveyed the martial sign, and after observing it for a long time, he disdained to utter a voice.
<br><br>Where was there any martial intent on this signboard, it was clearly a signboard that was too ordinary to be ordinary.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he recklessly walked towards the front hall of the martial arts school. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>When he passed the steps, his footsteps beat, looking down at the threshold stone beneath his feet, he could not help but raise the corner of his mouth, "This person, indeed, is a bit interesting, but that's all, it's Qingshan, the old trash, who made up his own feelings, how this person's brain is so powerful, I see the probability, but also just a silver gun wax head!"
<br><br>With a cold laugh, he took a step into the front hall.
<br><br>When he first entered, he was still a bit wary.
<br><br>After all, the memories of the old ancestor of Castle Peak conveyed how powerful this front hall had eighteen paintings of divine weapons.
<br><br>But now, although the paintings are there.
<br><br>But there is no aura, much less fluctuations, except for posing to see, is nothing more than a scrap of paper.
<br><br>He has now determined that this so-called supreme expert, is only Lu Qingshan eyes, with some nonsense, brainstorming out of it.
<br><br>Of course, this person still has some of the bottom line.
<br><br>Just like that the door when the shock of the sky stone, also after all, is an imperial treasure, in addition to the old ancestor of Castle Peak that kitchen knife.
<br><br>However, this is more to Ye Bei's liking.
<br><br>"Since you want to pretend to be a god and make a broken martial arts school, then I will do as you wish and come to kick your school!"
<br><br>Ye Bei sneered, swept away and landed his foot on the drum in the middle of the front hall!
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>A deafening sound was heard throughout the martial arts hall.
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng was not there.
<br><br>Only Ao Qing, who was sleeping, was awakened by the sound of this drum and opened his eyes leisurely, glancing towards the front hall.
<br><br>It seems to be a martial emperor?
<br><br>Forget it, let's go back to sleep, anyway, it's another one to send to death.
<br><br>Yawning, the dog lay down on the ground in boredom and closed his eyes again.
<br><br>"Ka ka ka ka!"
<br><br>Under the well cover, the skull head continued to grind the well cover.
<br><br>It seems that the arrival of Ye Bei, sounded this drumbeat, but completely failed to break the half-hearted calm of this martial arts hall, the dog ignored.
<br><br>A drumbeat without half a movement, which made Ye Bei's face gloomy.
<br><br>He smashed his fist on it again.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Another sound that was even heavier than before came out.
<br><br>Only then did Yi Feng rush back from outside with a basket of spinach, shouting out of his mouth, "Coming, coming, what's the knocking?"
<br><br>When Yi Feng walked into the front hall, Ye Bei's gaze was cast abruptly.
<br><br>Up and down, he looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Sure enough, it was impossible to see through half of the cultivation level.
<br><br>But he was not surprised, after all, from the memory of the old ancestor of the green hill, he had expected it, the probability was that he had learned some kind of bizarre technique to pretend to be a god.
<br><br>"I know, you are the owner of this store." Ye Bei raised his eyes and said coldly and arrogantly, "I'm not here for anything else today, I'm here to kick the pavilion."
<br><br>"Kick the pavilion?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had thought there was some business, smiled, his brow furrowed, and his voice coldened, "Do you know, what is the nature of kicking the pavilion here?"
<br><br>"Of course I know."
<br><br>Ye Bei raised the corner of his mouth and said coldly and proudly, "Kicking the martial arts school must be divided into life and death, and the loser's martial arts school also changes ownership."
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>He was right, this was the rule of this world, and also the unwritten rule inside the martial arts school of this world.
<br><br>Therefore, in this world very few people kicked the museum!
<br><br>And he, too, encountered the first time since opening this martial arts school!
<br><br>"You go away, I don't want to fight with you." Yi Feng looked Ye Bei up and down and said without interest, "You are not my opponent."
<br><br>"You have a big mouth, don't you?"
<br><br>Being so belittled, Ye Bei's body showed a strong fierce intent and coldly said, "I'll tell you the truth, I came all the way here, and I'm going to kick your pavilion."
<br><br>At that, Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>Since it was a martial arts school, it must be mortals.
<br><br>Mortal fights, he has not brought afraid of, at least his mother is also 18 kung fu and God than, really think they are easy to bully?
<br><br>"Well, since you want to fight, let's accompany it!"
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng one hand holding a spinach basket, the other hand towards Ye Bei hooked.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Well, well, even the basket of vegetables do not put down, pretend to be quite decent, just wait a moment do not cry is."
<br><br>Seeing being so belittled, Ye Bei gritted his teeth.
<br><br>The last hand seal fell, containing all the dark energy of the Martial Emperor, and slapped over towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>This strike, he did not have any reservations.
<br><br>There is not the slightest element of probing, in order to hit Yi Feng with one blow.
<br><br>PS: Two more.
