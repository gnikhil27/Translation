"This ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng also became anxious for a while.
<br><br>Although, right, this trouble is this woman brought, but Yi Feng not only received her money, and before the fight against the mountain bandits, but also thanks to this woman it.
<br><br>What's more, this woman is now covering their escape, if a group of them really ran away, leaving a woman here waiting to die, even if they escaped, but also conscience can not rest ah!
<br><br>"Help is definitely to help her."
<br><br>Yi Feng tapped his temples, thinking: "But everyone should always remember that we are mortals, it is impossible to run directly over to fight."
<br><br>"Then what do you mean, sir?"
<br><br>Old man Wang asked cautiously.
<br><br>"Put a cold move on the outside without showing any traces!" Yi Feng said solemnly.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd instantly showed a knowing look and looked at each other unspokenly.
<br><br>Understand! First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Then they saw that Grand Master Wang raised his palm without showing any traces.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"Went off the deep end, how did I go off the deep end!?"
<br><br>The night meditation moon who was fighting with the woman in green suddenly changed his face.
<br><br>Then he saw that his body was emitting a ravaging aura, his forehead was exposed with veins and his forehead was swollen and red.
<br><br>"Bang ......"
<br><br>With an explosive sound, night meditation moon directly exploded and died!
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the woman in green and Han Xingfan simultaneously emitted unbelievable sounds.
<br><br>Obviously, this change of events had left them unresponsive.
<br><br>A martial king expert actually died from going off the rails and exploding his body in the middle of a fight?
<br><br>"Haha, what an evil reward for evil!"
<br><br>And after seeing this scene, Yi Feng was stunned for a moment, he also immediately emitted an excited voice.
<br><br>Seeing this appearance of the gentleman, old man Wang was very happy.
<br><br>It seemed that he did not speculate wrongly about the mind of the gentleman.
<br><br>"Hmph, Li Yihan, don't be too happy, if you want to clean you up, I alone will suffice!" Reacting, Han Xingfan flushed with a cold color and redirected his murderous gaze towards the woman in green.
<br><br>The woman in green frowned.
<br><br>Because Han Xingfan is not alarming, not to mention her current state is not good, her own realm is also inferior to Han Xingfan.
<br><br>"Xingfan Blade Technique!"
<br><br>During the battle, the long blade in Han Xingfan's hand changed.
<br><br>Countless blade maces appeared in the sky, and as he fiercely chopped his palm, the countless blade maces returned to one and became one, transforming into a smudge of materialized coldness that locked onto the woman in green and enveloped her.
<br><br>"Go to hell!"
<br><br>Han Xingfan sneered, his face carrying a strong killing intent as he closed in on the woman in green.
<br><br>The green-clothed woman's face changed greatly.
<br><br>With a miserable white face her feet retreated hastily, and a strong reluctance flowed in her eyes.
<br><br>Because this knife, has completely locked her, she can not dodge.
<br><br>And with her current strength, she simply can not block this knife, can only watch Han Xingfan Li her closer and closer.
<br><br>"Is it going to die?"
<br><br>The woman in green clothes eyes are full of the world's reluctance.
<br><br>In the nick of time, pork rong plucked off a chest hair cupped in his hand, a finger movement, popped out.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>It was to hear Han Xingfan scream miserably, towards the woman in green clothes speedily approaching him, his legs suddenly tripped together, his head directly knocked on the ground on the stone.
<br><br>Dead ......
<br><br>And his so-called Xingfan Blade Technique, along with his death, followed by the lack of power and did not break down.
<br><br>The woman in green was confused.
<br><br>Standing in place, looking at the corpse not far from her feet, covering her red lips shocked to the extreme.
<br><br>A Martial King expert actually tripped and fell to his death while fighting?
<br><br>What kind of thing is this?
<br><br>If it wasn't for the fact that Han Xingfan's corpse was right by her feet, as well as her own eyes so, she wouldn't believe that there would still be such a thing in the world.
<br><br>"Haha, there is reincarnation in heaven, evil people have evil retribution ah!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Yi Feng passed out a happy voice.
<br><br>And Pork Rong and Old Man Wang and the others also revealed heartfelt smiles.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>After a long, long time, the woman in green clothes then let out a sigh of relief and weakened in place.
<br><br>Looking back now, it still felt so surreal.
<br><br>At this crisis point, two enemies one went off the rails and one fell to his death, such unbelievable to exploding luck, really don't know how to say.
<br><br>After this episode, the convoy brought up the trip again.
<br><br>Nansha.
<br><br>Wind and Cloud Valley's main hall.
<br><br>With the Wind and Cloud Valley Master at the head, there were many experts sitting on either side, each with a mellow aura.
<br><br>"Xian Que, you are a great merit of my Wind and Cloud Valley, because of that senior's painting, father my cultivation level has gone up another level." Yun Haotian, the valley master of Feng Yun Valley, laughed.
<br><br>"Congratulations to the Valley Master!"
<br><br>Voices came out from the crowd at the bottom.
<br><br>"Congratulations father."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was also full of smiles, that day in Pingjiang City was really the best decision she had ever made in her life.
<br><br>"But that senior so great kindness, my Wind and Cloud Valley is bound to find the opportunity to repay ah!" Yun Haotian sighed.
<br><br>The rest of the senior people also agreed upon hearing this.
<br><br>With this painting, after they, the senior people, had enlightened it, the entire Wind and Cloud Valley's strength would be able to be raised by several steps.
<br><br>What's more, this kind of blessing was for thousands of generations, passing down from one generation to the next, there was no telling how much the Wind and Cloud Valley would benefit.
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>Just at this moment, the sound of an urgent report came from outside.
<br><br>"What's going on?" Yun Haotian asked.
<br><br>"Your Holiness, according to the scouts, that gentleman has entered the Nansha range!" The disciple said respectfully.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This statement instantly set off a thousand waves, and everyone present stood up.
<br><br>That gentleman.
<br><br>Actually came to Nansha.
<br><br>This was a big deal!
<br><br>"Listen to the order from the top of Wind and Cloud Valley, everyone follow me and set out to greet the gentleman!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>On this day, within the Wind and Cloud Valley, countless streams of light flashed, and many of the unearthly old men and women within the valley all came out of seclusion on this day and flew towards the outside of the Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>Also at the same time ......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Magic Sound Sect.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu watched the scouts below to report, face excited, can not help but tremble straight.
<br><br>That day buried the opportunity to let her nagging, even cultivation also suffered from the impression, today but learned that the one came to Nansha, which let her once again see the hope.
<br><br>"Disciple, set out with me quickly."
<br><br>......
<br><br>Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>"The painstaking search for that one has been no news, unexpectedly he himself came to Nansha, this time, absolutely can not let those other sects of waste first, this one's chance, is bound to be my Peng Xian'er."
<br><br>Under the veil, Peng Xian'er revealed a vow of conviction and led the experts to fly out of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Blowing Snow Mountain Villa.
<br><br>The fifth long air, the fifth formation heard this news is no exception, leading experts to fly out in unison.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Royal Sword Sect.
<br><br>Yang Tianyu sat at the top, listening to the scouts below to report, fell into a deep thought.
<br><br>Then said: "Gentlemen, due to the matter of the incense bag, we missed the fight for Jiang Yu's tomb in Pingjiang City, but it is rumored that there was a big change over there, and there was also a supreme expert, and now this supreme expert has come to our Nansha, what do you think?"
<br><br>"This expert has long been heard of, one strike to kill half-saint Jiang Yu, the strength is as terrifying as this, rumor has it that other sects have also gotten a lot of opportunities, and this time his arrival, the other sects have all moved." An elder came out and said, "So we missed out on Pingjiang City, we must not miss out on this one again."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>The others also agreed one after another.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>"Then all of you come out with me to meet this supreme master, even if the opportunity does not work, perhaps you can still get a little relationship with the high person, no matter how you look at it, it is a good thing that has a hundred benefits but no harm!"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu immediately shot, leading the experts in the door towards the edge of the South Sand to rush.
<br><br>......
<br><br>The edge of the South Sand.
<br><br>After a night's rest, the crowd had only relieved a lot of fatigue and was ready to continue their journey.
<br><br>However, the woman in green was on her knees in place, regulating her injuries.
<br><br>Despite the luck of escaping that day, the woman in green was also injured as a result, and did not get better for a long time.
<br><br>"Ahem, Miss Li Yihan, why hasn't this injury been healing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng packed his bag, looked at the woman in green sitting and said, "In my opinion, this is an external injury, you have to take care of the external injury first, and then come to adjust the rest!"
<br><br>"Sir is right."
<br><br>Old Wang Tau also said in agreement at the side.
<br><br>However, Li Yihan opened his eyes, shook his head and said, "I appreciate your kindness, but this injury of mine ...... forget it, you mortals do not understand."
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Old man Wang looked ugly, nodded his head should should: "Yes, we do not understand, sir even more do not understand ......"
<br><br>"Let's go!"
<br><br>A short time later, Li Yihan only tempered up, and the crowd resumed their journey.
<br><br>"Here, why has it suddenly become so lively?"
<br><br>Just a short distance away, it was found that frequently found a cultivator swept by, and even mid-air from time to time there are high energy crossed, this sound, so people who do not know thought that here to hold some kind of event.
<br><br>However, this is only the edge of the South Sand.
<br><br>Usually there are few people, such a scene is obviously not right.
<br><br>With vigilance, Li Yihan swept out and looked for a cultivator to inquire before returning to the carriage.
<br><br>"I've inquired."
<br><br>Li Yihan took a deep breath and said.
<br><br>At his words, Yi Feng and old man Wang and the others looked their eyes over.
<br><br>"Recently, an absolute big shot has come within the South Sand range, and these cultivators you have seen are just the tip of the iceberg."
<br><br>"In addition to that, people from Wind and Cloud Valley, Heavenly Sword Sect, Royal Sword Sect, Devil's Voice Sect, and Blowing Snow Villa will all rush here, and of course the purpose of all these people is to greet him or want to get on his good side."
<br><br>Li Yihan said with a solemn face: "So I have to solemnly caution you guys, it's best not to run around, and don't cause trouble everywhere, all stay honestly near the caravan."
<br><br>"Because in today's situation where there are so many experts, not to mention a few of you little mortals, even the strength of my Martial King is simply not enough, in case you bump into any expert, then no one can save you!"
