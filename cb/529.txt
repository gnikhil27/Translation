Yuan Jing's heart was filled with complexity.
<br><br>Her intestines were about to spin.
<br><br>The face was even more filled with dry heat.
<br><br>When she thought that Skeleton Ben Wei really did not know how to cultivate, she encouraged him in a long and serious way that if he worked hard, he would be able to do it.
<br><br>Looking back now, where did people need her encouragement?
<br><br>"Motherfucker, the dish is like shit, but also dare to force in front of this scum?"
<br><br>"What is this if not looking for death?"
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>The impatient voice came from the first seat of Bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>Then he fiercely turned his gaze, and looked at the dumbfounded White Collar Sky and Yuen Long Sky next to him.
<br><br>"What, you two trash are also ready to try?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I don't dare."
<br><br>The two were scared with a shudder and directly knelt on the ground in cold sweat.
<br><br>And the dumbfounded Yuan Jing saw the situation, beautiful eyes are also left look right look, do not know what to do she, also followed about to kneel down.
<br><br>"Oops, the beauty will not be needed."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei picture style suddenly changed, and hurriedly an arrow step over, grabbed the jade arm of Yuan Jing, emitted a gentle voice.
<br><br>Jing Yuan was quite flustered.
<br><br>Even though the two sides had a good relationship before and got along well, but after knowing the strength of Bone Ben Wei, she simply could not remain relaxed like the old days.
<br><br>Therefore, this action of Bone Ben Wei made her even more flattered.
<br><br>How can she be worthy of this kind of courtesy from an expert like Bone Ben Wei?
<br><br>"Lord, I ......"
<br><br>Yuan Jing swallowed and sputtered, full of panic.
<br><br>"Aiya Miss Yuan ah!"
<br><br>"You really don't have to worry about it."
<br><br>"A person as handsome as me is very pitying to drop."
<br><br>Seeing this panicked look of Yuan Jing, Bone Ben Wei gently stroked the back of Yuan Jing's hand with his hand and softly comforted.
<br><br>"Dog thing."
<br><br>"Be a salty hand again."
<br><br>Just then, along with a cursing sound, a tea bowl flew from afar and smashed directly on Bones Ben Wei's head.
<br><br>"Ouch!"
<br><br>"Master I was wrong."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei was smashed with hairy eyes, a miserable scream came out of his mouth, and his legs directly knelt on the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this, the dog and the milk dose on the side also fell to the ground with their legs.
<br><br>To know.
<br><br>This guy just got up!
<br><br>Still with the wake up breath.
<br><br>This situation they know, can not be provoked, admit fault as the top!
<br><br>This sudden scene, but the shocked Yuen Long Tian and White Collar Tian liver.
<br><br>What kind of person is ......
<br><br>actually dare a word, let the skeleton Ben Wei such a person directly kneel on the ground?
<br><br>Was it that one who came out?
<br><br>Thinking of this, the two people's breathing suddenly became rapid.
<br><br>The heart apprehension at the same time, the face flowing with tension, hands and feet is nowhere to rest, cold sweat on the forehead straight dripping.
<br><br>Yuan Jing is also clenching her red lips, no longer in front of Yi Feng's cheerful look, hands and feet at a loss to stand aside.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Under their gazing eyes.
<br><br>A white-robed figure walked out from the inner hall.
<br><br>With just a glance, they understood that this was definitely the mysterious gentleman Wu Tian Guojun was talking about.
<br><br>He looked dry and clean, with a dusty and unearthly temperament, as if he did not eat fire and smoke.
<br><br>At the same time, there was not the slightest aura fluctuation visible on his body, which matched perfectly with the description of the Wu Tian Guojun.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>White Leader Tian and Yuen Long Tian hastily moved their knees on the ground and faced towards Yi Feng with a respectful face, emitting a respectful voice.
<br><br>"Paying respects to me?"
<br><br>"Who are you guys?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a face full of confusion.
<br><br>"Enlighten me, sir."
<br><br>"I am Yuen Long Tian of the Yuan family, and I am Bai Collar Tian of the Bai family."
<br><br>The two men delivered respectful voices in unison.
<br><br>"Yuan family, Bai family?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned and turned his gaze to the shadow lying unconscious on the ground in the distance, and asked again, "Who is he again?"
<br><br>"Enlightened sir, that is ...... that is my subordinate Shadow, because of his eyes, that is why he was beaten like this by the one next to you sir."
<br><br>White Collar Sky explained in cold sweat, while looking his gaze towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng's pupils shrank.
<br><br>The White Family, isn't it the same White Family of Bai Qi Drain?
<br><br>Someone as smart as him instantly understood what was going on.
<br><br>So he directly sneered, "If I guessed correctly, because I injured your son, so you guys originally came to trouble me today?"
<br><br>"I dare not!"
<br><br>The two men knelt on the ground and kowtowed repeatedly.
<br><br>Yi Feng ignored them, but said to himself, "But you guys never thought that we were ironclad, and even you couldn't even beat my men?"
<br><br>"So you guys turned to your knees and begged for mercy?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hit the nail on the head, and the two of them blushed ugly, their faces rising to the color of pig liver.
<br><br>"What, speak up?"
<br><br>"Isn't your Bai family quite powerful?"
<br><br>Yi Feng does not give the slightest good face, that Bai Qiqu brutal unreasonable not to mention, now also bring people to beat the door, but also thieves spineless, this Bai family people a look is not a good thing.
<br><br>"Do not dare!"
<br><br>The two kneeled on the ground trembling and shaking.
<br><br>"Hmph, I really thought how powerful your Bai family is, even this mongrel waste next to me can not beat, trash into this bird, how do you still have the face to come to my door to find things?"
<br><br>Yi Feng continued to emit a mocking voice.
<br><br>It just so happens that he was also woken up and had no place to send his anger.
<br><br>The two people's faces twisted at the words.
<br><br>He said it as if there was someone in the whole Wu Tian Empire who could beat his so-called "waste of time".
