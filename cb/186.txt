Back in the cave mansion, Shaking Heavenly Que looked at Ye Bei, who had his cultivation blocked, from a high position.
<br><br>"You stay well in the cave, I will go down to the mountain with your Uncle Guan, and help you destroy the martial school that bullied you." Shaking Heavenly Que explained.
<br><br>"No way!"
<br><br>Ye Bei's face changed greatly and said, "Never, Master, you must not go, the people in that martial arts school are really strong!"
<br><br>"Hmph, my mind is already made up, you don't have to say anymore."
<br><br>Shake the sky Que said in a deep voice: "Even if the martial school you said is very strong, there is no need to be afraid at all, after all, I am going with your Uncle Guan this time, your Uncle Guan has recently got a great opportunity, already at the Martial Exaltation realm, so if there is really any accident, your Uncle Guan will step in to help."
<br><br>"Master, you listen to my advice, to there, even the Martial Dignity does not work ah!" Ye Bei advised in a serious tone, "Moreover, I will never tell you where the address of the martial arts school is."
<br><br>"Hmph, no need for you to say, I already knew it." Shake Tian Que coldly snorted.
<br><br>Ye Bei's face was shocked, "You, how do you know."
<br><br>"Your protective magic treasure has my breath, is afraid that you encounter any danger can not save you before the arrangement, so you have been to what place I know exactly." Shake the sky Que said.
<br><br>"What?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Ye Bei face ugly, he originally wanted to pinch the address of the martial arts school did not let go, but did not expect ......
<br><br>Without paying any more attention to Ye Bei, Shake Tian Que had already turned into a stream of light and left, then rejoined with Guan Yun Peng and prepared to set off towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Old man Tian Que, I'll coil you on top of the flying sword, you imperial sword to catch up!" Before leaving, Guan Yunpeng said towards Tian Que, "After all, I just broke through, my breath is still very unstable, I need to take a rest."
<br><br>"Okay, you adjust your rest."
<br><br>Shake the sky Que looked at Guan Yunpeng's breath of martial dwelling, envy filled his heart, for this journey is more urgent.
<br><br>If he can really mix some chances, then he can also break through the martial dwelling as he wishes.
<br><br>"But before I get to that senior, I need to go take care of a personal matter!" Shaking Heavenly Que said again.
<br><br>"What personal matter is so important that you must be in such a hurry to solve it?" Guan Yunpeng asked in disbelief.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, Shaking Heavenly Que's face sank and emitted anger, "That Pingjiang City has a few ungrateful things blackmailing my disciple, do you think I'm angry?"
<br><br>"So it is."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng nodded, and did not say anything more, after all, he also knew the stinky temper of Shake Heavenly Que, what he really wanted to do, no one can pull, not to mention the involvement of that precious disciple of his.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que remembered Ye Bei's various tensions, he also did not fall lightly, thought towards Guan Yunpeng said: "Listen to my apprentice said, these few people are quite strong, so really encountered unexpected trouble, but also trouble you together!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng slightly arrogant.
<br><br>Usually this old man Tian Que was frighteningly arrogant and never bowed down to others, but now he was saying this to him.
<br><br>It seems that Martial Dignity is just different.
<br><br>In front of great strength, even a person like Shake Tian Que who is lacking in tendons will open his mouth and beg.
<br><br>"Okay, there really is something you can't solve, I will help you out myself." So, where would Guan Yunpeng refuse to shake the sky que, slightly puffed out his chest full of arrogance and said.
<br><br>"Have a heart."
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que lowered his head, the light rose from the bottom of his feet, the long sword turned into three feet, and swept away towards the distance with the posture of a shooting star.
<br><br>And Guan Yunpeng, who was sitting on the imperial sword, also closed his eyes and began to calm his mind and meditate, solidifying his cultivation that had just entered Martial Dignity.
<br><br>Ten thousand miles away.
<br><br>With a Martial Zong cultivation, it would not take long to shake Tian Que.
<br><br>They left the evening of the previous day, and at this moment it was only the early morning of the following day, and the two of them had already arrived over the Martial Hall with their swords.
<br><br>"This is it."
<br><br>The angry voice that came from Shaking Heavenly Que as his eyes looked deadly at the small martial hall below.
<br><br>"Well, you go ahead and deal with it, I'll wait for you here, and I'll strike when I'm really needed."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng sitting in the air, a faint voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>But did not open his eyes, his mind is also on top of the cultivation.
<br><br>"Good, then old man Guan you will wait here for a moment, I will come after I go and destroy them."
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que put away his long sword, then swept towards the bottom and landed on a piece of wasteland behind the Martial Hall.
<br><br>The reason why he didn't land at the main entrance was that he was wary of alerting the snake.
<br><br>He also intended to take a good look at this martial arts school first.
<br><br>After a look, shake the sky Que dropped a lot of vigilance.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>There is nothing unusual.
<br><br>There is not the slightest breath not to mention, the scope of this martial arts hall also did not see any formation things.
<br><br>"Humph, pretending to be a god."
<br><br>"A group of curmudgeons, how dare they blackmail my disciple, obliterate under this sword of mine!"
<br><br>Holding his anger, Shaking Heavenly Que swept into the air.
<br><br>The moment he swept into the air, the aura of the peak of the Martial Sect was exposed, and with a tremor in his palm, the long sword in his hand trembled.
<br><br>Along with a compelling cold aura, the radiant sword dragged out a huge residual shadow in mid-air and chopped towards the martial school.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Shake the sky Que is intended to cut down this martial arts hall with one sword.
<br><br>Also at the same time, Guan Yunpeng, who was sitting high in the air, withdrew his mind from his cultivation.
<br><br>Because he thought about it, it wasn't good to let Shake Heavenly Que go alone.
<br><br>After all, the two are friends for thousands of years, he made this gesture inevitably look a little trustworthy, let people misunderstand that he broke through the martial dwelling and changed.
<br><br>In the said, condensed real cultivation when all can, and not bad this moment.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
<br><br>How some familiar?
<br><br>He looked down and scanned around, and immediately saw the small martial arts hall.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"It actually came to senior's place?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was slightly shocked, "I don't seem to have told Elder Tian Que's address to Elder, right, how did he come to Elder's place?"
<br><br>There was just a doubt in his heart when he seemed to notice something, and his eyes jumped violently.
<br><br>Hastily fixing his mind to look, he immediately found that Shake Tian Que had red eyes and raised the long sword in his hand and slashed towards the martial school.
<br><br>"Holy shit!"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's heart thumped, and his heart almost jumped out at this moment.
