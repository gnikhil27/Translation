Yun Sheng looked at the two leaving teachers and disciples with a complicated gaze.
<br><br>With a faint sigh, he then turned around and walked to the backyard.
<br><br>"Family Master."
<br><br>Seeing this, several maids saluted.
<br><br>"Where is Miss?" Yun Sheng asked.
<br><br>"Miss is inside." The maids answered.
<br><br>Yun Sheng nodded, and then pushed the door and walked into the room.
<br><br>In the room, there was a 13 or 14 year old girl sitting in the room, despite her age, she was well developed, her pretty face was long and delicate, in a few years, I'm afraid she would be another great beauty that would be captivating.
<br><br>However, she was red-eyed and did not say half a word.
<br><br>"Meng Tian, to my surprise, the little boy and his master that you had told me about, really came." Looking at his daughter, Yun Sheng exhaled a breath, and then said.
<br><br>At these words, Yun Mengtian's body trembled, looked fiercely at Yun Sheng, and hurriedly asked, "How could he really come, didn't I purposely ask my aunt to find a way to stop him at that time, how could he really come?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yun Mengtian's pretty face turned white and said in a panic, "What should we do, father, will he get involved in it?"
<br><br>For a time, Yun Mengtian was getting more and more anxious as she spoke, and her tears were about to fall down in anxiety.
<br><br>"I really shouldn't have provoked him at that time, obviously I was already deep in the mud, knowing that I couldn't be with him, yet I still wanted to provoke him, I really shouldn't have ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Sheng did not feel good in his heart and hurriedly explained, "It's my father's fault for not being able to protect you, but don't worry, they have already been driven out by me."
<br><br>"That's good, that's good ......"
<br><br>At these words, Yun Mengtian was not so excited this time.
<br><br>Yun Sheng sighed with emotion and said, "But I can see that the master and disciple are serious, to mortal body from Pingjiang City across ten thousand miles to come, and also take out 500,000 gold coins bride price, this heart ......"
<br><br>"But in the end, there is a destiny but no separation!"
<br><br>Said, he lowered his head, full of guilt.
<br><br>"Father, it's okay, I've resigned myself to my fate."
<br><br>Yun Mengtian lost his soul and said, "But is he really gone already, I'm really afraid he'll do something stupid."
<br><br>"Don't worry, I've already made it clear to them the importance of the matter, and also explained the power of the Yun family, they shouldn't do such a death-defying thing!" Yun Sheng said softly and comfortingly.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Yun Mengtian let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>However, inside the inn not far from the Yun family, Yi Feng's angry voice came out.
<br><br>"Rob."
<br><br>"Rob, it must be robbed!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's voice was extraordinarily firm.
<br><br>Although he is a mortal, but it does not mean that he does not have a warm-blooded heart, after all, people in this life, for what, for the sake of comfort.
<br><br>In his last life, he had to bow down because of life, he has had enough, he does not want to be like this in this life.
<br><br>As for the consequences, the hell with it, let's grab the people back first.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Although to snatch the bride, but Yi Feng is not completely ardent, certainly to do everything.
<br><br>The first time, Yi Feng sent Wu Yonghong out to inquire about that what Ye family news.
<br><br>Not long after, Wu Yonghong gathered the news back.
<br><br>"It seems that this Ye family is indeed okay!"
<br><br>Looking at the information of the Ye family, Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Because this family, apart from that Ye Tianzhi who was a junior captain in some sect, there were quite a few experts like Martial Masters and Grand Martial Masters in the family, and the most powerful one was already up to Martial Spirit.
<br><br>Although Yi Feng knows nothing about cultivation, but it sounds like it should be very powerful!
<br><br>In this case, I'm afraid it's really not something they can handle a few mortals ah.
<br><br>Thinking left and right, Yi Feng picked up the sound transmission jade slip and began to shake people.
<br><br>Because in this matter, he felt able to help is afraid that the group of fans.
<br><br>And Yang Tianhua and others who got the news rushed over almost as fast as possible.
<br><br>"How did you guys, come so quickly?" Yi Feng was full of surprise, the speed was so fast that he couldn't believe it.
<br><br>"Uh, we, we happened to be just over here for a tour."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, touring touring!"
<br><br>"Haha, what a coincidence."
<br><br>The crowd laughed awkwardly.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at this group of people, except for a coincidence, he didn't know what to say, then returned to the main topic and said, "Gentlemen, now I would like to ask you a favor."
<br><br>"Please speak, sir."
<br><br>All of them showed their excitement.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng was able to seek their help, it means that the gentleman is usually still able to think of them ah!
<br><br>This one after another, will become more and more familiar, one day the gentleman is happy, slightly reward them a little thing, it is enough for them to be used for life.
<br><br>"I'm going to steal a kiss."
<br><br>"I hope everyone can help a little!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a small voice.
<br><br>"Robbing a relative?"
<br><br>The crowd immediately exclaimed.
<br><br>"Shhh!"
<br><br>"Don't be so loud."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly put up a hand gesture.
<br><br>The crowd hurriedly silenced and cooperated with Yi Feng to lower their voices.
<br><br>Then, Yi Feng softly told them the ins and outs and stated his intention to rob the bride tomorrow, which immediately made Yang Tianyu and the others feel emotional.
<br><br>This big brother.
<br><br>He's really playing hard to get!
<br><br>This is not to invite them to role-play, as a dragon?
<br><br>However, they did not dare to pick on Yi Feng, the only way to cooperate was to pat their chests and promise Yi Feng.
<br><br>"It's good to have you fans."
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart was touched.
<br><br>"Should should should."
<br><br>The crowd has politely responded, and to get this word of approval from Yi Feng, not to mention how excited they are.
<br><br>"But there is a say ah everyone, you still have to think clearly, this thing, the danger is also quite a lot." Yi Feng then added: "I heard that they that Ye family but there is a martial spirit it, this cultivation should be very scary!"
<br><br>PS: overestimated himself, only get out five chapters, can not get seven chapters today, dizzy and can not hold up, the remaining two tomorrow to make up, tomorrow a total of five.
