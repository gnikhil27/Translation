After saying these words lightly, Yi Feng took a step forward.
<br><br>Facing these seven people, he never had any fear from the beginning.
<br><br>Because at the beginning, he directly used the system to detect the talent of these people, and the result was just seven trash.
<br><br>Garbage, Yi Feng has a number in his heart, and a few more are not afraid.
<br><br>If not, Yi Feng would have run away long ago, how could he stay here foolishly and wait for death?
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>However, the two young girls were instantly stunned on the spot.
<br><br>Things are not that serious?
<br><br>The one at the head was a Martial Emperor!
<br><br>Is this mortal's brain scared silly, or is he simply unable to distinguish the situation clearly?
<br><br>Seeing the two sisters' concerns fading, Yi Feng said softly and comfortingly, "You really don't have to worry much, it's just seven trash, even if you don't rush over, I can deal with them easily." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The two women were once again stunned by Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>They.
<br><br>You actually called it seven trash?
<br><br>For a while, the two women looked at Yi Feng as if they were looking at a fool, and even images had appeared in their minds of how miserable Yi Feng would die under these seven people.
<br><br>"Aiya Miss, look at you, said don't come, this is a person who is brain burnt, this time we may not really get away." The maid couldn't help but whisper a soft reproach in the young girl's ear.
<br><br>The young girl was also filled with a complicated face.
<br><br>Martial Emperor.
<br><br>Already the ceiling of the entire Immortal River Continent, he was actually called trash by this mortal.
<br><br>It really is how ignorant one has to be!
<br><br>And at this time, the black-clothed people have completely lost patience, also by Yi Feng's words completely to anger, one of them is already directly towards Yi Feng hands.
<br><br>The feet move, shrink into a ruler in the blink of an eye to the front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>A flip of the palm of the hand.
<br><br>A sharp claw attacked towards Yi Feng's neck, a sure kill blow.
<br><br>"So fast."
<br><br>"It's actually another Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>The two young girls cried out in shock, even they could not even see the movements of this man in black before they had already reached Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>This terrifying attack frightened them and made them blossom.
<br><br>They had already predicted the end of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because such a strike not to mention a mortal like Yi Feng, even the two of them were not even qualified to resist.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>However, an abrupt sound rang out.
<br><br>The two young girls inclined their heads and were surprised to find that Yi Feng pulled out a kitchen knife from his arms and cut on the neck of the man in black.
<br><br>The man in black fell to the ground in response to the sound, too dead to die.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This scene directly made the young girl cover her red lips and cry out in shock, the fact before her eyes hit her mind, causing her mind to go blank all of a sudden.
<br><br>That black-clothed Martial Emperor.
<br><br>Was actually, was actually hacked to death by this mortal, with a kitchen knife?
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>God!
<br><br>What the hell is going on?
<br><br>The young girl felt that she completely lost the ability to think.
<br><br>The remaining six black-clothed men also changed their faces, also revealing a strong look of disbelief.
<br><br>Their companions were actually killed by a single slash, and they couldn't even see how the slash actually went down.
<br><br>Especially the leader of the man, his eyes shrunk into a needle hole, staring deadly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>This person in front of him, indeed, does not have half a cultivation, but a knife cut his companion to death, what the hell is going on?
<br><br>It is really too bizarre!
<br><br>"You're so fucking slow, moving like a dog pounce, and you still want to kill me?"
<br><br>"Bah."
<br><br>Just when they were all in shock and couldn't help themselves, Yi Feng cursed viciously at the corpse on the ground, then raised the kitchen knife towards the six of them.
<br><br>"You six pussies, don't freeze, don't you want to rob me, come on, come on, together."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted arrogantly.
<br><br>Such a provocation made the six people gush out a monstrous anger.
<br><br>Companionship feud first, but actually so belittled them, is unbearable.
<br><br>What's more, the flame bead in Yi Feng's hand was also a must-have for them.
<br><br>The six people's aura was revealed, and the aura of Martial Emperor was shocked out.
<br><br>In this scene, the two people watching the battle next to the master and servant have long been under the power of the shock back.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>One person, palms with lightning speed to form a hand seal.
<br><br>With the hand seal together, invisible energy from behind him condensed, like a monstrous wave.
<br><br>Another person, palm together, the sky condensed a huge palm print, with a monstrous power to press down from the sky.
<br><br>In short, this moment the six people show their godly power, a variety of means have been cast out.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>A miserable scream suddenly sounded.
<br><br>It was to see, Yi Feng a knife cut over that knotted hand seal of the man in black, and he condensed the attack is also dissipated.
<br><br>"Hit the nimrod hand seal it, you are Naruto watch too much?"
<br><br>"Fancy."
<br><br>Between the words, another slash cut over another black man who had coalesced an attack.
