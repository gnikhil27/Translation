A mountain peak below.
<br><br>The old Taoist Lin Mo looked at the mountain peak that had been cut off a large part of its hardness in front of him and sweated coldly.
<br><br>"What's the matter, what's the matter with this?" <br><br>"What is the problem?" said Lin Mo Lao Dao, looking at the black-clothed woman carrying a sword next to him, and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Humph, this lady believed your evil and lowered herself to approach them."
<br><br>"This kind of brain-damaged-like behavior now that I look back, I was like a fool, making me want to find a crack in the ground."
<br><br>The more she said, the angrier she became, the longer the sword in her hand moved and whistled away.
<br><br>Suddenly, a dazzling sword light fell down again with a bang.
<br><br>The mountain peaks in front of her were like bean curd under this sword, directly falling off another piece, smashing down on the ground with a deafening sound.
<br><br>"I didn't come up with this solution, didn't you say you would solve it yourself?" Lin Mo Lao Dao said with an ugly face.
<br><br>"Then why didn't you stop me?"
<br><br>The woman in black raised her long sword and pointed it straight at Lin Mo Lao Dao. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I I I ......"
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao was in cold sweat, his paws hurriedly retreated, and his mouth hurriedly explained, "The main thing is that you swore at that time, and it's not good for me to stop you."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the woman in black only gave a cold snort and put down the long sword in her hand.
<br><br>Only then did old Taoist Lin Mo let out a sigh of relief and asked, "So what should you do next?"
<br><br>"Anyway, I won't do that kind of behavior before." The woman in black said in a deep voice, "Since softness won't work, I'll just expose my cultivation and reveal my identity in front of them."
<br><br>When she said that, the thunderous woman directly swept up in the air and disappeared in front of Lin Mo Lao Dao's eyes in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>On the other side.
<br><br>Yi Feng and the others were already at the foot of the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>Right at this moment, a whistling sound appeared in the sky.
<br><br>Easy Feng looked up and instantly found a woman in black flying.
<br><br>"Look, disciple, a cultivator."
<br><br>When he heard the words, Zhong Qing also hurriedly lifted his head up.
<br><br>For a moment, the eyes of both master and disciple showed envious eyes.
<br><br>However, what they did not expect was that the woman in black actually flew directly towards them and stayed above their heads, looking at them from above.
<br><br>Just when the two of them didn't know what was going on, the black-clothed woman looked at Yi Feng and spoke directly, saying, "I, Bai Lengxi of the Void Sect of the Eastern Victory Continent, am here today to take away your disciple."
<br><br>At this moment, the black-clothed woman was kind of open to the door, not to mention that she directly announced herself, and did not disguise herself again as before.
<br><br>After finishing her speech, she turned her gaze to Zhong Qing next to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Take away my disciple?"
<br><br>Easy Feng frowned and hastily clasped his fist and said, "Did my disciple commit something?"
<br><br>"That's not true, but today I must take him away."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi said, "But you can rest assured that I will never hurt him, in less than half a month, in more than two months, I will send him back, and no matter what happens in the end, I will send him some opportunities."
<br><br>But even after saying that, Yi Feng was still full of fog and disbelief.
<br><br>Suddenly, a flying practitioner came to take his disciple away, what kind of thing is this?
<br><br>You can say that his disciple is gifted by a high ranking person, but his disciple can't even enter the Castle Peak Gate, so he may be even more useless than him.
<br><br>Thinking about it, he couldn't help but ask, "Can I ask what's going on?"
<br><br>"There is no comment on what exactly it is, but with my status, I'm not so bad as to lie to a few of you mortals." Bai Lengxi said coldly.
<br><br>And while speaking, he was also gauging Yi Feng's expression and movements.
<br><br>In fact, it was also testing Yi Feng.
<br><br>After all, the attitude of that group of big shots in Nansha towards Yi Feng was in her eyes, and this was something that had been puzzling her.
<br><br>So she still took a cautious attitude and came to test and see, what if Yi Feng was really some kind of supreme master and she didn't see it?
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Easy Feng nodded in silence.
<br><br>By logic, there was really no need for such a cultivator to go to the trouble of deceiving him, a mortal.
<br><br>The reaction of Yi Feng was seen by Bai Lengxi in her eyes.
<br><br>She gave a cold laugh in her heart.
<br><br>Once again, it was confirmed that Yi Feng was really a mortal.
<br><br>Because even if he was pretending, in this situation, he couldn't be this appearance.
<br><br>"So, how is it?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi then asked.
<br><br>Easy Feng, on the other hand, turned his gaze to Zhong Qing and said, "Disciple, you decide for yourself."
<br><br>"What do you mean, Master?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing asked.
<br><br>"According to my meaning, it is fine for you to try."
<br><br>With a slight thought, Yi Feng said, "Because people really want to harm you, they really can't need to do so, so this time for you, there is indeed a possibility of opportunity."
<br><br>"And she also said that she will be back in two months at most, counting the time, at that time your master I just happen to be back to the martial school, just ask her to send you back to the martial school directly, you also save following me running around inside the mountain."
<br><br>Zhong Qing lowered her head and said, "Then I'll listen to you, Master."
<br><br>Yi Feng stroked his head, nodded and smiled.
<br><br>After all, he also knew that this child was still carrying a blood feud and had been trying to cultivate without hope, so if he could really get some chance this time, it might relieve him of a lot of pressure.
<br><br>"I'll go with you."
<br><br>"But you promise, two months at most, you send me back to my master's side." Zhong Qing looked up and said.
<br><br>"I promise."
<br><br>The gloom on Bai Lengxi's face finally dissipated.
<br><br>If she had known that this would come so smoothly, she would not have had to act like a fool to make the kind of idiotic behavior in the restaurant before.
<br><br>After a few moments, Bai Lengxi took Zhong Qing and swept away into the air.
<br><br>Before leaving, I saw that Bai Lengxi had deliberately put on a jacket for Zhong Qing to avoid the wind, so that Yi Feng confirmed that this woman really had no malice towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Perhaps, Zhong Qing's life will change ah.
<br><br>"Disciple, remember to think of my master!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>But Zhong Qing had long since disappeared.
<br><br>Looking at the direction he left, Yi Feng's heart was happy and a bit lost.
<br><br>Not only did his disciple have a wife, but perhaps he would be able to cultivate from now on.
<br><br>Looking at him as a master, not only is he a single dog, but he is still a small molehill at the bottom.
<br><br>Zing the heart!
