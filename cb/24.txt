 In the picture.
<br><br>It was showing Old Ancestor Qingshan holding out his sword in front of the Third Elder and Yu Wujie.
<br><br>Although only presented in the picture, but the moment the knife came out, the strong aura still scared Peng Ying opened his red lips.
<br><br>Under the intimidation, but also became pale.
<br><br>"Look, it's this knife." The picture is very short, and just that momentary time to be able to see the full appearance of that supreme divine knife, seize the moment Yu Wujie hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>"A kitchen knife?"
<br><br>When looking at the full picture, Peng Ying asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Yes, a kitchen knife." Yu Wujie said emotionally, "I don't know what the mentality of the predecessor who built this knife was, but it doesn't matter, what matters is that this knife is really strong, with this knife, I think the old ancestor and the Xuanwu old ancestor's battle is no longer under discussion."
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>Peng Ying nodded his head absentmindedly, seemingly thinking about something.
<br><br>"What's wrong Ying'er, is there something on your mind?" Yu Wujie asked in a soft voice in a hurry. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"No, I just feel ...... I just feel that this kitchen knife is very familiar, as if I have seen it somewhere." Peng Ying said.
<br><br>"Oops, don't think so much, you must be mistaken." Yu Wujie laughed: "This level to the old ancestor are treated like a treasure, how can you have seen it?"
<br><br>"Also right."
<br><br>Peng Ying also nodded, she also felt that rising out of this idea was quite unbelievable.
<br><br>"Alright, I will let you join the inner sect as soon as possible." Yu Wujie smoothly wrapped his arm around Peng Ying's small waist and said gently, "It's just that we still have to wait for a while, otherwise there will always be people gossiping."
<br><br>With a light twist of her waist, Peng Ying said gratefully, "Thank you, Brother Wujie, you are so kind."
<br><br>......
<br><br>Autumn was thick.
<br><br>Falling leaves covered the ground in a thick layer.
<br><br>Cold air also finally came, Yi Feng added clothes, even his recliner was covered with a blanket, but the heavy clothes still could not stop the wetness in the air.
<br><br>The bone-chilling cold made Yi Feng freeze into a dog.
<br><br>The good thing is that although he is lazy as an earthling, but really handy to make a layer of reflective iron to make a stove, and then the flame beads rested into it, relying on the reflection of the iron to emit heat, and immediately warmed Yi Feng's whole body.
<br><br>"Otherworldly version of the small sun, the world's only one, the key is not electricity."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corner of his mouth, his gaze opened to the street outside.
<br><br>Not far away, a small figure of a fallen, head down walked back.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed, it seemed that Zhong Qing was still not qualified enough to join the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>"Greetings, Master."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, handed him a smile and laughed: "It's cold, sit down and roast the fire!"
<br><br>"It's okay Master, I'll go and do two more sets of boxing, then cook the rice and pick the vegetables, and wait for you to cook." Zhong Qing said softly, and went towards the inner hall.
<br><br>Yi Feng let out a sigh.
<br><br>It was cold, and business had cooled down a lot.
<br><br>"It seems that I need to proceed to the next program." Yi Feng jerked the dog on one side and came to the desk.
<br><br>Lift the pen.
<br><br>The pen fell, and "The Supreme Treasure and the Purple Haze Fairy" had entered the rice paper.
<br><br>This is also Yi Feng can not help it, simply rely on the martial arts school is really some income is not enough, every winter he will write some stories, hoping to sell.
<br><br>The previous winter, he did write a "Dream of the Red Chamber", but I do not know whether the audience is too small or why, there is no accident flopped.
<br><br>This year he thought for a long time, or decided to write a book "Purple Haze Fairy and the Supreme Treasure", for a young man after 90 years on Earth, the love between the two still brought him a lot of feelings and emotions.
<br><br>This book, not looking for how many people read, occasionally some people buy, to improve his life has been satisfied.
<br><br>The good thing is that there is a chamber of commerce in Pingjiang City that he once helped, can help print some, help sell.
<br><br>The rice paper, filled with neat handwriting.
<br><br>"Cough!"
<br><br>Outside the door, there was a coughing sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng put down the paper and pencil, got up and came to the door, the corners of his mouth could not help but smile.
<br><br>Outside the door, it was an old man dressed in a straw raincoat, the old man had a sharp face, and a staggered scar next to the gutter nose.
<br><br>His surname is Wu, to say the least, this old man Wu is also considered an old friend of his.
<br><br>But in Yi Feng's opinion, this old man was not so normal.
<br><br>Every time he came to his place, he would stand outside the door and stare at the plaque of his martial arts school for half a day, and he didn't know what he was doing.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>This old man was staring again.
<br><br>"Man, long time no see." Only after a long time did the old man slow down and greeted Yi Feng.
<br><br>The corners of Yi Feng's mouth twitched.
<br><br>What age am I, what age do you old man do not have a number in your heart, always talk like a forgetful friend, I do not know which tendon this old man is wrong.
<br><br>But from the time they met, this old man Wu called him so, Yi Feng is also used to it, so also called him so.
<br><br>"Old Brother Wu, long time no see." Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>"Haha, man makes me admire ah." Looking at the well-dressed Yi Feng, a glint of shrewdness flashed in his eyes as he laughed, "We are the same kind of person, old brother Yi you are doing more extreme than me!"
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng froze, hard not to understand.
<br><br>On the contrary, the old man was used to windy words and did not care, shouting, "It's cold outside, do you want to come in and sit down?"
<br><br>Old man Wu nodded and came toward Yi Feng, and as usual did not enter Yi Feng's martial arts school, but sat down on the steps at the entrance.
<br><br>Seeming to know what he wanted to say, Yi Feng said one step faster: "Yes, yes, you are right, peeping into people's cave is a big taboo for us, so there is no need to be more formal between you and me!"
