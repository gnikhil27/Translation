Shadow Island.
<br><br>Amidst the violent sand and dust, a woman walked alone.
<br><br>The red dress, which should be as bright as fire, has been stained with yellow sand and turned into an earthy yellow.
<br><br>She bowed her back, stopping every two steps to catch her breath.
<br><br>Even though the whole person is exhausted, the inner cultivation is also eroded by the island's violent power, dying, a look of dying.
<br><br>But even so, the woman is still resilient.
<br><br>Each step, although slow, but sure.
<br><br>Wind and sand above a person will see everything in the eyes.
<br><br>This person is precisely Gong Chen.
<br><br>Because of Mr. Yi's instructions, these days he has been recruiting people above the Reincarnation realm on Shadow Island.
<br><br>And this woman in red, he has been following for some days. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Usually people in this environment, has long died.
<br><br>Even if you live like yourself, but also just find a slightly remote and safe place, hold your breath and sleep over, waiting to die.
<br><br>And she these days, she has not stopped walking, let alone waiting to die.
<br><br>A moment to the east to see the end, a moment to the Black Sea looking at the sea popped out of the devouring shadow fish contemplation, a moment to follow the wolf skin corpse looking for something.
<br><br>Gong Chen knew that she had been looking for a way out.
<br><br>Such a resilient woman really impressed Gong Chen.
<br><br>Even if it was as bad as the Shadow Island, where there were ten deaths, she had never given up hope.
<br><br>It's time.
<br><br>Looking at the woman slowly diving in the wind and sand, Gong Chen's body moved and flew down.
<br><br>The windstorm came, Jiang to raise his arm to block the sand, and when he lowered his hand, he saw the person standing in front of him.
<br><br>A shock.
<br><br>"Seniors?!" Jiang Zhi was overwhelmed with surprise.
<br><br>These days, Jiang Zhi had been looking for this person! This great power that could use his cultivation at will on Shadow Island!
<br><br>This was her only hope to get out!
<br><br>Gong Chen nodded his head and looked at Jiang Zhi with his back hand.
<br><br>"I wonder where you're heading to?" Gong Chen asked.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was a little embarrassed, "Forgive my junior's presumption, these days ...... have been chasing senior's trail."
<br><br>"Pursuing my trail?" Gong Chen raised an eyebrow and looked a little surprised, "For what?"
<br><br>Jiang to see that others are not disgusted by their own pursuit, relieved, confessed: "senior is the only one in this dark shadow island can not control cultivation at will to use."
<br><br>"Senior wants to leave this Dark Shadow Island, senior is the only hope."
<br><br>"You want to leave here?" Gong Chen asked knowingly.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi nodded firmly, "Yes."
<br><br>"Do you think you can leave?" Gong Chen asked rhetorically.
<br><br>Jiang to some hesitation, and then apprehension, "Senior is my only hope ......"
<br><br>Gong Chen smiled at his words. This was not denied.
<br><br>He looked at Jiang Zhi for a moment and said, "I have been observing you these days, and you have not let me down."
<br><br>"Only, I'm not the only hope." He said, "I'm not even the hope at all. If I could leave here, why would I still stay here?"
<br><br>He said, watching the light in Jiang Zhi's eyes slowly darken.
<br><br>Nor did he comfort.
<br><br>Just pointed to the Shadow Wolf corpses next to him, "Did you see that I was able to use my cultivation and thought that I killed those wolves?"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi nodded his head, even though he was hopeless, he still politely returned, "Senior is wise."
<br><br>"No wonder." Gong Chen smiled knowingly. No wonder she felt like she was her hope to get out.
<br><br>To be able to kill all the Dark Shadow Wolves on Dark Shadow Island, such strength was indeed worthy of being a hope.
<br><br>"You're wrong, these Dark Shadow Wolves weren't killed by me."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was surprised, and then the light in his eyes completely disappeared.
<br><br>"But you don't have to be disappointed." Gong Chen spoke with a waveless face, "Although I didn't kill them, they were killed by the lord I serve."
<br><br>"Not only that, I can do whatever I want on this island and use my cultivation because he gave me the ability to do so."
<br><br>"Although I can't be your hope to get out, he can."
<br><br>In an instant, the light in Jiang Zhi's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Crystal eyes looked towards Gong Chen, "Really?!"
<br><br>"Of course!" Gong Chen said with conviction, he was convinced of this.
<br><br>"My lord, not only can you enter and leave Dark Shadow Island at will, you can also dominate Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>"This airless island, where he lets life, there is life. Where he does not allow life, it is a place of death."
<br><br>With a few words, the light in Jiang Zhi's eyes turned into astonishment.
<br><br>What a formidable power she had inadvertently met!
<br><br>"I wonder ...... senior's lord, who is in the immortal world?" She asked cautiously. She was at least a figure on one side of the immortal world.
<br><br>The most famous figures and even legendary figures had more or less heard of their names.
<br><br>But the lord in this mouth, she could not think of any big brother that could match for a moment.
<br><br>"Humph." Gong Chen gave a disdainful hum from his nose, "Those are nothing. The Lord is an anonymous figure in the Immortal World. How can others hear about it at will?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, what senior said is extremely true." Jiang Zhi echoed, "The junior also really can't think of any name that can match it."
<br><br>But in his heart, he was in shock.
<br><br>Even the legendary and famous ones are not as good as this one on Shadow Island, so how powerful should this one be!
<br><br>Gong Chen looked at Jiang Zhi with satisfaction, "I came to find you this time precisely because of my lord's command."
<br><br>"He needs to recruit at least Reincarnation Realm people to work for him, and I have been observing you for some days. I can see that you are tough and of good character."
<br><br>"Would you like to follow my lord?" Gong Chen opened the door and stated his intention.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi looked at Gong Chen incredulously, elated!
<br><br>No wonder the clan's old man used the heavenly disk to calculate that her qi was rare for ten thousand years before, so here it was!
<br><br>I thought I was going to be buried in the Shadow Island, but I didn't expect to meet a chance of life here!
<br><br>It's really a village in the dark!
<br><br>"Of course I'm willing!" Jiang Zhi was so excited that he could hardly contain himself.
<br><br>This answer was obviously within Gong Chen's expectation, he didn't think anyone would refuse to serve the outrageously powerful master.
<br><br>"Good then, you come with me." Gong Chen was about to fly away with a leap.
<br><br>Remembering that Jiang Zhi was not able to use his cultivation, he turned his body and grabbed Jiang Zhi on the ground and flew away.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, the two had landed steadily in one place.
<br><br>Right in front of them was an ancient and simple courtyard.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was surprised.
<br><br>Following Gong Chen into the courtyard, Jiang Zhi's body stiffened, stunned.
<br><br>She had thought that that person was able to dominate the life and kill in the Shadow Island was powerful, but she did not expect to be able to build a dwelling independently in such a place without being eroded by the wind and sand.
<br><br>And ...... is a side of the independent world ......
<br><br>"You also feel the difference here, right?" Gong Chen smiled knowingly, "Did you feel your body repairing the moment you came in."
<br><br>Jiang to nod like garlic, excited voice trembled, "This is the former Lord created a side of the world? It seems that ...... even the air can have such an unbelievably thick healing power ......"
<br><br>Gong Chen nodded calmly, "If the Lord is in, he may reward you with a few grapes." He said, pointing to the backyard, "Those are not ordinary vegetables and fruits. With just one grape, you will not only be healed, but you will also be able to break through the bottleneck of your cultivation!"
<br><br>Jiang to listen to more incredulous, this ...... she had never heard of such a powerful existence! People or grapes, this side of the world is also.
<br><br>Just a hand planted out a grape, topped the immortal world top immortal pills!
<br><br>The most important thing is that you can get the most out of your life, and at the same time, you can also break through the bottleneck of your cultivation.
<br><br>Every bottleneck above a Heavenly Immortal in the Immortal World is extremely difficult to cross.
<br><br>Above the Xuan Xian, each turn, there are even more difficult and increasingly difficult to break through the bottleneck!
<br><br>Simply terrifying as ......
<br><br>While the two were talking, a man carrying a hoe came out of the courtyard, saw Gong Chen and Jiang to, and said hello.
<br><br>"Old Gong this is again for the Lord found the reincarnation realm above ah, the director came back and got a reward, congratulations ah!"
<br><br>"Not so, I wonder if it's another breakthrough." A fat woman carrying a basket next to him also laughed and echoed, "Old Gong is really lucky to have taken such a fat job."
<br><br>"Unlike us, we can only turn over the soil and weed, and do some picking work."
<br><br>Gong Chen also smiled in response, watched the two walk out, and turned back to Jiang Zhi, "The Lord is not here, I also do not have the courage to pick the backyard melons and fruits for you. Just stay here a little longer and let the injuries on your body repair for a while."
<br><br>"After it's repaired, you should leave. You can't stay here for long until the Lord returns."
<br><br>"Yes, yes." At this moment, Jiang Zhi is not only trembling with his tongue, but also with the tip of his heart.
<br><br>Because of the helplessness, because of apprehension, but also because of the excitement.
<br><br>Gong Chen continued, "After the Lord returns, I will give you news, and then you will come over to meet the Lord in person."
<br><br>"If the Lord agrees, you can stay."
<br><br>Hearing that, Jiang Zhi couldn't help but inquire, "I wonder when the Lord will return?"
<br><br>She didn't want to stay outside for a moment longer.
<br><br>"No one knows." Gong Chen was a bit dissatisfied when he saw Jiang Zhi ask this, "Is the Lord's trail something that outsiders can know at will?"
<br><br>"Yes." Jiang Zhi hurriedly bowed his head and admitted his mistake, "It was the junior who took the liberty, senior forgives me!"
<br><br>"That's all." Gong Chen waved his hand, "then wait for my news, during the period do not die in the dark shadow island is."
<br><br>"Senior don't worry, before the Lord returns, I will definitely live well." Jiang Zhi decisively returned.
<br><br>This time, what she met was not just the hope of getting out, but the great fortune in her entire immortal journey!
<br><br>No matter what, she had to seize it!
