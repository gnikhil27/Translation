"There's no need to say anything else."
<br><br>"I don't care what kind of person you are, you can't escape the blame for the death of thousands of disciples of my Sun Moon Sect."
<br><br>"Bind your hands and cooperate with our investigation!"
<br><br>Sima Zhen's flood bell-like voice came out.
<br><br>It was a direct ultimatum to Yi Feng.
<br><br>This caused Yi Feng to frown.
<br><br>"Have you checked the right and wrong causes before making this decision?" Yi Feng's forehead was vaguely blue and exposed, and he asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"This does not need you to worry about, all kinds of reasons we Sun Moon Sect will find out." Sima Zhen said in a deep voice: "After all, so many lives, now do not take you down, can not calm the people!"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"Good one pacify the hearts and minds."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed back in anger. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The laughter stopped and his face sank, "What if I say no?"
<br><br>"Then don't blame us for taking action ourselves!" Sima Zhen said in a deep voice, "I know you are good in strength, but please also think clearly, this is in the Sun Moon Sect!"
<br><br>As Sima Zhen's voice fell, the elder next to him was covered in immortal energy.
<br><br>Its threatening intent was self-evident.
<br><br>"Little bastard, fold your hands and be captured, you won't get away!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Guo Shijie also shouted from the side.
<br><br>"Hahahahahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>However, in the face of Sima Zhen and the others' threats, Yi Feng once again burst out laughing.
<br><br>The laughter was interspersed with disappointment.
<br><br>A thick disappointment.
<br><br>Was this the immortal cultivation he had been aspiring to since he crossed over?
<br><br>He originally imagined the life of immortal cultivation, but not at all like this ah!
<br><br>Perhaps there will be killings, there will be the seizure of treasures and killings, but can not also three or two immortal friends, wine and cheer, enjoy the world together?
<br><br>Perhaps there will be fighting, but more should not be a crisis before, together through the difficulties, hand in hand?
<br><br>Where is the passion?
<br><br>The immortal's spontaneity?
<br><br>The kind of travel between the world, not controlled by the mundane part of the transcendent world?
<br><br>To hell with the immortal!
<br><br>He sees only the mundane.
<br><br>In addition to a little strength, nothing.
<br><br>It's as if in the short days of the Xuantian Sect, he saw only the interests of fighting, only the deceitful, only blood, only killing, and the shameless posture of this group of Sun Moon Peak senior.
<br><br>"Dog system ah!"
<br><br>"I suddenly understand why I saw countless different me after you gave me a fifty level upgrade!"
<br><br>"This time, I'd like to thank you for the reminder!"
<br><br>"If I go on like this, I'm afraid I'll become as vulgar as them."
<br><br>"For the sake of profit, for the sake of the goal, for the sake of strength, do whatever it takes, right!"
<br><br>Thinking back, Yi Feng's heart couldn't help but rise up with a trace of fear.
<br><br>Before, he was already in the sink ......
<br><br>Became caught up in the killing.
<br><br>Caught up in the kind of vanity that comes with strength.
<br><br>Even when countless Star Peak disciples died because of him, he was surprisingly not too sad except for his anger.
<br><br>This had made him somewhat unrecognizable to himself.
<br><br>He ignored everyone and inclined his head to turn his gaze towards Liu Yan.
<br><br>"Peak Master, during this time, thank you for taking care of me!"
<br><br>Yi Feng bowed slightly.
<br><br>This caused Liu Yan's expression to be filled with consternation, biting her red lips tightly, her eyes containing tears, trembling and not knowing what to do.
<br><br>"Thank you also for taking care of the brothers and teachers."
<br><br>Yi Feng then favored the Star Peak's senior brothers and bowed his body.
<br><br>"Senior brother Yi Feng."
<br><br>"Don't you be like that."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"We are senior brothers!"
<br><br>"You don't have to be like this, this time it was totally Sun Moon Peak who wanted to kill you first, let's talk to the sect master and them together, it's totally fine ah!"
<br><br>Yang Yi and others red-eyed, anxiously shouted.
<br><br>Yi Feng was silent and just smiled faintly at them.
<br><br>Turn around.
<br><br>Looked towards the back of the mountain again.
<br><br>There, were countless Star Peak disciples who had lost their lives for him in the Grand Competition.
<br><br>One knee.
<br><br>Fell down with a bang.
<br><br>This fall, the heaven and earth invisible color change.
<br><br>There was even a constant commotion.
<br><br>"This one, this one is worthy of being the elder brother of Master Bones, worthy of being admired!"
<br><br>The three brothers of heaven and earth people's hearts and minds trembled, and could not help but give a thumbs up.
<br><br>But this kneeling.
<br><br>For Yi Feng, worth it!
<br><br>This is his conscience.
<br><br>This is his real Yi Feng!
<br><br>Although when they died, he was in the system upgrade and was totally unaware of everything that happened outside.
<br><br>But he could not escape the blame.
<br><br>"I will, later, seek justice for you all!"
<br><br>Yi Feng solemnly looked at the back of the mountain, slowly stood up and turned his gaze towards Sima Zhen.
<br><br>"I don't have the heart to argue with you guys about anything anymore!"
<br><br>"If you want to make a move, do it as soon as possible!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said flatly.
<br><br>"Good, then let me see if your strength is as big as your tone!"
<br><br>Sima Zhen's face sank.
<br><br>And the elders made a wink, and in a flash, dozens of Reincarnation Immortal Realm experts came out with a lot of means.
<br><br>The sky and the earth suddenly changed color.
<br><br>The immortal energy of various colors intertwined together and crushed the entire space into a vacuum before they could do anything.
<br><br>Countless disciples in the field have retreated.
<br><br>This powerful aura, even if they get a little bit of it, I'm afraid it will be ashes to ashes.
<br><br>"Peak Master, go, go!"
<br><br>Liu Yan, pulled by Yang Yi and the others, also retreated to the edge.
<br><br>Her eyes were red and covered with blood.
<br><br>In her heart, no matter what kind of person Yi Feng was, but it was her disciple of Star Peak.
<br><br>She remembered that when Yi Feng first arrived, he told her with a big grin that he would help her get Guo Shijie killed.
<br><br>Perhaps the two had not known each other long and their friendship was not deep, but when it really came to this moment, the feeling of powerlessness in front of her made it hard for Liu Yan to bear.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>The combined attack of dozens of elders wrapped up from all sides, enveloping towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>He, who was right in the center, bore the brunt of the various attacks, and was wrapped in a white robe hunting, and his long hair was even floating.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>He waved his palm, and the countless attacks that swept through him in the field were instantly turned into foam.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Impossible!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Sima Zhen and the others collectively stared in disbelief as unbelievable voices came out.
<br><br>But just as the sound came out, a powerful backlash came in.
<br><br>"Bang Bang Bang ......"
<br><br>Many elders were like a meteor, collectively flew backwards, smashing down countless buildings, without exception, fell to the ground with serious injuries, dying.
<br><br>And this scene, spread to the sight of countless spectator disciples, also instantly the whole field in an uproar.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"How is this possible?"
<br><br>"I can't be wrong!"
<br><br>"Him, how can he be so strong?"
<br><br>In the crowd, Liu Yan stared in disbelief, biting her red lips to death.
<br><br>On the other side, Guo Shijie was filled with fear, his body shaking violently and sweating coldly.
<br><br>"You, who the hell are you?"
<br><br>Sima Zhen was lying on the ground, blood spitting out of his mouth, filled with trepidation, and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng slightly raised his head and looked into the distant sky.
<br><br>Only after a long time did he say, "Just a mortal!"
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>Sima Zhen's eyes widened.
<br><br>In his heart, he couldn't help but curse out, "Fuck mortals.
<br><br>But even without the results, he still understood that Yi Feng was an existence that their Sun Moon Sect could not resist.
<br><br>Even if the heart is not willing.
<br><br>But already offended, can not be undone.
<br><br>More so, he knew that in front of this kind of person, it was meaningless to do any struggle.
<br><br>"Although still do not know your purpose, but my Sun Moon Clan knows itself inferior to you, there is nothing else to say."
<br><br>"If you want to kill or not, do as you wish!"
<br><br>"I only hope that the disciples under the sect, you can leave them alive!"
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>He closed his eyes.
<br><br>But after waiting for a long, long time, he found that Yi Feng didn't make a move on him at all.
<br><br>"Why are you?" He couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Since the beginning, I have little interest in you."
<br><br>"Even less need to make a fool of yourself that I would plot against you Sun Moon Peak."
<br><br>"You take care of yourself."
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at him indifferently, and a flat voice came out.
<br><br>Sima Zhen planted his head and nodded his head.
<br><br>Yi Feng slowly inclined his head and looked again at Liu Yan whose eyes were filled with tears.
<br><br>"What I have said, I fulfill at this moment."
<br><br>Saying that, he waved his palm.
<br><br>In the crowd, Guo Shijie, who was trembling and burrowing in the crowd trying to escape, was instantly grabbed by a mysterious force.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Help!"
<br><br>"Yi Feng Yi Feng, ah no, senior, I really did not mean to, I did not know that you are so powerful ah, if I had known ......"
<br><br>He shouted hysterically, his expression full of fear and despair.
<br><br>But the words have not yet fallen.
<br><br>It was cut off by Yi Feng's life, leaving only a corpse at Liu Yan's feet.
<br><br>Liu Yan looked at Guo Shijie's corpse at her feet, her red lips wriggled, and tears could not be restrained from sliding down.
<br><br>"Goodbye."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly at her, took out a pot of wine from the storage ring, turned around and walked slowly towards the bottom of the mountain.
<br><br>Strong wine down the throat, bitter mouth and sweet ......
<br><br>Tens of thousands of pairs of eyes.
<br><br>Just quietly watching, watching ......
<br><br>Until his back disappeared without a trace.
<br><br>PS: briefly say two sentences, although a little raw, but the overall satisfaction of the self, this period of time passed so that Yi Feng disgusted with the immortal life, is a sublimation, but also about the big picture of a change, he felt or his own salty time is good, the next will continue to bring you a quality plot, to give you a favorite Yi Feng and Bones.
