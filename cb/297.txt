"Come on!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said as he sat down.
<br><br>And Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian also came over.
<br><br>"Just one game!"
<br><br>After setting up the chess board, Yin Shengfu glanced at Yi Feng and added
<br><br>This remark.
<br><br>It made Yi Feng's stomach burn.
<br><br>However, did not say anything, but hand holding the chess pieces fell to the board.
<br><br>Everything, speak with strength!
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>Yin Shengfu's face showed impatience. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because he found that Yi Feng simply can't play chess, some of the pieces are simply without rules.
<br><br>This made his face more and more ugly.
<br><br>In his opinion, playing chess with Yi Feng is simply a waste of his time, it is better to play chess by deduction.
<br><br>If not for the face of Desolate Pathless and Meng Li Xian, with his temper I'm afraid he would have closed the chess board and left.
<br><br>And aside.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing and Meng Li Xian also found the problem.
<br><br>Although they are not proficient in chess, they still know a little bit about it.
<br><br>At this moment, they also saw that Yi Feng was a complete chess player, while Yin Shengfu was much more brilliant in both intention and layout.
<br><br>After discovering this scene, it immediately made the two people's faces a little nervous.
<br><br>Can't help but, the desolate pathless buttocks subconsciously moved towards Yin Shengfu, quietly transmitting voice: "Old man, Yi Yi is the main, you must give this old brother of mine a break, people just accompany you for entertainment, you don't let him face too much."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>However, in the face of Desolate Wujing's reminder, Yin Shengfu only coldly snorted in response.
<br><br>This made Desolate Wujing's face gloomy, secretly hating Yin Shengfu, an old man who did not understand the world and was unreasonable.
<br><br>But he also knew the temper of Yin Shengfu.
<br><br>If you ask him to let go in the game of chess or whatever, it would be more difficult than asking for his life.
<br><br>Therefore, they could only hope that Yi Feng could last a little longer in Yin Shengfu's hands, so that he would not lose too ugly and cause embarrassment.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What they didn't expect was that Yin Shengfu not only had no intention of letting go of the water, he was becoming more and more impatient about playing chess with Yi Feng.
<br><br>"At most, you can admit defeat yourself for another half a moment, otherwise I don't have so much time to waste on you." Yin Shengfu said with an expressionless face.
<br><br>"It won't take that long."
<br><br>"It will be right away."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with the same expressionless face, and at the same time as his voice fell, he put down the one piece in his hand.
<br><br>After the piece was set down.
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and left the board, and sat back down at the table again.
<br><br>"A little self-awareness."
<br><br>Yin Shengfu said with an expressionless face.
<br><br>He also did not expect Yi Feng to admit defeat so quickly, so his eyes also withdrew from the chess game.
<br><br>And seeing this, Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian looked embarrassed, although they had known that Yi Feng would lose, but they did not expect to lose so quickly.
<br><br>So, they hurriedly sat back next to Yi Feng and said with a smile, "Brother, it's okay, if you lose, you lose, just play chess, it's nothing."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Meng Li Xian also said with a smile, "Old man Yin's chess skill is really good, and he can't find an opponent in the whole city, so it's normal to lose in his hand."
<br><br>"Come, come, let's continue to drink."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian raised their cups towards Yi Feng at the same time, obviously wanting to help Yi Feng resolve the embarrassing atmosphere of losing.
<br><br>"Drinking is not a problem."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his cup and gently clinked it towards the two, then raised the corner of his mouth and said leisurely, "But, who said I lost?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian's faces were suddenly stagnant.
<br><br>After slowing down, they hurriedly turned their gazes back towards the chessboard.
<br><br>The expressionless Yin Shengfu, on the other hand, heard the sound and gently shook his head and snorted, not taking it seriously, but preparing to put away the chessboard.
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>He noticed something.
<br><br>The expressionless face changed violently.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Impossible, how is this possible?"
<br><br>He let out a startled cry, filled with extreme incredulity and shock, his body shaking violently, those reddened eyes, staring deadly at the chess pieces on the chessboard.
<br><br>Then, he hurriedly picked up the chess pieces and went over, wanting to continue the game just now.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>No matter how he dropped that chess piece, he could not drop it. Because no matter what, he was going to die.
<br><br>"How, how could this happen?"
