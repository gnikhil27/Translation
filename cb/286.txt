This caused Desolate Pathless to instantly change color.
<br><br>He had to know that there was a big killing formation in his neighborhood range.
<br><br>And the trouble level of this killing formation far exceeded his expectations. He had gone through many attempts in the time after the death of Firewalker and the others, but he was still helpless against this killing formation as well.
<br><br>And this kind of let him a martial emperor are afraid to move half a step of the killing formation, Yi Feng this mortal break in, that is certainly ten dead.
<br><br>In addition, this kind of killing formation can't be touched or seen, so Desolate Wu Jie hurriedly shouted: "Older brother, don't come over, there is a killing formation!"
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng opened his ears and shouted.
<br><br>"There is a killing formation!"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji shouted.
<br><br>"What needles?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted again. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"There's a killing formation!"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji's face became more anxious.
<br><br>"There is kill what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng still did not hear clearly.
<br><br>"Kill formation kill formation, kill formation ah!"
<br><br>Desolate WuJing is anxious stomping his feet.
<br><br>But still did not hear clearly Yi Feng, scratching his head.
<br><br>Just say a word, why so tired, just walk over it is not good.
<br><br>Thinking of this, did not care what Desolate Trail shouted, then directly towards him walked over.
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Desolate Trail's face sank.
<br><br>Secretly said finished.
<br><br>When he thought of how Yi Feng would soon die a miserable death under the killing formation, he had a painful look on his face.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was that Yi Feng went all the way through unhindered.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It immediately confused Desolate Pathless.
<br><br>Why was it like this?
<br><br>Why was this killing formation ineffective against Yi Feng?
<br><br>Could it be that Yi Feng's range is not yet in the killing formation, so it has not yet been triggered?
<br><br>But he just thought so when he was lost in thought, he suddenly found a face came up in front of him.
<br><br>It turns out that he was just lost in thought, Yi Feng has walked in front of him.
<br><br>Just see Yi Feng patted his shoulder, said: "Hey, what are you doing here, I can look for you, but you are also very smart, know that the fog will be lost, so stay here and wait!"
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Desolate pathless is shocked heart is going to jump out.
<br><br>Look at Yi Feng's gaze like seeing a ghost.
<br><br>If the place where Yi Feng had stepped before had not reached the killing array range, then at this moment, Yi Feng was standing in front of him, there was no way that he had not reached the killing array range yet.
<br><br>But, still unharmed?
<br><br>It's not that he was hoping for something to happen to Yi Feng, but he just couldn't figure it all out.
<br><br>Obviously he gently move a foot, there is a powerful array attack came, so that he, a martial emperor experts do not dare to move a step, but a mortal can travel unimpeded?
<br><br>This directly to the desolate pathless confused.
<br><br>This is completely illogical ah.
<br><br>Even Desolate Wuji recalled the small wooden sculpture just now, also assumed that Yi Feng is really some kind of super expert that he could not see through, but also still not valid ah.
<br><br>Because even the strongest super experts, will also touch the killing array to send an attack, at best, if the strength is strong, the face of the killing array attack can easily be put down.
<br><br>But right now, this killing array is completely ignored Yi Feng's existence ah.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>Horrified, he was just about to ask questions to Yi Feng, but found that Yi Feng with the dog has walked back a long way, while his voice shouted: "Old brother do not daze can go, with the dog in will not get lost, you have to hurry to follow ah!"
<br><br>Desolate pathless more confused.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng back hands, while walking, while his head towards the sky humming a little song appearance, he instantly felt that everything in front of him is so unreal.
<br><br>"Could it be that this killing formation had automatically disappeared when senior brother Yi Feng walked over?"
<br><br>He thought for a long time and could only find such an explanation.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he revealed a defensive stance and carefully stepped out a foot.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The killing formation had disappeared.
<br><br>So that was it.
<br><br>Desolate pathless breathed a sigh of relief, it seems that it really is Yi Feng walked when the killing formation just disappeared by itself.
<br><br>Although this is the first time in his life that this thing disappeared, but the matter in front of him can only be explained in this way.
<br><br>"Alas, this old brother of mine, is really the son of luck, before the small wooden sculpture saved my life not to mention, this killing formation disappeared just at the right time."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji sighed.
<br><br>Then he hurried up towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"How is it old brother, still haven't found that escort of yours?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing's gaze sank slightly and shook his head.
<br><br>This was obviously a killing game targeted at him by the five elements of chaos, even he, Desolate Wujing, had escaped only because of the small wooden sculpture sent by Yi Feng, and I was afraid that Yun Lang was really in a bad way.
<br><br>Thinking about the small wooden sculpture, Desolate Wujing pondered whether to tell Yi Feng about what just happened, whether to let Yi Feng know that the small wooden sculpture he sent saved his Desolate Wujing's life.
<br><br>"Aaah yo."
<br><br>"Ah ah yo."
<br><br>"Ah hiss de glo tie de glo tie de glo tie ......"
<br><br>But looking at Yi Feng with his hands behind his back, shaking his head and humming with a relaxed face that made him feel incoherent, he still terminated the idea.
<br><br>Because to tell what just happened to Yi Feng, this would mean that he would need to tell everything in full, including his Desolation Wuji cultivation and identity as well.
<br><br>First of all, regardless of whether such things would scare Yi Feng, he also needed to consider, after revealing his identity and cultivation, whether Yi Feng would still maintain this relationship with him to coexist as he does now?
<br><br>So he still chose not to say anything.
<br><br>As for that saving grace of the small wooden eagle, he secretly kept it in his heart and just find an opportunity to repay it.
<br><br>"Don't worry old man, your guard will be fine, maybe like you, afraid to get lost and stay where you are, when the fog clears he will come back himself." Yi Feng smiled and said comfortingly.
<br><br>"Let's hope so!"
<br><br>Desolate Trailless gave a strong smile.
<br><br>The truth is that what worries him most in his heart is not Yun Lang, but another unseen character.
<br><br>Shui Xing.
<br><br>A woman that made even him, Desolate Wuji, feel terrified.
<br><br>He asked himself, there are not many people in the entire land of chaos to fear, but this Shui Xing is definitely one.
<br><br>To exaggerate, if not for his identity, he saw this woman would like to go around.
<br><br>And with the five elements of the style of action, since the fire line three in this mountain, then the water line, must also be in this mountain!
