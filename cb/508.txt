After Teng Xiyuan returned to the Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>The first thing he did was to get on good terms with the rest of the Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>He completely tore off his hypocritical mask and treated others sincerely, making friends with each and every one of them, not sparing any of them.
<br><br>Because he understood.
<br><br>Only by doing so, others trust you enough, and when there are traces, you will be able to get information from them.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>Ben is in the blue immortal pillar, plus he is sincere to people, a time clues are not found, but good friends are really made a lot.
<br><br>One day after half a month.
<br><br>Finally someone came and found him.
<br><br>"Teng Xi Yuan brother." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Brother Yuan Cheng."
<br><br>"Brother Teng, although we have not known each other for a long time, but as soon as we met, I have long treated you as my best friend in my heart, so now I have a good thing I want to share with you to share, I wonder if you have that will?" Teng Xiyuan's best friend Yuan Cheng said.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"What good thing is it?" Teng Xiyuan asked in a hurry.
<br><br>Yuan Cheng's eyes looked around and saw that no one was paying attention, then he continued to transmit his voice: "Brother Teng, do you know why everyone else in this Chaos Hall, has left no?"
<br><br>"This, do you know?" Teng Xiyuan asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"Not bad, I also just got the news yesterday." Yuan Cheng said, "I also learned about it through a good friend, it turns out that they have additionally found a good place, that place is full of experts, immortal treasures are everywhere, and there are also super-powerful people sitting in the town, the rest have gone to join him."
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan's eyes snapped up.
<br><br>Secretly, he said that he really did not waste his efforts.
<br><br>This was the moment to finally find a clue.
<br><br>However, Teng Xiyuan did not move his voice, but asked suspiciously, "What place is so powerful, really?"
<br><br>"I don't know if it's true or not, this is also what my best friend told me, but so many people have already gone, I also want to try my luck." Yuan Cheng said, "And remembering brother Teng's person, so I also told brother Teng about this matter, just do not know if brother Teng is willing to go with me to see?"
<br><br>"Good, since Brother Yuan Cheng said this place is so evil, then I will go with Brother Yuan to have a look." Teng Xiyuan's heart was stupidly excited.
<br><br>A smile even spread across his face.
<br><br>This time, I think I will be able to find out the strange tentacle behind it completely.
<br><br>And when the Hundun Hall crowd knew that Teng Xiyuan was leaving, they all got up and asked.
<br><br>"Where is Brother Teng going this time?"
<br><br>"Yes, Brother Teng."
<br><br>"Could it be that there is something important?"
<br><br>The caring voices of the crowd came.
<br><br>"No, no, no, everyone is worrying too much, I just have some personal matters to do outside, I will be back in a couple of days." Teng Xiyuan hurriedly arch his hand and smiled.
<br><br>"Private matters? Brother Teng, are your private matters troublesome?"
<br><br>"Yes, do you need our help?"
<br><br>"If you need help, just say the word, we can all go and help you."
<br><br>"Brother Teng is a person of integrity, usually take care of us, although we have not known each other for a long time, but we have long regarded Brother Teng as a good friend, if Brother Teng really has something, don't be afraid of trouble, just tell us."
<br><br>A time, the crowd is again towards Teng Xiyuan out of various inquiries and caring voice.
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>Even for Teng Xiyuan, a guy with a bad stomach, also felt warm.
<br><br>Come to think of it, not being a bad guy, being a good guy to make friends widely seems to be a good choice!
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan went away.
<br><br>Followed by Yuan Cheng went towards the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>This time only two people went.
<br><br>Because Yuan Cheng's friends are not many, just three or two, the only friends left in the Chaos Hall, even Teng Xiyuan this one.
<br><br>Soon after.
<br><br>Two people have arrived not far from the island.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan's pupils suddenly shrank.
<br><br>"This time even if it is a tiger's den, I Teng Xiyuan must break in today."
<br><br>"I want to see, what is hidden on this island."
<br><br>"Lord Perdition, please also feel free to rest assured!"
<br><br>"I will definitely help you to investigate this island thoroughly!"
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan followed Yuan Cheng onto the island.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, welcome to the island."
<br><br>"I wonder what the two of you call yourselves."
<br><br>"Oh, this is my good friend Yuan Cheng."
<br><br>"This is my good friend Teng Xiyuan."
<br><br>"So it's brother Yuan, brother Teng, haha welcome welcome, you and I are both discerning people, we'll be family from now on."
<br><br>Once on the island, the two were treated with great hospitality.
<br><br>Because the group of people who came over from the Chaos Hall had formed a small group on the island long ago.
<br><br>The group was not trying to make something happen.
<br><br>Just from the same place, naturally more affectionate.
<br><br>This enthusiasm, so that would like to act alone, a good look at the island of Teng Xiyuan also embarrassed, have also made friends with the group of people on the island.
<br><br>This drink.
<br><br>Fart fire.
<br><br>It was a night.
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>He finally knew the general information about the island, and inside there is a heaven and earth door.
<br><br>"Initially mapped out this island!"
<br><br>"There are indeed many experts, and a Heaven and Earth Gate."
<br><br>"I must go back to report this matter to the lord as soon as possible."
<br><br>But he was just about to break away from the island and go back to report the letter, when he was pulled halfway to drink again.
<br><br>"It's not that I want to stay on this island, it's just that the hospitality is hard to refuse, so why don't we go back tomorrow and tell Lord Exterminator a day later, it won't affect the big picture."
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan thought so, and went to drink with the others.
<br><br>After another night of drinking.
<br><br>The next day early in the morning.
<br><br>Someone again enthusiastically pulled him to pick up rags.
<br><br>"This group of people are so fanatical about picking up rags, so they must have a hidden agenda."
<br><br>"Lord Perdition, I'll go back one more day later, to know myself and my enemy in order to be able to cut down the white."
<br><br>Thinking like this, Teng Xiyuan moved with the others again.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He ga found that picking up rags broke through on the first day.
<br><br>Then picked up seven consecutive days.
<br><br>Seven days down.
<br><br>He found out that this island was even more terrifying than imagined!!!
<br><br>It was simply astonishing.
<br><br>"This kind of enemy, if we don't tell Lord Perdition as soon as possible, there will be big things!"
<br><br>"But, pick up the rags for another day!"
<br><br>"I improve more strength, but also can better serve you, Lord Exterminator!"
