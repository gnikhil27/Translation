"What did you just say?" Yi Feng asked with a black face.
<br><br>Guo Shijie looked askance at Yi Feng out of the corner of his eyes, not even bothering to look at him more.
<br><br>Seeing Liu Yan talking so seriously, he almost took it seriously and was startled. As a result, seeing that it was the human immortal cub from before, he immediately settled down.
<br><br>"A trash Human Immortal like you would not have even been qualified to enter the Sun Moon Sect's mountain gate."
<br><br>"And presume to practice the One Thought Finger between one ye?" Guo Shijie said, looking back at Liu Yan, "Only Star Peak can recruit in such a waste of talent."
<br><br>Liu Yan did not deny it and only said, "What my disciple asked just now, Peak Master Guo has not yet answered."
<br><br>"If it is my disciple, practiced a thought finger, Guo peak master on the spot to eat what came?"
<br><br>"Nothing!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie's face darkened and drank in a deep voice.
<br><br>He lost his mouth to deny is not that he is afraid, just that he as a hall a peak master, such words are really disgraceful, just now also just a moment of quick tongue.
<br><br>"However, this waste of your Star Peak, really refine a thought finger, I hold this intermediate level immortal sword will be given to you." He then added. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Liu Yan's beautiful eyes picked up, and her gaze went to the green blade in his hand.
<br><br>"However, I also have a request."
<br><br>"If this Human Immortal doesn't have this ability, how about Peak Master Liu personally admitting that your Star Peak is trash?" Guo Shijie sneered.
<br><br>Liu Yan frowned in silence.
<br><br>"What, Peak Master Liu is afraid?" Guo Shijie sneered, "If you're afraid, just say so, why try to be strong, what is your Star Peak like, in fact, everyone knows it very well."
<br><br>Guo Shijie's words made Liu Yan feel blue and red for a while.
<br><br>If she really let her say such things, then she would lose all her face.
<br><br>But if she didn't, it would be the same as admitting that she had just lied.
<br><br>After all, it was she who swore that Yi Feng had practiced the One Mind Finger in one night.
<br><br>So, maybe Guo Shijie will use it to make some kind of article.
<br><br>She couldn't help but look at Yi Feng at the side.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded solemnly towards her and walked out on his own.
<br><br>"That statement just now by Peak Master Guo, can it be true?"
<br><br>"I am the Sun Moon Peak Master, a word is a promise!" Guo Shijie said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corner of his mouth, then laughed: "But the bet is not big enough, it has to be added plus."
<br><br>The moment these words fell.
<br><br>It made both Liu Yan and Guo Shijie next to him raise their eyes.
<br><br>"If I win, not only will you have to bring that sword, you will also have to personally admit that your Sun Moon Peak is trash."
<br><br>"Of course, if you win, my star peak master also similarly admitted that star peak is garbage outside, and you can take my little life."
<br><br>Yi Feng said leisurely.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Liu Yan's face changed and wanted to stop Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng, however, waved his palm and threw a reassuring look at her.
<br><br>"Good boy, have the guts, I promise you."
<br><br>Guo Shijie spoke out coldly.
<br><br>I thought I was the one who should be arrogant, but I didn't expect the little brat in front of me to look even more arrogant than myself!
<br><br>It is intolerable.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped his palm with a slap.
<br><br>"However, I don't believe in your oath."
<br><br>"I said a promise."
<br><br>"But pull back." Yi Feng rudely interrupted Guo Shijie's words and said directly, "Who knows if it's bullshit. I want you to make an oath."
<br><br>"Make an oath?" Guo Shijie frowned.
<br><br>"Yes, make an oath with your Sun Moon Sect's qi and your cultivation, if you don't respect the bet, the Gods of Heaven will descend on you." Yi Feng slowly and methodically said the most ruthless words.
<br><br>Guo Shijie heard his scalp explode.
<br><br>What a ruthless person!
<br><br>How dare he make such a ruthless vow!
<br><br>"You poisonous boy!"
<br><br>"What's wrong, shouldn't Peak Master Guo dare not?" Yi Feng's eyes twinkled as he looked at Guo Shijie in a good-natured manner, "Could it be that Peak Master Guo didn't intend to abide by it in the first place?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart, "Fine, I will stand!"
<br><br>"Anyway, I'll take your little life later!"
<br><br>After saying that, he didn't wait for Yi Feng's answer, he turned around and made a vow to the sky with a firm hand.
<br><br>At this time, Star Peak has long gathered many elders in the peak.
<br><br>One is because the Sun and Moon Peak Lord Guo Shijie and Star Peak Lord Liu Yan has long been at odds, this time deliberately come to many Star Peak elders afraid Guo Shijie is to find trouble, have rushed over.
<br><br>The second is to hear that the peak of the peak actually came out of a ye between the practice of a nimble finger descendants, stunned at the same time all rushed over to take a look.
<br><br>At this time all saw the hustle and bustle here, as well as Guo peak master's oath.
<br><br>All of them were shocked.
<br><br>The next moment, they watched a young man come out of the hall, look this way, then look over.
<br><br>Where to point?
<br><br>Yi Feng dragged his hand on his chin in thought, and then his gaze looked in the direction of Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>"Are you really sure?"
<br><br>Liu Yan followed out from behind and couldn't help but open his mouth to ask.
<br><br>This oath ...... is also too ruthless.
<br><br>She Star Peak and Sun and Moon Peak had always been at odds, but never to the point of vowing to make a bet.
<br><br>But she also thought well, Yi Feng this move how is for her Star Peak, if the bet fails, say what also to keep Yi Feng's life.
<br><br>Guo Shijie, who came out at the back, saw Liu Yan's face of apprehension, also heard her inquiry, and then his heart became more secure.
<br><br>A look of victory in the hands of the model.
<br><br>Strutting towards Yi Feng, "Young people, high-minded, can't see others look down on them, it's normal. Just admit that you are a waste."
<br><br>"It's just that most people don't admit their mediocrity. As for the waste, even more will not admit that they are waste."
<br><br>"But the waste still has to pretend to act like a big shot when it comes to talent, it deserves to die."
<br><br>"Hahahaha!!!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie said and laughed upward, heading towards the Sun Moon Sect's martial arts training ground.
