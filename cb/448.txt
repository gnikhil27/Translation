Far away, ten miles away.
<br><br>Space flickers.
<br><br>A figure in white jumped out of space and then fell to the ground.
<br><br>She was in a mess, breathing heavily and sharply, staring into the distance with cold sweat.
<br><br>"I just, actually got killed!"
<br><br>A strong look of fear passed through her eyes.
<br><br>Then she stretched out her white arm and stared deadly at ......
<br><br>On the arm, there were three runes that flickered with a lingering red light, and one of them, at this moment, had become dull.
<br><br>Seeing this, she revealed a monstrous hatred, her face full of malice.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>The black-robed man with auspicious clouds gradually withdrew his palm. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Turned back to look at the statue behind him.
<br><br>At this moment the statue light has dimmed, if you look carefully, you will find that it has been covered with tiny cracks.
<br><br>The meaningful glance in the distance, the auspicious clouds black-robed man slightly hesitant, finally is walking back to the statue.
<br><br>The light disappeared.
<br><br>Restored to become a small, plain wooden statue.
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Night energy and the four patriarchs and others breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>This battle.
<br><br>Finally, it ended with the fall of Bai Shouyi and the others.
<br><br>Even though the truth was happening right before their eyes, they still had a dreamlike feeling.
<br><br>Who would have thought.
<br><br>That unbeatable Bai Shanyi, just like that died.
<br><br>Qingniu clan.
<br><br>Yun Mai was painting, Wu Chang'an was drawing talismans, and Yi Feng was carving the trinket in his hand with a carving knife.
<br><br>Lightly blowing a breath, wood chips streaked, a delicate little person out of the fall out.
<br><br>"It's really lifelike!"
<br><br>Yi Feng fiddled with the wooden carving in his hands, could not help but feel.
<br><br>And so many skills, but also this carving let Yi Feng quite like, this is not, have nothing to carve two, so long accumulation, his ring of space is actually stored in several hundred.
<br><br>There are anime characters from previous lives ......
<br><br>For example, Xiao Mai gave his mother that wooden carving matching the dawn organization personnel, he has a whole set.
<br><br>Pirates world of the Straw Hat people, the four emperors ......
<br><br>There are also familiar mythological characters in previous lives, the four Western teachers and disciples, Yang Jian Nezha Li Tian Wang ......
<br><br>There are also the seven brothers of the gourd children, and the first to last generation of Ultraman, etc. ......
<br><br>Therefore, among the hundreds of carvings, there are all kinds of characters.
<br><br>"This stay on the body also useless ah."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at this pile of statues, quite a headache.
<br><br>Throw it away.
<br><br>Waste.
<br><br>Do not throw it, it can only take up space to save.
<br><br>However, at this moment Yi Feng glanced at the next serious drawing Xiaodai, but thought of a good way.
<br><br>Xiao Mai's parents do not open a grocery store, and incidentally sell some of her mother's homemade handicrafts?
<br><br>He can give these statues directly to Xiaodai's parents, placed inside the store to sell ah.
<br><br>In this way, it can also give Xiaodai's parents to supplement a little bit of home life, Xiaodai with their own go, but also be able to be quite solid.
<br><br>"Chang'an ah!"
<br><br>This period of contact, Yi Feng also know Wu Changan's real name, for which Yi Feng also did not feel unusual.
<br><br>"Master I am."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an respectfully beside Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Please run an errand and send these statues to Baier City for me."
<br><br>Yi Feng found a sack, put all the wooden carvings in the sack and threw it to Wu Chang'an.
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an took the sack and walked out of the Qingniu Sect.
<br><br>After walking out of the Green Ox Sect, Wu Chang'an looked up at the aftermath of the battle that had just calmed down in Baier City, and his pupils shrank slightly.
<br><br>"I don't know what exactly Master told me to send so many statues to Baier City for."
<br><br>"But I believe Master has Master's own arrangements, we'll know once we go."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an carried the sack, took a step into the air, and flew towards Baier City.
<br><br>Baier City.
<br><br>Night Energy and the others were still cleaning up the battlefield, looking at the three inhuman bodies in the ruins, they were still a bit incredulous.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>However, at this time, a cold mane came out from the sky and forced the wooden sculpture placed on the counter of that small store.
<br><br>It seemed to feel the crisis.
<br><br>The wooden sculpture trembled slightly, and the light was about to rise, but the cracks in the wooden sculpture itself were getting more and more.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>Finally, the sword light finally landed on top of the wooden sculpture before it showed its power.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Hard to resist this blow, the wooden sculpture lasted for two breaths, and finally the back strength was not enough, and was obliterated into powder by this sword.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>"This wooden sculpture is no big deal, it was powerful before, but it's just an expendable item, after its power is consumed, it's just a trash thing that can be slaughtered!"
<br><br>See the wood carving into powder, a face full of cold white woman, stepping in mid-air came out a cold laughter.
<br><br>And it is to perceive the wood carving power cut, white shallow one this just dare to re-fold back.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Due to the change is too fast, resulting in the night can and others only at this moment to react, looking at the wooden sculpture turned into powder heart suddenly sank.
<br><br>Mr. teach the little dance girl's statue.
<br><br>It actually cracked!
<br><br>And then look at the woman in white, the face is a big change.
<br><br>"White, white shallow one, you are not dead, how can you?"
<br><br>Night can panic, said, and his eyes could not help but glance at the corpse next to him, this foot is clearly the corpse of Bai Shanyi!
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"As the divine daughter of Bai Yang True Palace, do I really think that I will die easily?"
<br><br>An ice-cold voice came from Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>But despite those words, when she looked at the corpse next to Night Energy, monstrous anger boiled in her heart.
<br><br>Because the one before her, indeed, died.
<br><br>Only Baiyang True Palace in order to prevent her from accidents, using forbidden techniques, at great cost on her hand to put three seals.
<br><br>With these three marks, she has three more lives, and is her biggest and most rampant capital.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>But here, by a statue hard knocked off a seal.
<br><br>How could she not hate this?
<br><br>"The statue has been destroyed, the next to die is you guys."
<br><br>"After killing you all, I will then take out that gentleman behind you and refine him into a human stick to relieve my hatred."
<br><br>The ice-cold gaze was cast towards the two of Night Energy's father and daughter, and the killing machine appeared.
<br><br>"Run."
<br><br>Night can father and daughter two see the situation, do not dare to have the slightest lingering, the two back to pull the legs to run.
<br><br>Because at this moment without the statue, the two people simply can not be a match for Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>"Humph, two trash, in front of me to run away?"
<br><br>Bai Shallow One raised his palm and slapped out with one hand.
<br><br>A solid palm print whistled out and covered towards the two.
<br><br>Although the two people ran fast, but in the blink of an eye, the palm print caught up.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>The two were struck in the back, spitting blood in unison and smashing to the ground, dragging out two thousand-foot-long gullies on the ground and knocking down countless buildings before they came to a halt.
<br><br>White shallow reached the two in an instant.
<br><br>The towering position.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Her long sword was raised and cut down directly towards the two people.
<br><br>Faced with this sword, the father and daughter revealed a strong look of despair.
<br><br>Could not see any chance of life.
<br><br>"Could it be that sir this time, blundered ......"
<br><br>The two eyes showed a strong reluctance, but not regret, determined to close their eyes, waiting for death to come.
