Shortly after.
<br><br>The shadow of the fist in the sky above the Immortal River Continent slowly dispersed.
<br><br>And many old monsters watching the fun, also ready to disperse.
<br><br>But at that moment, the sky changed.
<br><br>In the place where the fist shadow broke the sky, a mysterious power instantly diffused towards the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>It filled up the entire Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This power could not be felt by ordinary people, but those old monsters of the Immortal River Continent were instantly filled with hot tears.
<br><br>"Irrigation of Immortality!"
<br><br>"This is the Irrigation of Immortality!" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Oh my, it's really the Irrigation of Immortality, the path of Immortality that has been broken for millions of years in my Immortal River Continent has finally been reopened again!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Countless old monsters let out a wild rejoicing.
<br><br>The Irrigation of Immortality.
<br><br>The necessary path to become an immortal.
<br><br>In the past, when the nine lives broke through the ten lives, they were able to receive the Irrigation of Immortality, and after the Irrigation of Immortality, they were also qualified to enter the Immortal Realm, when they were called true Immortals.
<br><br>But since when, a barrier has appeared on the Immortal River Continent, blocking the influx of Immortal Irrigation.
<br><br>Therefore, even if a later person breaks through the Ten Life Martial Emperor, he or she cannot receive the Immortal Irrigation and therefore cannot become an Immortal.
<br><br>Therefore, the Ten Destiny Martial Emperors are also called Pseudo Immortals in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>And between pseudo-immortal and true immortal, although only the difference between the irrigation of immortality, but the power disparity between them is huge.
<br><br>But at this moment.
<br><br>With the power of Immortal Irrigation flooding back into the Immortal River Continent, countless Ten-Life old monsters have received Immortal Irrigation at this moment.
<br><br>Sitting on the ground to become immortal.
<br><br>"I know, perhaps it was that mysterious fist from before that reopened the Immortal River Continent's Immortal Path."
<br><br>"Haha, I broke through first."
<br><br>"Hmph, I'm not much slower than you."
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"So is this the Immortal?"
<br><br>"What a powerful force."
<br><br>"I feel like I can wipe out the entire Immortal River Continent with a wave of my hand."
<br><br>Almost instantly, countless immortals appeared throughout the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>It was a day of revelry for the entire Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>Half a day later.
<br><br>The Immortal River Continent's Middle Continent Region.
<br><br>Dozens of people stood on a high tower, and countless sect disciples gathered under the tower, looking at these people in admiration, filled with fervor.
<br><br>The purpose of this group of people was to directly enter the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>"Old monster, are you leaving in half a day, don't you stay some more days?" A man who had also received the Irrigation of Immortality asked towards an old man.
<br><br>"It's been three thousand years since I broke through the Ten Lives, the Immortal River Continent no longer has a place for me to stay, I can't wait to go to the Immortal Realm." The old man said with an urgent expression.
<br><br>"Well, I really envy you for being a loner who can just say go." The middle-aged man sighed, obviously also eager to follow them over to the Immortal Realm right away.
<br><br>"Older brother, it's no big deal, at most a year, you have to come over too." The old man said with a smile.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The middle-aged man nodded his head.
<br><br>After receiving irrigation, they knew a lot of things that they didn't know before.
<br><br>Because of the difference in the power of the laws, they were not able to stay in the Immortal River Continent for too long.
<br><br>If they did not leave for more than a year, they would be ostracized by the law power of the Immortal River Continent and thus be exterminated by the law.
<br><br>Therefore, whether they want to leave or not, within one year, when they reach this level of cultivation, they must leave this place.
<br><br>"Well, we have sensed the location of the two world barriers, so we will go ahead."
<br><br>After parting.
<br><br>Dozens of newly promoted immortals flew towards the Eastern Victory of the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>With their strength today, it was too easy to run through the Immortal River Continent, and in the blink of an eye, they had already reached the East Victory Nansha Region.
<br><br>And the mountain range below was none other than the Makuhari Mountain Range.
<br><br>"I really didn't expect that the barrier between the two realms would be in such a secluded place." A man said in surprise.
<br><br>"Yes, but without receiving irrigation, it is impossible to touch the two realm barrier, and walking over is just an ordinary mountain range!" Another man said.
<br><br>"Well gentlemen, all this is not important, let's go to the immortal world together." Another old man said: "But everyone said, the immortal world is not like our immortal river continent, no matter how our grudges at home, I hope that when we get to the immortal world we can put aside our grudges and work together, otherwise I'm afraid it will be very difficult to survive ah!"
<br><br>The crowd nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Then crossed the mountain range and passed.
<br><br>After crossing an invisible barrier somewhere, then these people disappeared in the mountain range.
<br><br>And in the following time.
<br><br>Every day, newly promoted immortals came to the Makuhari Mountain Range and crossed the barrier between the two realms to enter the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>And besides the immortals, the demon beasts of the Western Demon Forest were no exception to the rule.
<br><br>The Ten Destiny Demon Emperors likewise received the Irrigation of Immortality and became Demon Immortals.
<br><br>So at this moment, among the Western Demon Forest, ten thousand beasts submitted and sent off for the three great demon immortals who ruled the Western Demon Forest.
<br><br>"Children, after we leave, we must protect my Western Demon Forest from human invasion." A one-horned man at the head, standing high in the void, commanded in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Demon Immortal."
<br><br>The demons answered.
<br><br>"In addition, after we leave, the presidency of the West Demon Forest passes to the Milk Pao Li Demon Emperor, although she is temporarily absent from the West Demon Forest, but when she returns, we must listen to her orders." The one-horned man said again.
<br><br>After explaining everything, the three great demon immortals looked at each other and set off from the West Demon Forest to rush to the place of the two boundary barriers in the East Victory Continent.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>They were interested in the legendary Immortal Realm.
<br><br>They had also longed for it for a long time.
<br><br>"Damn it, how can this be done!"
<br><br>In the Shogun Mountain Range, Yi Feng sat under the tree with a sad face, bow and arrow in hand.
<br><br>I wanted to catch some beasts to go back, so that he can put his clan back mountain to scare people, but so many days into the mountain, wild boars and hares are seen a lot, the food is also improved quite well, but can scare people of the beast, really is not a see.
<br><br>"How can this be good ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed, thinking about whether to call home, what the back of the mountain plan shelved forget.
<br><br>And at this moment, across the continent, the three great western demon forest demon immortal, also finally reached the Shade Mountain Range, not far from the barrier between the two worlds.
<br><br>"On my command, pass carefully and be sure to be alert."
<br><br>The one-horned man in the lead instructed towards the two.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The two men nodded their heads.
<br><br>Then they carefully flew towards the Two Realms Barrier.
<br><br>But at that moment, an invisible force suddenly enveloped the entire space, and even for them with Demon Immortal cultivation, they were instantly suppressed into their origin state.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"Obviously, we haven't passed the barrier yet, we are still in the Immortal River Continent, how could such a thing happen?"
<br><br>The three of them transmitted their voices, full of incomprehension.
<br><br>"Yikes."
<br><br>"What a big three beasts, that's you guys."
<br><br>Just in the midst of the puzzlement, a surprised voice came from not far away.
<br><br>The three beasts inclined their heads to look and found a white-robed figure standing up from under the tree, emitting an excited voice towards them.
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>The three demons instantly saw the bottom of this person.
<br><br>Glancing at each other, they did not give it a second thought at all.
<br><br>But what they didn't expect was that three bows and arrows, sharpened by tree branches, flew crookedly towards them ......
