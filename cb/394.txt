Also at the same time, the dark clouds in the sky swept towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The sky of Pingjiang City was depressing to the extreme, turning into a grayish haze.
<br><br>"That mysterious person, is in this city!"
<br><br>"Not bad, although it's not locked to the exact location, but it's almost there by this extent."
<br><br>"Our arrival, he should also be aware of it, I think he will receive us guests who have come from afar properly!"
<br><br>In the black fog, the voices of the crowd came out.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The black fog condensed out by several giant faces, in conjunction with the use of the art of boundary divination, had already been traced to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>And at this moment re-arrived at the entrance of the martial arts school, Yi Feng, looking at the sky above his head is about to resemble the black night, just a simple glance.
<br><br>This is nothing unusual for him, is not a solar eclipse, the previous life has seen a lot.
<br><br>Stretch a lazy back, go across the beef restaurant to eat noodles. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Huh!"
<br><br>"This person is calm, actually do not come out!"
<br><br>"Hmph, since he won't come out, then we'll have to force you out!"
<br><br>Within the black fog, an icy voice came out.
<br><br>Then the art of boundary divination enveloped Pingjiang City once again.
<br><br>In an instant, a large amount of information from Pingjiang City was inhaled into the black fog.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"This city!"
<br><br>"Looks like we've found that mysterious person's lair all at once, otherwise how could there be so many strong people in this city?"
<br><br>Boundary divination to part of the information of Pingjiang City, spare their state of mind also could not help but draw a breath of cold air backwards, emitting a shocked voice.
<br><br>The depth of this city was just too deep!
<br><br>"Huh, it's not right!"
<br><br>"There are several powerful auras!"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"How can there be several powerful auras?"
<br><br>"Could it be that there are so many high-level powerhouses in this city?"
<br><br>"Impossible, this can't be, this is absolutely impossible!"
<br><br>"Yes, this level of aura is not much different from us, how can a small city gather so many, I think it is more likely that this person put out the mist in order to hide his identity."
<br><br>"Yes, I also think so!"
<br><br>Also at the time when the black fog was shrouded, there were many people in Pingjiang City who also turned their eyes to the sky.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This time, the incident was different from the past, much less a pedestrian fight like the Martial Emperor Human Immortal.
<br><br>Everyone knew by heart that this black fog definitely did not come for no reason.
<br><br>And it was not something unusual either.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>An old lady asked.
<br><br>"Sir are still there leisurely eating noodles, what are you worried about, sell your tofu!" An old man said with no good humor.
<br><br>The old lady looked down the street.
<br><br>Sure enough, Yi Feng was plying his noodles, not even taking a look at the gloomy sky.
<br><br>She put her heart down and continued to sell bean curd.
<br><br>Only, she can feel at ease down to sell tofu, but there are still a lot of people feel uneasy, have come to the beef noodle restaurant, in the name of eating noodles, and Yi Feng to talk.
<br><br>"Sir, this day ......"
<br><br>"Yes sir, how do you half worry, still can eat noodles ah!"
<br><br>"Will this be something big ah!"
<br><br>Someone worried voice came out.
<br><br>"Shiver ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng pouted, while shivered noodles at the same time, while waving his hand towards the side and said: "Don't worry, you may not have encountered, but I've seen a lot of this situation, just a small thing, don't have to put it on your mind, it will soon disappear, rest assured!"
<br><br>"Small things, seen a lot?"
<br><br>The people have looked at each other's eyes, glanced at the bland eating noodles Yi Feng, and then glanced at the dark and cloudy sky, lamented the worthy sir.
<br><br>The terrifying aura of this sky, even the people of Pingjiang City, also feel oppressed, but here in Mr. is also a small thing.
<br><br>With Yi Feng's words, the crowd is considered to eat a pill of certainty.
<br><br>The noodles to eat noodles, the sale of things to sell things, the vision of the sky completely do not care anymore.
