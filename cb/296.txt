Hearing that.
<br><br>Meng Li Xian's face turned white.
<br><br>Fiercely took a step back.
<br><br>Clenching her red lips, her expression was filled with remorse.
<br><br>In her heart, she secretly hated herself for being blind just now, and missed a great opportunity.
<br><br>However, the previous her could not believe the words of Desolate Pathless.
<br><br>Because the immortal path has been broken, the cultivation that Desolation Wuji said is really hard to believe, it is simply the existence of subversive thinking.
<br><br>So if she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, she wouldn't have believed it even if her own father had told her, not to mention Desolate Wuji.
<br><br>But who would have thought that this kind of subversive thinking would happen right in front of her eyes?
<br><br>And Desolate Wuji also looked ugly at the side.
<br><br>He knows that Meng Li Xian uses the zither as her cultivation, so he knows exactly how much the sound of Yi Feng's zither works on Meng Li Xian. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But now what can he say?
<br><br>I can only sigh and say that Meng Lixian is to blame.
<br><br>In place for a long time stagnant, looking downcast Meng Li Xian still hardened his head to walk up to the wine table and poured a glass of wine.
<br><br>"Ex ......"
<br><br>But just as she exited, Desolate Wuji glared at her.
<br><br>She hurriedly reacted and said with a face full of apologies towards Yi Feng: "Yi ...... brother, just now it was me who had eyes without pearls to offend much, this cup of wine I give you to make amends, I hope you do not put me in mind."
<br><br>After saying this, Meng Li Xian drank it all in one go.
<br><br>It must be said that Meng Lixian's action made Yi Feng quite surprised and impressed.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Slightly hesitant, Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Since you a woman can afford to let go and can have such courage, then he a man is even more catty.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, misunderstanding, it's all a misunderstanding."
<br><br>"All sit down."
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolation No Trail breathed a sigh of relief and arranged Meng Li Xian to sit down on the side, obviously also intended to lift this awkward atmosphere.
<br><br>"Come."
<br><br>After sitting down, Yi Feng hesitated for a moment and raised his cup towards Meng Lixian.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Meng Lixian was flattered and hurriedly got up to raise her cup to welcome her.
<br><br>One cup down, she blushed.
<br><br>This serious contact, only to find that Yi Feng carries an attractive aura, especially that gentle look, it is difficult not to let people cause good feelings.
<br><br>What just happened, not only did not count her, but ......
<br><br>This made Meng Li Xian feel even more guilty and was groundless for a while.
<br><br>At this moment, she had to admit that even if Yi Feng did not have that kind of cultivation, she was willing to get along with him.
<br><br>And just when the atmosphere of the three returned to active, Yin Shengfu, who was sitting on the side as if he was not interested in anything, suddenly took out a chessboard and pushed himself.
<br><br>"Ugh."
<br><br>"This old man."
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolate Wujian and Meng Li Xian shook their heads at the same time and explained towards Yi Feng: "This old man, nothing can draw him half an interest, except his chess board."
<br><br>"It's good to play chess!"
<br><br>Seeing the chessboard, Yi Feng instantly became interested.
<br><br>After all, his task of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting, there is only chess left to be completed.
<br><br>"Come old brother, I'll play a hand with you." Yi Feng walked over and smiled.
<br><br>However, Yin Shengfu said expressionlessly, "This chess of mine is not something that anyone can touch, and besides, I won't waste time for no reason."
<br><br>At those words, Yi Feng's face was ugly.
<br><br>Come on.
<br><br>First it was Meng Li Xian, and now this old man.
<br><br>Who the hell are these people?
<br><br>I don't have a problem with you refusing to play chess with me, but can you speak with some basic respect?
<br><br>However, Yin Shengfu was still immersed in his chess board, ignoring Yi Feng completely.
<br><br>Yi Feng was too lazy to make a fool of himself, so he asked Arai Wuji where the toilet was, and hurriedly ran to the toilet to clean the bubble that had been holding the wine.
<br><br>But Yi Feng just left, Desolate Wu Jie and Meng Li Xian are jumping straight.
<br><br>"Old man, what are you doing?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>Yin Shengfu remained lazy, his eyes thoughtfully looking at his chessboard.
<br><br>"I'm talking to you." Desolate Wujing bellowed in exasperation, "Don't you still fail to see what kind of person this brother of mine is?"
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>Yin Shengfu said with an expressionless face.
<br><br>"Then you still say such words?" Meng Li Xian also scolded.
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Yin Shengfu raised his head and responded, "Whether he is an immortal or a god, what does it have to do with me?"
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>Meng Li Xian was furious and said, "People look up to you and want to play chess with you, but what do you mean with that stinky face, just now I have almost offended him, do you want to offend him again?"
<br><br>"There is nothing to offend or not to offend."
<br><br>Yin Shengfu said expressionlessly, "This chess board of mine, indeed, not anyone can touch it, I play chess, but only with chess board experts, so no matter what he is, if he is not good enough, it is also a stain on my chess board."
<br><br>"But how do you know that people are not good enough at chess?" Desolate Wuji asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"One person only fine one, he has already reached the heavenly man with his high zither intent, but there is no way that the second path will be accomplished again, this is the heavenly order cannot be disobeyed!" Yin Shengfu said expressionlessly.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The two of them had ugly faces.
<br><br>This thing, indeed.
<br><br>However, when I think of the old man's refusal to Yi Feng's appearance still felt wrong, thinking of this, Desolate Wujing coldly said: "Old man, I don't care about those rules you have or don't have, when that brother of mine comes back later, you must play a game with him, otherwise don't blame me for turning my face away."
<br><br>"Yes, we must play a game."
<br><br>Meng Li Xian also said with a sullen face, her own disrespect to Yi Feng had already made it hard for her, she did not want someone who was a high ranking person to suffer repeatedly in their small place.
<br><br>Yin Shengfu looked at the two, silent for a long time, and only then reluctantly nodded his head.
<br><br>Not long after, Yi Feng returned from the toilet.
<br><br>The two men greeted up with a smile and laughed, "Brother, that old man is this strange character, don't take it to heart, come come come, play a game with him now, let's open our eyes."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at this zombie old man, to be honest is really do not want to follow the old man under.
<br><br>However, looking at the enthusiastic appearance of the two people of Desolation No Path, and remembering that his chess skills are not yet comparable to God's, after a slight hesitation, Yi Feng reluctantly agreed.
<br><br>Yin Shengfu set up the chess board, looked at Yi Feng, said expressionlessly, "Ugly words in the front, I am not going to give you face because of your identity, while this game, the next one will not be an example."
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>At once, Yi Feng was furious.
<br><br>This old man look down on people, really fucking flat.
<br><br>I'll see.
<br><br>Then I will take a good look, you old man chess skills in the end how cow.
