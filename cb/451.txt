"What a powerful power!"
<br><br>Although Night Energy and the others didn't know why Bai Shanyi had been resurrected again and again, when they saw such an expert as Bai Shanyi fleeing so wretchedly under the attack of the painting scroll, their hearts couldn't help but be shocked to the extreme.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"We really missed so many opportunities!"
<br><br>On the other side, Liu Gu Yi and the others who were watching the battle had bitter faces and could not help but shake their heads with regret.
<br><br>"Yes, this father and daughter now not only have the cultivation of an Earth Immortal, and such a painting, even Bai Shanyi was beaten and scampered, the whole North Sea is invincible ah!"
<br><br>"Who says it is not."
<br><br>"Now in this situation, our so-called four sects, but only a name remains."
<br><br>"Alas, the future North Sea, I'm afraid that there is no place for our four sects!"
<br><br>But for this situation, they can only nod helplessly.
<br><br>The sea has changed, the times have changed. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At the turning point if you choose the right path, pigs can also be blown up on the wind.
<br><br>On the contrary, if they do not choose the right road, then they will only gradually in the annihilation of the history of the long river.
<br><br>And they, belong to the latter.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>Just at this moment, a pleasant whistling sound came from the north.
<br><br>The crowd was busy looking at it, and to their surprise, they found a flying boat speeding towards this side with the speed of a stream of light.
<br><br>There was still a long distance to go, and it gave them great pressure.
<br><br>Such a big commotion naturally attracted the attention of some people in the shadows.
<br><br>For example, there were other forces in the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>"My lord, this person might be able to be of use to you!"
<br><br>In the void, an old man stood respectfully in front of a middle-aged man and said softly.
<br><br>"That depends on whether he has the ability to do so." The middle-aged man laughed: "Although the strength shown by his wooden sculpture and painting scroll is quite good, it is not enough for me."
<br><br>"Then how is it enough?"
<br><br>The old man couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"At least a slight resistance in front of Bai Yang True Palace." The middle-aged man said leisurely.
<br><br>"I think it's difficult."
<br><br>The old man laughed bitterly: "Baiyang True Palace is not a weak power in the Lingxu Realm, that Lu Zhengyi is even to the Golden Immortal cultivation above the Heavenly Immortals, in addition to so many Heavenly Immortals, ordinary people can not resist ah!"
<br><br>"Indeed difficult."
<br><br>The middle-aged man laughed: "But I also do not require him to be able to defeat Bai Yang True Palace, but his next performance, at least must also make me satisfied."
<br><br>"If it satisfies me, I can step in to save him once."
<br><br>"Of course, if it's just a waste, it's just as well to die, it's not worth my hand."
<br><br>"Your Excellency is right."
<br><br>The old man nodded approvingly.
<br><br>"Let's just see what happens next."
<br><br>The man smiled and stood with his hands in the void, watching the show.
<br><br>The speed of the flying boat was extremely fast.
<br><br>But in half a moment it flew over half of the North Sea land and came to the sky above Baier City.
<br><br>The huge flying boat cast a large shadow over Baier City.
<br><br>With Lu Zhengyi as the leader, dozens of experts with profound aura looked down at Baier City and others.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Night can father and daughter two big shocked color.
<br><br>Both from the battle and from the flying boat on the breath of the crowd can be distinguished, this should be the White Sun True Palace behind the white shallow one to move out.
<br><br>What scares them more is that the experts on the flying boat, none of the breath is weaker than the white shallow one.
<br><br>That is to say.
<br><br>These are all Heavenly Immortal cultivation.
<br><br>This made the night can father and daughter both draw a breath of cold air backwards, the heart straight hair.
<br><br>A single Bai Shallow One had turned the entire North Sea upside down, let alone dozens of such experts.
<br><br>"Father, what should we do?"
<br><br>Night Yi is always inexperienced, see this scene heart and soul some panic, towards the night can transmit a panicked voice of inquiry.
<br><br>"Don't panic, we have sir behind us." Night can hasten to comfort: "And the big deal is just a death."
<br><br>"Yes, we have sir behind us."
<br><br>Thinking of that white-robed figure, Night Yi took a deep breath and also calmed down at once.
<br><br>"This thing, it's really getting bigger and bigger, I didn't expect the experts from the White Sun True Palace to come out so quickly."
<br><br>The Liu Gu Yi and the others on the side, seeing Lu Zheng Yi and the others, also suddenly discussed a lot.
<br><br>"What do we do?"
<br><br>Yun Tianlong couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Go, this is not something we can get involved in." Liu Gu Yi said solemnly.
<br><br>"But, this is an opportunity for us, isn't it?"
<br><br>Yun Tianlong flickered his gaze and looked at the three of them and said, "For us, it is now an opportunity to re-side, either we side with Bai Yang True Palace, who won, and we will be able to feel better in the future when we are under their control."
<br><br>"Either ......"
<br><br>"Is to stand in line with the one of the Green Bull Sect, then, we may also have a chance to be like the two of the Night Energy father and daughter!"
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi three people were silent.
<br><br>Yun Tianlong was right.
<br><br>Now was indeed a good opportunity to stand in line.
<br><br>Perhaps their dabbling can't affect anything, but for some big shots, what is wanted is simply an attitude.
<br><br>But this team.
<br><br>Is it really that easy to stand?
<br><br>Stand well is good, but if not stand well, to meet them will be a devastating blow.
<br><br>"Do you think the chances of winning?"
<br><br>Li Canghai asked.
<br><br>"At the moment, although that painting scroll is powerful, but if the one from the Green Ox Sect doesn't have a backhand, it's hard to face such a lineup of Baiyang True Palace!" Yun Tianlong said.
<br><br>"Indeed." Liu Gu Yi said: "But no one can guarantee that that one does not have a backhand!"
<br><br>Several people nodded to each other, Liu Gu Yi said also has a point.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The four people are in a difficult position, do not know how to choose.
<br><br>"Forget it, let's protect ourselves!" After the silence, Liu Gu Yi said.
<br><br>Li Canghai and Yun Tianlong also nodded bitterly.
<br><br>This decision was indeed too difficult to make, perhaps it was the wisest decision to be wise and leave the place.
<br><br>The three of them were just about to leave when they noticed Jian Hengtian walking towards the two of them at Night Energy.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian what are you doing?" Liu Gu Yi shouted with a sullen face.
<br><br>"I'm standing in line for the one from the Green Ox Sect." Jian Hengtian said with a sullen face.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>At Jian Hengtian's decision, Liu Gu Yi revealed an unbelievable look.
<br><br>"Aren't you afraid that the one from the Green Ox Sect will not be defeated, knowing that now he is facing the entire Baiyang True Palace!" Liu Gu Yi shouted.
<br><br>"To die eggs towards the sky, have missed so many times, I do not want to miss in!"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian resolutely walked towards the night can two people, back to Liu Gu Yi waved his hand, shouted: "To go, you guys go!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Liu Gu Yi three people can only helplessly sigh a sigh.
<br><br>But it also had to be said that they somewhat admired Jian Hengtian, admired him for having such vigor at this time and being able to stand so firmly in line.
<br><br>The three Liu Gu Yi swept up into the air and retreated to a faraway place to watch the battle.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian you?"
<br><br>Night Energy looked at Jian Hengtian who was walking, and a surprised voice came out.
<br><br>"I was fortunate enough to have received a chance from Mr., and I am considered half of Mr., so I will face it with you." Jian Hengtian and Night Energy stood side by side and said decisively.
<br><br>The two of them opened their mouths and looked at Jian Hengtian with some admiration.
<br><br>Perhaps Jian Hengtian could not play any role at all, but to be able to stand by their side at this time, still made them moved.
<br><br>Bai Shangyi indifferently glanced at the night can a few people, then directly ignored.
<br><br>After all, her eyes are only the painting, and the person behind the scroll. The night can stream, simply not worthy to let her put in the eyes.
<br><br>"Master, it was the mighty energy released from that painting that knocked out three of my seals."
<br><br>Staring at the scroll, Bai Shanyi said with a face full of hatred, "This scroll and the statue I mentioned to you on the way are both from that person's hand."
<br><br>"But the statue I have destroyed, only this painting remains, as long as this painting is suppressed, we will be able to uncover the person behind it."
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's pupils tightened, staring at the painting scroll with a deadly gaze, and he had to say that this painting scroll brought him a very strong sense of crisis.
<br><br>But he didn't panic.
<br><br>After all, this time, he had brought the battle power of the entire Bai Yang True Palace.
<br><br>Still couldn't deal with a painting?
<br><br>"All of you, listen to my orders, join hands to set up a formation and destroy this painting scroll!"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi shouted in a cold voice.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, dozens of Heavenly Immortals swept down from their flying boats and surrounded the painting scroll from all sides.
<br><br>"Formation start!"
<br><br>The leader, Lu Zhengyi, made a hand seal, and a powerful force spread towards the scroll.
<br><br>The others also made their moves at the same time, and sacrificed their power.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>The power of dozens of Heavenly Immortals gathered together, and with the support of the formation, the scroll was immediately trapped in an energy cage.
<br><br>The scroll golden light up in all directions, the woman's eyes light pillar constantly shot out.
<br><br>But although the pillar of light is strong, but because dozens of people evenly bear the pillar of light attack, resulting in difficult to cause the actual effect.
<br><br>And with the gradual passage of time, the painting scroll light full began to slowly dull, issued by the attack is also getting weaker and weaker.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The power of the painting scroll was sapped to the extreme.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi directly withdrew the formation, and with a flip of his palm, a sharp claw mark was forced straight into the painting scroll.
<br><br>"Tear!"
<br><br>The painting scroll instantly turned into confetti and lost all its power.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, the one standing on the flying boat full of hatred laughed coldly.
<br><br>Think at first, the power of this painting scroll chased her wretchedly, now under her Baiyang true palace power, still not become a scrap of paper?
