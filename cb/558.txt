Soon, the district Pingjiang City is no longer enough for Yi Feng to show his greatness.
<br><br>It is just as well that there are not a hundred disciples, let them pass on the scriptures to themselves.
<br><br>One hundred people will go to one hundred places, and the people in one hundred places will then tell the people in other places.
<br><br>Then will not his name resound throughout the Immortal River Continent is just around the corner?
<br><br>Yi Feng smile hard to hide.
<br><br>No way, he is such a superficial person.
<br><br>The most important thing right now is to give himself a nickname for them to spread?
<br><br>Wind and cloud warrior, the palm of heaven? Too vulgar not.
<br><br>The first in the world, the only one to seek defeat? Too earthy and not good.
<br><br>Until people have arrived at the Heaven and Earth Gate, Yi Feng has not yet come up with a name that is worthy of himself.
<br><br>Just in time to see Wu Yonghong and others out of the Heaven and Earth Gate. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Wu Yonghong and others, since he took in the three, the three dried up old men were not worried about food and clothing, all mellowed a lot and looked better.
<br><br>"Old Wu!" He called out, "Where is this going?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong also followed behind Sun Zhuge Chu Mad Lion saw Yi Feng and hurriedly bowed low, "Good day, sir. We are going to pick up some things needed by the sect."
<br><br>"Well, it looks like you guys have been doing well lately." Yi Feng said and sighed, "Unlike me, it's hard to avoid day and night lately, it's very troublesome."
<br><br>"We admire you for your exhaustive efforts, sir." Wu Yonghong three people said.
<br><br>"Hey, my troubles, you mortals, forget it, do not understand." Said, Yi Feng back up his hands, chin up, looking at the sky and shaking his head.
<br><br>"Yes." Wu Yonghong answered.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, "You ask ah, what troubles."
<br><br>"Uh ......" Wu Yonghong stuck, "What troubles?"
<br><br>The breeze on the mountain blew, blowing the broken hair in front of Yi Feng's forehead, he tossed his hair, despondent and helpless, "The world's invincible troubles."
<br><br>"Yes." Wu Yonghong replied in response.
<br><br>Behind him, Chu Mad Lion gave Wu Yonghong's coat a tug.
<br><br>He suddenly remembered something and jerked his head up, backing up repeatedly, bumping into Chu Mad Lion and Sun Zhuge behind him, who also backed up repeatedly.
<br><br>The three stared at Yi Feng with wide eyes incredulously!
<br><br>"Mr. first first first, practice the world invincible?!" He almost forgot what Pork Rong had come to remind before!
<br><br>"When did mister practiced the world invincible?!"
<br><br>"Ah! Invincible under the sky! I've never seen it before!" Chu Wild Lion even backed up one after another, his legs went weak and he knelt down, "Mister great talent!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was satisfied with the crowd's reaction.
<br><br>"Count yourselves insightful." Yi Feng nodded, "And no need to be shocked, it's normal."
<br><br>"By the way, you guys recall all my disciples. I want to have a clan assembly."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong answered, and Yi Feng took off into the air.
<br><br>This time flying every day, he has long harnessed the power of flight. Lightly and smoothly.
<br><br>Left Wu Yonghong three people in the same place to watch him disappear instantly.
<br><br>Breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Fortunately, pork rong came to remind us. Otherwise we would have to upset Mr.." Wu Yonghong wiped the sweat from his head fearfully.
<br><br>"Yes, it looks like sir was satisfied with our reaction just now." Chu Mad Lion returned.
<br><br>"Let's hurry and use the jade slip to recall sir's disciples first."
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had returned to the main hall, hurriedly pulled out his copy of the Immortal River Continent Cultivation Grade.
<br><br>When the disciples came back there was going to be a clan meeting.
<br><br>He wants to see if the martial emperor has other skills have been ordered full.
<br><br>Light a vacant flight forced style has not been able to keep up.
<br><br>Before obtaining the cultivation level of the martial emperor in a hurry, only roughly saw the highest level of the immortal river continent is the martial emperor.
<br><br>Now a closer look, only to find that this martial emperor also divided into levels.
<br><br>One life -
<br><br>Second life--
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the corners of his mouth hooked up.
<br><br>The further down, the higher the corners of the mouth hooked.
<br><br>Ten lives--
<br><br>After the Ten Lives Martial Emperor suffered the heavenly tribulation, he was equal to a human immortal.
<br><br>Seeing this, the corners of Yi Feng's mouth were splitting to the back of his neck.
<br><br>The system said the highest, then he must be the highest ten lives.
<br><br>Maybe the heavenly tribulation has not even need to cross.
<br><br>Good guy, he is already equivalent to a human immortal.
<br><br>Yi Feng can no longer hold back, "ah ha ha ha ha, gods and immortals ah ha ha ha ha! I am now equivalent to a god immortal!!!"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed wildly and hugged the "Immortal River Continent Cultivation Level" and kissed it wildly, "Good system, you are really my own father!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked up to the sky and laughed long and hard, and turned the Immortal River Continent over in excitement, "Good man, I don't even have to suffer the heavenly calamity!"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha let me see what other benefits!"
<br><br>"Immortal world summoning hahaha, ha ......" gaze swept over, the last line, Yi Feng's laughter abruptly stopped, "Ha?"
<br><br>"Immortal world summoning?"
<br><br>What the hell?
<br><br>Yi Feng came up to the front, even close to the pages of the book.
<br><br>He read word by word, "Ten Life Martial Emperor is the highest rank in the Immortal River Continent, rising to this rank will be summoned by the Immortal Realm."
<br><br>Word by word, he was long and serious.
<br><br>"One ...... year ...... of ...... within ...... must ...... must ...... enter ...... into the ...... immortal... ...realm."
<br><br>"Otherwise, being ...... heavenly ...... dao ...... by ...... not ...... tolerated, the soul - flying - soul - scattered."
<br><br>"Later note: human ...... immortal ...... for ...... immortal ...... realm ...... the ...... lowest ...... level ...... level ......"
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>Yi Feng fiercely closed the book, then tightly closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
<br><br>Read wrong read wrong, must have read wrong.
