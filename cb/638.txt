The subordinates were stunned.
<br><br>If it wasn't for the fear of subordination, I really wanted to feel Jiang Zhi's forehead, if he had a fever.
<br><br>That is a mid-level immortal weapon ah.
<br><br>However, after following Jiang Zhi for so long, they still had some trust in Jiang Zhi, probably because Jiang Zhi had other arrangements.
<br><br>So they could only give up for now and carry out Jiang Zhi's orders.
<br><br>"By the way."
<br><br>"This is Senior Lu and Senior Wu, you guys come over and pay your respects to them." Remembering something, Jiang Zhi hurriedly introduced, "In the future, you will see them as you see me, and for their words, you will carry them out unconditionally."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd of subordinates turned their eyes toward Wu Yonghong and Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>Frowns were instantly raised.
<br><br>Two human immortals? Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Your Holiness, you are?"
<br><br>Jiang Shang couldn't help but ask, "And these two are?"
<br><br>"It doesn't matter what they are, and you are not qualified to know yet, what matters is what I just said, didn't you hear?" Jiang Zhi aggravated his tone.
<br><br>"Your Holiness, this ......"
<br><br>The faces of the people were a little ugly.
<br><br>In terms of the immortal cultivation world, the strongest is the most important, and whoever has the biggest fist will listen to him.
<br><br>Each of them cultivated to senior Xuan Xian or even Reincarnation Immortal realm, they all walked out as good characters, who still didn't have some arrogance?
<br><br>There is no problem to make them work hard for Jiang Zhi, but if you ask them to be respectful to two human immortals, they really can't lower their heads a bit.
<br><br>"What, don't you listen to my orders?"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi's face chilled with anger.
<br><br>These two were mister's people.
<br><br>When did this group of her unenlightened subordinates become so eyeless.
<br><br>"Perhaps they are relatives or other elders in His Eminence's family." Seeing that Jiang Zhi was already on the verge of fury, Jiang Shang hurriedly whispered a voice transmission towards the others, "Since they are His Eminence's family elders, even if they are only Human Immortals, we should be respectful to them, hurry up and pay our respects!"
<br><br>Hearing Jiang Shang transmitting his voice in this way, the crowd reluctantly nodded their heads.
<br><br>"We, the two seniors, pay our respects!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Jiang Zhi's face only looked quite good, and then rigorously and methodically ordered the task down, and only when she saw that the people were strictly carrying out, she nodded her head in satisfaction.
<br><br>Sir explained the matter, she will not allow any mistakes.
<br><br>Turning back to the two of them, Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong, Jiang Zhi said with a face full of embarrassment, "Please don't be ordinary with them, two seniors."
<br><br>"Haha, trivial matter, we are just two human immortals, no need to be too polite to us." Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong laughed indifferently.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>But remembering Soga Rentu, her heart was also still heavy with worry.
<br><br>Even though she was now at the True Element Immortal Realm, her eyesight was raised not generally high, and the intermediate level immortal weapons were indeed not in her eyes.
<br><br>But to return to reality, she had to admit that she followed Yi Feng eyesight is high, but she does not have intermediate level immortal weapons ah!
<br><br>Maybe asking these two to help her find Soga Rentu to take revenge without much effort.
<br><br>But these two, no matter what, are also the people around the seniors.
<br><br>She was really embarrassed to bother them both unless it was a necessary moment.
<br><br>So she thought, should she borrow one or two intermediate level immortal weapons from them, and then return them after she had finished seeking revenge from Soga Rentu?
<br><br>After being torn, she finally spoke to the two with a stiff upper lip.
<br><br>"Two seniors, the young woman has a request, and I hope that the two seniors can grant it." Jiang Zhi bowed her head respectfully.
<br><br>"We're all family, there's no need to be so polite." Lu Qingshan laughed.
<br><br>"Thank you, seniors."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi said gratefully, "I think the two seniors must have heard what we said just now, my enemy, at all times, is afraid that they have intermediate level immortal weapons to defend themselves, so I would like to implore the two seniors to also lend me one or two intermediate level immortal weapons, and then return them to the two seniors after I have taken care of this matter myself."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong looked at each other.
<br><br>Their expressions were rather difficult.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>A bitter smile appeared on Jiang Zhi's face.
<br><br>It is also.
<br><br>After all, it is an intermediate level immortal weapon, how can it be lent to others for no reason, but she is a bit whimsical.
<br><br>So hurriedly explained again: "The junior also just say, two seniors if it is not good to borrow, no matter, do not take it to heart."
<br><br>"Aiya, little girl, we don't mean that." Lu Qingshan explained, "It's not that we don't want to lend you intermediate level immortal weapons, it's just that we really can't take this kind of trash stuff."
<br><br>"Yes little girl."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong also explained, "Intermediate level immortal artifacts are really something that are not even used by dogs in our Heaven and Earth Sect, so we really can't take them out!"
<br><br>Dogs?
<br><br>Not even used by dogs?
<br><br>Jiang Zhi stood in place, staring at the beautiful eyes, the corners of her mouth twitched.
<br><br>Look also in a dumbfounded state.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>This is human words?
<br><br>For a while, it is difficult to describe the shock inside her heart with words.
<br><br>"So intermediate level immortal weapons we really can not take out, if you are willing, top level immortal weapons you take a few things!" Lu Qingshan said.
<br><br>At these words, Jiang to was speechless with excitement for a while.
<br><br>So where would she be unwilling?
<br><br>With tears of joy, she said, "Many thanks to the two seniors, I will definitely return it to the two seniors after I have taken my revenge."
<br><br>"You're welcome, you're welcome."
<br><br>"It's all a family that serves you sir."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan smiled faintly and opened his storage ring with a
<br><br>There was a clatter.
<br><br>More than three hundred pieces of different top-grade immortal weapons were taken out by him, swords and spears, pots and pans and all kinds of things.
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Jiang to stunned, directly petrified in place.
<br><br>Three ......
<br><br>More than three hundred pieces?
<br><br>"What's the matter girl child, no satisfaction?" Lu Qingshan asked, so he hurriedly made a wink towards Wu Yonghong.
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Yonghong hurriedly said, "No need to rush if you are not satisfied, I still have more than four hundred pieces here, feel free to pick."
<br><br>Saying that, Wu Yonghong storage ring also a open, really really four hundred kinds of top immortal weapons appeared in front of the eyes.
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Jiang to once again dumbfounded, straight feel breathless.
<br><br>"These are the formed ones."
<br><br>"There are also these unformed ones don't underestimate, the same top-notch ones, all are leftover edges when sir is fine!" Wu Yonghong patiently explained.
<br><br>Jiang to already shocked do not know what to say is good.
<br><br>After a long, long time, she patted her head to clear her head a bit, and only then said with gratitude, "The two seniors are really too polite, I just need to pick one piece."
<br><br>"Eh."
<br><br>"How can one piece work?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan said with a stern face.
<br><br>"That's right, how can one piece, it's not enough to live on." Wu Yonghong also picked up the accent, "In our Heaven and Earth Gate, from the bowl for eating to the towel for wiping face, all are of this level, since they are all Mr.'s people, the quality of life has to be raised, otherwise it is a disgrace to Mr.."
<br><br>"So take some more!"
<br><br>Said, two people one stuffed more than ten pieces of top-grade immortal weapons in Jiang to the hands, cheerful laugh: "are a family, also do not say what to borrow or not, these things later you feel free to take use is."
<br><br>"Yes, there is not enough!
