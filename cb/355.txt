And the black feather sitting in the formation, the corners of his mouth also spread a cold smile.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The thunder pillar had reached the top of the head.
<br><br>And the three demons' attack was also close at hand.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What the three demons did not expect was that at such a time, the dog and the centipede were actually chatting to themselves.
<br><br>"Brother Qing, take a look at this shell of mine, is it pretty?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede asked.
<br><br>"It's not bad, but I feel like the hair on my body looks better."
<br><br>The dog said.
<br><br>"That's right, Brother Qing's hair is definitely better looking than mine, but when it comes to face value, it's still our big brother Jagged Man." Night Wind Centipede said. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"That's right, the strongest and most handsome in the world is the master and big brother." The dog also said.
<br><br>Listening to the conversation of this dog and a centipede, the coldness in the hearts of the three demons intensified.
<br><br>Not only are they mole crickets, but they are also a bunch of fucking idiots.
<br><br>How dare they have the leisure to chat, until now they can't figure out their situation, do they not know what they will face next?
<br><br>Just at this moment.
<br><br>Let them shocked scene suddenly happened.
<br><br>The dull skeleton Ben Wei, suddenly from the black robe extended a white finger.
<br><br>Then it touched with the lightning pillar that followed through.
<br><br>Finger.
<br><br>The water tank-like thunder pillar.
<br><br>This large and small, forming a stark contrast.
<br><br>From the visual point of view, it is undoubtedly an egg touching a stone.
<br><br>But what people did not expect was that when the thunder pillar touched the finger, it suddenly dissipated into thin air.
<br><br>The sky at this moment, also fiercely restore clear.
<br><br>It was as if that thunder and lightning, had never appeared.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>When the three demons saw this scene, their faces were shocked.
<br><br>"It seems that this skeleton is not as weak as we said, so be careful."
<br><br>Then, Rhinoceros Lin reminded towards the two demons and continued to attack out.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>They didn't realize what this meant.
<br><br>But in the face of their attacks, Skeleton Ben Wei didn't even look at them, and after disposing of the thunderbolt, he just lightly waved his hand.
<br><br>In a flash, a vast wave spread out towards the three demons.
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>The three demons' faces changed greatly, and this skeleton's attack was like an appalling wave crashing in.
<br><br>In a moment.
<br><br>It caused them to suffer a wound in their chests, spitting out blood in unison, flying backwards, and then fell heavily to the ground.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"This broken skeleton is actually so strong?"
<br><br>The three demons smashed to the ground, their faces greatly shocked.
<br><br>Apparently Skeleton Ben Wei's strength was beyond their expectations, it was actually strong to the point of defeating the three of them with a wave of his hand.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They still did not panic.
<br><br>Because the strongest fighting force present was not them, but Lord Black Feather from the Immortal World.
<br><br>As long as he was sitting behind the formation, even if such a change occurred, it was still under control.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This skeleton is strong, can also be stronger than the immortal world of Lord Black Feather?
<br><br>So, the three demons turned back in unison and turned their respectful gaze toward Black Feather.
<br><br>"Lord Blackfeather, something has changed, this skeleton is very strong, please also ask Lord Blackfeather personally."
<br><br>The three demons shouted.
<br><br>The next moment their voices fell, Black Feather really moved.
<br><br>Both wings opened fiercely, causing the ground to fill with a large shadow, mighty!
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the three injured demons immediately breathed a huge sigh of relief and turned their frenzied gazes towards Black Feather.
<br><br>This strong aura, this majestic posture, this strong compulsion, all of them were shocked to the extreme.
<br><br>"Lord Black Feather is worthy of being Lord Black Feather!"
<br><br>"Worthy of being an emissary from the Immortal Realm!"
<br><br>"Yes, this is as terrifying as this, it really makes people worship to the utmost!"
<br><br>"Under Lord Blackfeather's might, I'm afraid this broken skeleton will have to kneel down in fear and beg for mercy!"
<br><br>The three demons sighed in admiration.
<br><br>They were full of worship for the Lord Blackfeather they spoke of.
<br><br>Eh?
<br><br>Wait ......
<br><br>Suddenly, the three demons noticed that something was wrong.
<br><br>The target of Lord Blackfeather's attack didn't seem to be that skeleton, but ......
<br><br>them?
<br><br>Under the envelope of Black Feather's aura, the three demons trembled and couldn't help but shout in shock, "Lord Black Feather, you attacked the wrong one, that skeleton is over there."
<br><br>"Tally, the three demons still don't give a quick stop."
<br><br>However, the black feather in mid-air opened its big mouth and majestically sent out a drink towards them.
<br><br>Then a sharp claw mark attacked, hard on their three brothers on the ground.
<br><br>Looking at this powerful claw on the chest, the three demons of the rhinoceros forest stared at their eyes with a face of disbelief.
<br><br>"Lord Black Feather, why are you doing this, did not we agree to work together to kill the skeletons these few?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, it was agreed that you would sit for us, why did you suddenly turn against us in the face of the battle?"
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest could not help but inquire out loud.
<br><br>Facing the three demons' inquiry, Black Feather glared at the bird's eyes and drank righteously: "You three demons, don't spout birds in blood."
<br><br>"How bright and open-minded a bird I am, how could I be in the same boat with demons like you?"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Hearing Black Feather's words, the three demons of Rhino Forest were dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Alas, you guys really let me down, thanks to I still consider you guys as friends, when we agreed that the four of us together, obedient as the pets of Lord Skeleton and that human lord, you guys are conspiring behind the scenes to rebel, really ...... alas ......"
<br><br>Black feather painfully tossed his head and heaved a sigh, then turned back to look at Skeleton Benevolent and the others.
<br><br>"Dear Lord Skeleton, Lord Dog, Lord Centipede, Lord Black Bear, I, Black Feather, have helped several lords to catch these few rebels, and I hope the lords will send them to justice."
<br><br>After saying that, Black Feather respectfully lowered his head.
