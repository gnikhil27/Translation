"Ouch."
<br><br>"This waste kid actually really dare to come yet."
<br><br>"Yes, a cultivation waste, I had thought he would not appear at all, did not expect quite hard."
<br><br>"Hard-hearted what hard-hearted, is simply no self-awareness, from the shame."
<br><br>Seeing Xiao Zhan on the stage, the crowd watching the battle immediately emitted chattering voices.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the face of these voices, Xiao Zhan turned a deaf ear, completely unable to create a half impact on him, and walked towards the ring without being condescending.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan looked at the approaching Xiao Zhan, her eyebrows slightly wrinkled.
<br><br>For some reason, today's Xiao Zhan and the Xiao Zhan seen three days ago, seems a little different.
<br><br>But it was impossible to say exactly what was different.
<br><br>What she didn't expect was that under this kind of occasion and the many mocking voices, Xiao Zhan actually managed to be so calm and natural. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>She suddenly realized that she seemed to have underestimated Xiao Zhaoge before.
<br><br>But this thought was only fleeting.
<br><br>Because.
<br><br>This is not much.
<br><br>At most, it's just that Xiao Zhan has a few pluck.
<br><br>It still wouldn't change the fact that he was a waste, nor would it change the gap between them.
<br><br>"No matter how strong you are, due to the past love between the Xiao and Liu families, I will take this battle seriously and exhibit my strength without reservation, which is considered giving you enough respect." Looked at Xiao Zhan indifferently, said expressionlessly.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan's words caused the scene to boil once again.
<br><br>"Wow, Miss Ruyan Liu is really a saint!"
<br><br>"No, clearly able to slap this punk to death, yet she has to make an extra effort."
<br><br>"I heard that the Xiao family was kind to the Liu family in the past, it seems that Miss Liu is also someone who knows how to repay the kindness, this is considered to have given this brat enough face!"
<br><br>"Yes, to die under Miss Liu Ruyan's full power, this brat is considered to have a shiny face."
<br><br>For a while, various sounds came from the audience.
<br><br>"Bah, set up a pagoda."
<br><br>Li Jin buckled his boogers and spat disdainfully.
<br><br>"That's it, a fight, so much nonsense."
<br><br>Hong Crazy was also full of impatience.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the face of Liu Ruyan's words, Xiao Zhan on the stage remained expressionless.
<br><br>"Is this scaring you silly?"
<br><br>"Then how should one withstand the next shock?"
<br><br>Liu Ruyan laughed coldly in her heart.
<br><br>With that, the dazzling light around her body spread out in all directions, and the cultivation of her body exploded at the same time.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A powerful force spread across the entire field.
<br><br>The moment her cultivation was revealed, various unbelievable voices shouted out in the field.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Earth Immortal?"
<br><br>"It's actually an Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"It's so incredible."
<br><br>"I thought Miss Ruyan Liu was a Human Immortal, but I didn't expect it to be an Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"Such cultivation talent, tsk, worthy of being the number one person in the Southern Region."
<br><br>"No, she's only twenty years old, twenty years old Earth Immortal, I'm afraid it's not as simple as the number one person in the Southern Region, I'm afraid it's ranked number one in the entire empire!"
<br><br>The shocked voices were incessant, and the gazes towards Liu Ruyan were all filled with frenzy.
<br><br>The moment Liu Ruyan revealed her Earth Immortal cultivation, countless news spread out from here.
<br><br>After the ring.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>The reason for setting up such a big stage today was not just because of this punk Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>Because just one Xiao Zhan was not worthy of them.
<br><br>What was really important was to use this opportunity to build up Liu Ruyan's momentum and make a name for herself.
<br><br>With the existence of such a twenty-year-old Earth Immortal, the future of his Heavenly Spirit Sect in the entire empire's discourse will be much higher, and will also make the Imperial Empire's people look more highly.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Anyone has to weigh in, a twenty-year-old Earth Immortal, in a hundred years, will grow to what level of existence.
<br><br>In a thousand years, what kind of situation will it be?
<br><br>So, from the beginning to everything is in their planning.
<br><br>The so-called give Xiao Zhan some dignity is just empty words, but only to let Liu Ruyan brightly and at the same time high-profile exposure of the real strength, so as to cause great repercussions.
<br><br>The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to its customers.
<br><br>With her talent.
<br><br>This is how it should be.
<br><br>She has a bigger stage in the future, and it's not just this group of people who are cheering.
<br><br>The purpose was accomplished.
<br><br>By the way, it was time to settle another matter.
<br><br>She turned her indifferent gaze towards Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>To her dismay, Xiao Zhan stood there with a calm face, regardless of the surrounding voices, or her revealing her great strength, he was unmoved.
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>"Shouldn't he feel desperate?"
<br><br>"Or has he already resigned himself to his fate and given up?"
<br><br>Liu Ruyan frowned at Xiao Zhan, and thought in her heart.
<br><br>Then she shook her head.
<br><br>Just!
<br><br>What he thinks is not important to me.
<br><br>"You do it first, I'll give you a chance to do it." Liu Ruyan said indifferently, "Or you won't have a chance to make a move."
<br><br>"It's better for you to make the first move!" Xiao Zhan said faintly.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The moment his words fell.
<br><br>It instantly caused laughter.
<br><br>"Haha, this kid, laughing to death, right?"
<br><br>"That's it, what's the point of pretending at this time, making a move first at least he can still swing a move, if he lets Miss Liu Ruyan make a move, he doesn't even have the qualifications to make a move."
<br><br>"Alas, it is estimated that he gave up long ago!"
<br><br>"Poor man!"
<br><br>Piercing voices came from all directions, and Xiao Zhan remained unmoved.
<br><br>"Senior brother, seems to be very good at pretending." Li Jin continued to be picking at the pile of boogers that hadn't been picked out and couldn't help but say.
<br><br>He received a blank stare from Su Yun Yun and others.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan's eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>She felt a little amused at Xiao Zhan's attitude.
<br><br>But it doesn't matter.
<br><br>Today's duel with Xiao Zhan, also originally was just going through the motions.
<br><br>Jade hand raised.
<br><br>The long sword in the sleeve strikes harshly, directly forcing Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>This sword.
<br><br>The cold air is compelling, the sword intent is monstrous.
<br><br>In anyone's opinion, Xiao Zhan is already a certain death.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The real result was a big shock.
<br><br>The crowd was unbelievable to see that Xiao Zhan waved his palm, raised his two fingers and directly caught the sword blade.
<br><br>"Buzz!"
<br><br>Due to the powerful force in the sword, it was stopped alive, causing the sword to shake violently, emitting a burst of sword sound.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan, on the other hand, did not move a muscle.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Two fingers on ......"
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Let hundreds of thousands of pairs of eyes in the field, almost directly burst out.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan, whose face was originally as frosty as ice, her pretty face also suddenly changed.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong, who was sitting at the back of the ring waiting to see a good show, also jumped up violently from the stool.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The whole room was silent.
<br><br>The breeze blew by, and the slight sound of the leaves rubbing on the ground became pleasant to the ear.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>What the hell is going on?
<br><br>Xiao Zhan is not a waste without cultivation, how can so easily catch the strength of the Earth Immortal, Liu Ruyan a sword?
<br><br>The crowd's minds were dumbfounded, unable to react for a while.
<br><br>In the field.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan's voice came out.
<br><br>"It's my turn, to strike ......"
<br><br>He fiercely raised those sharp eyes and his two fingers were stiffly snapped off the tip of the sword.
<br><br>Subsequently without the slightest delay, the palm of his hand raised.
<br><br>Broken sword tip, turned into a stream of light, instant impact.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The sword tip pierced the space, dragging out a series of spatial ripples, towards Liu Ruyan straight forced.
<br><br>PS: Don't be in a hurry, the good show is still in the background, guaranteed wonderful ha.
