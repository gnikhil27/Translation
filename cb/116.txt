"Gah!"
<br><br>This glance.
<br><br>It almost made the night wind centipede's eyes explode.
<br><br>It was like having a fish spike stuck in his throat, his brain was dazed, and intense fear rose up in his heart.
<br><br>This is the man, a shovel shot dead black feather, and tied away the Bo Gu Demon Emperor with a grass rope, the thought of this, he did not have any battle, only want to save his life.
<br><br>The eyes rolled, the countless calves glared, belly flopped, and fell to the ground without the slightest expectation.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"Night wind centipede?"
<br><br>"Night Wind Centipede what are you doing?"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede's strange state immediately caused the Eagle King's two people to react, and the two people passed out a drink. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>However, no matter how the two people shouted, the Night Wind Centipede lying on the ground froze without half a response.
<br><br>But now the eagle king and snake king can not care about him, after a glance at each other, the two body size increased sharply, as an eagle and a snake towards Yi Feng attack.
<br><br>However, a few feet away from Yi Feng range, the two demons heart will be a thud.
<br><br>They found that they had far underestimated the so-called toxin, because the few demon spirits that were still able to support them before, now also died quickly and turned into their bodies and fell to the ground.
<br><br>And the two of them under this toxin, the body power also quickly depleted, not even enough to support the body that became larger, and soon returned to its original size.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This this this ...... is what is going on?"
<br><br>The two great demon kings widened their eyes and shouted with panic on their faces, but their bodies could not raise their native strength and could only lie helplessly on the ground.
<br><br>"Damn human, so despicable!"
<br><br>The Eagle King lay on the ground, his mouth cursing viciously.
<br><br>"Quick, call for backup."
<br><br>The snake king was even worse than the eagle king, his body was writhing violently on the ground, and the skin was worn under the violent friction.
<br><br>Eagle King did not dare to delay, using the last ounce of strength in his body, hit a stream of light to fly out.
<br><br>And at this time, heard the movement of Yi Feng woke up.
<br><br>This does not look not know, a look down a jump, this is only how long will ah, around so many beasts came?
<br><br>"My medicine is really awesome ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng can't help but boast, originally thought only to prevent a little snake insects, but did not expect what roe deer ah, wearing mountain armor ah, etc. are dead a large number of.
<br><br>"What a sin!"
<br><br>Looking at this ground full of corpses, Yi Feng quite some in the heart, but see the ground that the dying snake, but could not help it.
<br><br>Smacked his lips, and grabbed that snake with one hand.
<br><br>"Just haven't eaten anything, recently eat barbecue every day or something, mouth full of bubbles, get a snake soup to fill the stomach at the same time and then clear the fire!" Yi Feng mouth murmured, from the small bamboo basket inside took out a small pot, and boiled a pot of boiling water, the snake cut, then thrown in.
<br><br>"Snake ...... snake king!!!?"
<br><br>The whole city witnessed all of this, the eagle king stared in disbelief, watching his companion die so tragically, his heart immediately set off waves of shock.
<br><br>At the same time, the monstrous anger and humiliation rose, he struggled with his body, desperately mobilizing the power in his body, attempting to disperse the toxins in his body.
<br><br>However, at that moment, his subconscious glance, but almost scared his soul.
<br><br>By the water pool, by the rocks, on the dead tree, hanging with a grass rope, was it not the Bo Gu Martial Emperor that they had been thinking about so hard?
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Eagle King snapped to reaction.
<br><br>It turned out that it was that abominable and terrifying human who had captured the Bo Gu Demon Emperor in front of him.
<br><br>Can't help but, his body shivered coldly, shivering violently, and at the same time, he also became fighting spirit, coupled with the urging of the medicinal power, his eyelids became increasingly heavy ......
<br><br>But at this time, a voice came.
<br><br>"This and a hawk ah, then tonight's meal is better."
<br><br>This sentence, directly became the last straw that pressed dao him, the eagle king directly fainted.
<br><br>After a sleep refreshed Yi Feng mouth humming a little song, began to clean up this a snake and an eagle, and in his busy work, the periphery of a centipede leg claws moved, then crawled violently, disappeared.
<br><br>"It's terrible, it's terrible!"
<br><br>Running all the way, the night wind centipede heart palpitations.
<br><br>Especially remembering the Eagle King and Snake King's miserable state, he was even more cold sweat, originally Bo Gu Demon Emperor and several other treasures he did not have the effort to think about anymore, just want to escape from this mountain range.
<br><br>However, he just ran not much farther, an earth-shaking sound came out, rushing towards him.
<br><br>The visitor, it was a dozen other demon kings, they received the distress of the Eagle King and Snake King, they gathered all the demon beasts in the Bo Gu territory at the fastest speed and rushed towards the place of the incident.
<br><br>Seeing this, the night wind centipede heart a thud, cold sweat.
<br><br>Once they know that the Snake King Eagle King has died, and he himself escaped, is this not?
<br><br>Rolling his eyes ......
<br><br>His heart was ruthless, decisively stomped off two legs.
<br><br>Hesitated for a moment, and stared off one, dying to crawl on the ground ......
<br><br>And the first-class demon king, led by the leopard king, the matter also saw the night wind centipede crawling on the ground with difficulty, immediately rushed to, soberly asked: "Night wind demon spirit, you, you this is ......?"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede swung up its tail and interrupted the Leopard King's words.
<br><br>Under countless pairs of eyes, he used up the last ounce of strength in his body as if he had used up the last ounce of strength in his body, and with difficulty, he delivered his voice.
<br><br>"Don't say more and don't ask more questions."
<br><br>"Seriously disabled."
<br><br>"Almost!"
<br><br>"Go to ......."
