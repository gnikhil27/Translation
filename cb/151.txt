"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>However, what she didn't expect was that Ao Qing suddenly laughed out loud.
<br><br>In the laughter, there was also a strong mockery.
<br><br>It was so ear-piercing!
<br><br>What was going on here?
<br><br>In front of something like the Demon King Pill, shouldn't Ao Qing directly agree to her conditions?
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng frowned and looked at Ao Qing with a face full of ice and asked, "What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>"I'm laughing at the fact that you actually think a small Demon King Dan can impress me!"
<br><br>Ao Qing said nonchalantly.
<br><br>At that, Ao Qingcheng's face was immediately covered with frost, and her body was even surging with killing intent, her icy pupils staring deadly at Ao Qing and saying coldly: "Your appetite is too big, a Demon King Pill, do you know how many people in the tribe can only dream of it, let alone you, a trash who has been expelled from the tribe!"
<br><br>"Humph, ignorant!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Ao Qing coldly snorted in disdain.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's eyes were cold and she was about to get angry.
<br><br>However, at this moment, Ao Qing, who was full of disdain, suddenly had powerful aura fluctuations erupt from his body.
<br><br>Also at the same time, his front claws fell down with a bang, accompanied by a powerful force that suddenly landed on the ground.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>The ground collapsed under this claw of Ao Qing, while countless cracks in the ground were like spider webs cracking in all directions.
<br><br>"This ...... is?"
<br><br>"This fluctuation?"
<br><br>Feeling the fluctuations coming from Ao Qing's body and the power of this claw fall, Ao Qingcheng's face, which was always covered with frost, finally changed, revealing an incredible expression, looking at Ao Qing in shock.
<br><br>"You actually ......"
<br><br>"Not bad, I have long been the realm of Demon King."
<br><br>Ao Qing was full of pride, staring at Ao Qingcheng full of mockery, "So a Demon King Dan but, little master I simply do not look at."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's pretty face was blue with anger, and her chest was heaving violently.
<br><br>Of course, more than the anger in her heart, Ao Qing Demon King's realm made her unable to calm down.
<br><br>A talent of the most crotchety waste, and was also expelled from the tribe, to survive is already an incredible thing, but actually reached the demon king realm?
<br><br>After a long time, she looked at Ao Qing again and said, "I really did not expect that you have impressed me for a while."
<br><br>"But, so what?"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng raised her lofty eyes again and said condescendingly, "In the eyes of my Demon Emperor realm, one is always an ant as well, but nonetheless, this Demon King Pill really can't impress you anymore."
<br><br>Saying that, she waved her jade hand and put away the Demon King Pill in her hand.
<br><br>"Then I'll make you a new promise!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng threw out another benefit and said, "As long as you are willing to return to the clan with me to open the secret realm, after I breakthrough from the Demon Emperor Demon Sect, I will mobilize the resources of the clan, while personally helping you to promote to the Demon Emperor realm, you know my talent, also know my position in the clan, want to do all this is not a pipe dream, within ten years to ensure that it can be done."
<br><br>After saying that, Ao Qingcheng looked at Ao Qing with confidence.
<br><br>Although she did not know what kind of luck Ao Qing had gotten, from a tribal waste to grow to the Demon King realm, but in front of this kind of y confusion of becoming a Demon Emperor realm, she did not believe that she could not impress Ao Qing.
<br><br>However, what she didn't expect was that Ao Qing still didn't say yes, and a disdainful voice came out.
<br><br>"Ten years?"
<br><br>"Cut!"
<br><br>After saying that, Ao Qing skipped his head.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng never thought that Ao Qing could actually still resist y confusion, but remembering the importance of that secret realm, she could only endure it and continued to increase the code, "Good, then I will give you another promise, as long as the secret realm is opened, I will allow you to pick a divine weapon in it that is infinitely close to the Saint grade, as your weapon."
<br><br>After saying that, Ao Qingcheng's leisurely gaze continued to look directly at Ao Qing.
<br><br>She didn't believe that Ao Qing wouldn't change his mind.
<br><br>But what made her furious was that Ao Qing actually really showed a disdainful look once again.
<br><br>If she didn't have a deep scruple against Ao Qingcheng, the dog almost laughed directly, but even so, she almost suffocated her internal injuries.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>"That for you, is infinitely close to the sacred divine weapon, such a powerful thing, I'm afraid you've never seen it in your life!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's body emitted a cold intent as she emitted a morose cold voice.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>This sentence of Ao Qingcheng finally made the dog Ao Qing couldn't hold back, after a poof, then let out a loud laugh.
