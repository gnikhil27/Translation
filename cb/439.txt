The afterglow of the sunset came spilling down with a dusky glow, and the earth was covered with a golden color.
<br><br>In the courtyard.
<br><br>Yi Feng is playing chess with Xiaodai.
<br><br>"Yi Feng brother, I tell you ha, recently the sect inside came a few old men, living in the next woods over, always intentionally or unintentionally looking towards us, a look at it is known not good people." Little dance whispered towards Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"En, these few people I have long found." Yi Feng, holding a chess piece in his hand, also nodded seriously and said, "It really doesn't look like any good people."
<br><br>"I feel like they look like peeping toms, don't believe you look to the side." Little dance again whispered to remind.
<br><br>At the word.
<br><br>Yi Feng gaze lightly glanced away.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Three men and a woman were pretending to hang out in a small forest not far away, but all kinds of sneaky looking towards this side.
<br><br>"En, according to this period of prying, this high person should be the kind of experience life." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"This also explains why he joined a small sect like the Green Ox Sect, just to experience life and play on earth."
<br><br>"Fortunately, we did not reveal our breath, so we can also pretend to be mortals to approach the seniors, it is easier to draw closer relations."
<br><br>"Hmph, is it useful to reveal or not to reveal in front of him, can people still not know who we are?"
<br><br>"You say this, knowing is one thing, picking apart is another, this senior if he knows that we are Martial Emperors, but also pretend to be mortal to accompany him to have fun, may still leave a good impression on us."
<br><br>"When you say so, it seems to make some sense ......"
<br><br>Various voices came from the four people.
<br><br>The faces, too, were filled with a strong yearning.
<br><br>After all, it is now infinitely close to the seniors ah, as long as the time comes, the opportunity is not handy.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's body couldn't help but burst out with an aura.
<br><br>"Grass."
<br><br>"Can not be suppressed again."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian cursed and tried to flee, but found the remaining three people full of ice coldness blocking his way.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian, we need an explanation."
<br><br>"Yes, we need an explanation!"
<br><br>"If you don't tell us the truth today, you won't be able to leave!"
<br><br>The three questioned out loud.
<br><br>"Heh ......"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian rubbed the back of his head and explained with a face full of embarrassment, "I was also surprised that our family's Sword Emperor legacy is actually so powerful that it will soon allow me to break through the Ten Destiny Martial Emperors."
<br><br>"Put your mother's fart, your what's-his-name Sword Emperor is also a Ten Life Martial Emperor, what the hell inheritance is faster than his own breakthrough?"
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>"Hurry up and say, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>The three men looked intently at each other, and approached Jian Hengtian step by step.
<br><br>The lie was picked up with a single word, and Jian Hengtian instantly knew that he couldn't hide it anymore.
<br><br>Only thick skin, stammering and began to explain.
<br><br>"Actually, it's nothing ......"
<br><br>"That is, is the last time in a line of valley, picked up a little scraps."
<br><br>"Hey, so it's, so it's accidentally to the ten lives."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's words instantly reminded the three of the snake soup that was poured on the ground in the First Line Valley.
<br><br>At once, their eyes widened and their intestines were about to turn blue with regret.
<br><br>Sense.
<br><br>The reason why Jian Hengtian had broken through so quickly was because he had secretly licked the snake soup that had been poured on the ground clean.
<br><br>Three people that hate ah!
<br><br>This is simply a plum three times.
<br><br>Three great opportunities had slipped through their fingers!
<br><br>"Good for you Jian Hengtian, to have such a chance to actually swallow it privately and not tell us, you are really good at heart."
<br><br>"That's right, I said at that time how you walked and disappeared, and said it was shit, it turned out to be a person to eat alone to go."
<br><br>"You also lied to us that it was the sword emperor inheritance, lying to us really miserable ah!"
<br><br>The more the three said, the angrier they became, and the jealousy in their hearts made them look at Jian Hengtian in a different way.
<br><br>Looking at the three people who were approaching, Jian Hengtian shivered and backed up.
<br><br>"What are you guys doing?"
<br><br>"Don't be reckless."
<br><br>"Impulsiveness is the devil, remember that we are now mortals ah ......"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Before the words left his mouth, there was a miserable scream.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian was kicked to the ground by three people, followed by an overwhelming onslaught of fists.
<br><br>The bruised and swollen Jian Hengtian spat out a mouthful of mud and turned around to crush Yun Tianlong back to the ground.
<br><br>"Damn, I am at least ten lives, afraid of you guys, before I told you to eat you hard to pretend, now do not drink and blame me, right?"
<br><br>And seeing Yun Tianlong being suppressed, Liu Gu Yi and Li Canghai pounced towards Jian Hengtian again.
<br><br>For a while.
<br><br>The four of them fought hard, and because they did not dare to reveal their cultivation, they fought with the means of mortals.
<br><br>Under the physical combat, several people's clothes torn thin, that picture simply can not bear to see.
<br><br>"Good boy."
<br><br>"Three men and a woman, so heavy taste."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the four people tumbling together from afar, and immediately frowned.
<br><br>These few people often sneak around at my door, it is likely that they value my handsome, thinking about how to assassinate me ......
<br><br>This white and clean body of mine, if I fall into their path, it is likely ......
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but fight a shiver.
<br><br>Immediately vowed to keep a distance from these few people.
