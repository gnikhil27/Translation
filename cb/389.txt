Yi Feng's heart set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>He never thought that he would actually hear this familiar tune here.
<br><br>For some reason, this tune played out from someone else's hands, for a moment, made his eyes unable to stop the tears in his eyes.
<br><br>How many years has it been since I last heard this tune!
<br><br>Just how can this Morsihan play the nocturne?
<br><br>A crossover?
<br><br>Could it be that he saw his hometown in the other world?
<br><br>Yi Feng's palms could not help but tremble, but the song is in progress, it is not good to interrupt, he just suppressed the excitement in his heart, waiting for the time to pass.
<br><br>Finally, when the sound of the zither fell, the crowd was still applauding, Yi Feng had come to the side of Mor Sihan.
<br><br>"Girl, how did you know this song?" Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Sir has heard it?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Mor Sihan lifted her beautiful eyes and asked with the same surprise.
<br><br>"Yes, I've heard it and I can play it, so this tune of yours, how on earth do you know it?" Yi Feng said with a slight urgency in his voice.
<br><br>Strange Sihan looked at Yi Feng and laughed softly, "I never thought that you could play it too, what a coincidence, only that I got this song by chance coincidence, honestly I don't know where it came from."
<br><br>"Coincidence?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned slightly.
<br><br>Could it be that this person is not a crossover?
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Mor Sihan, couldn't help but try again and asked softly, "Can the girl ever hear a saying?"
<br><br>"Please speak, sir."
<br><br>Strange Sihan asked.
<br><br>"This year's holiday does not receive gifts, receive gifts only ...... ah ......," Yi Feng raised his eyebrows towards Struthers Han, indicating Struthers Han.
<br><br>But to Yi Feng's surprise, Mor Sihan was blank, seemingly completely unaware of what Yi Feng was talking about.
<br><br>"That little sunflower classroom is open, the child cold old bad ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng again gestured to the stranger Sihan, eyes full of expectation.
<br><br>Strange Sihan more confused.
<br><br>"Then this, this you have not heard, the end of the sky is my love, sheepish green mountains at the foot of the flowers are blooming ......"
<br><br>"Heard of it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"Ransom Sihan ignorant, did not understand what sir was saying." Mor Sihan bowed his head and apologized.
<br><br>"Okay, fine."
<br><br>Yi Feng lowered his head in a slightly depressed mood, smiled apologetically at Mor Sihan, then sat back in his seat, raised his wine glass towards everyone and said, "Come, come, come, drink together."
<br><br>Forced smile, the drink through the intestines, Yi Feng raised his head to look out the window of the fine rain, nose a little sour.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>Homesick ......
<br><br>Small island.
<br><br>A piece of darkness.
<br><br>Wind whistling, rain drizzling down.
<br><br>Next to the stone, a bald man crossed his legs, pursed his fingers and dipped his tongue in some saliva, and turned the book in his hand to the next page, while he glanced his eyes to the side.
<br><br>"Stupid than!"
<br><br>Spat out a sentence and continued to put his mind into the book.
<br><br>"Shiver ......"
<br><br>And next to him, a divine soul body body was hunched over and shivering while trembling.
<br><br>It was Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>"Damn, where did all the people die."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's face was black.
<br><br>This broken island, not only a shadow of a person, on the fucking even see a few things, in addition to some broken tarpaulin is that a dozen of his poor subordinates.
<br><br>But now his soul body can not be rescued, and again, do not want to be alarmed by the snake to spoil the big event.
<br><br>So, with nothing to gain he could only stay here and wait.
<br><br>"Hold on Su Xuanjun, you are the hall of a continent master, this little storm is nothing!"
<br><br>"You're just a little unlucky that they're not here, there's still time, wait a bit, you can definitely wait until they come back."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun secretly comforted himself.
<br><br>But this wait, is a day and night.
<br><br>Until the next morning, only to see a large number of people with boats from the distant shore rowing.
<br><br>"Sir, those six people ran away, should we just let it go?" An old man whispered in Yi Feng's ear.
<br><br>"Just a bunch of hot chickens, if they ran away, they ran away."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, not caring at all, his heart was still thinking about the matter of Strange Sihan.
<br><br>For the time being, regardless of whether Mor Sihan is a traveler, that she can play night music, it means he must have seen a traveler.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng and its heart stirring.
<br><br>Very anxious to see that travellers ......
<br><br>In the thoughts, the boat is getting closer and closer to the island, and will soon be disembarked.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun, who had waited for a day and a night and whose spirit was depressed, his eyes immediately lit up.
<br><br>"Ha."
<br><br>"After keeping the clouds, you have finally returned."
<br><br>"This time, this continent lord vows to find out clearly who you guys are and what strength you have."
<br><br>He got up with a slap on his thigh and urged his divine soul to approach towards Yi Feng and the others.
<br><br>But just two steps, a swish sound, the soul turned into nothingness ......
<br><br>Also at the same time, Su Xuanjun, who was far away in the immortal world, awoke and immediately roared madly.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The furious man waved his palm of muddy power and smashed the retreat room he was in into ruins.
<br><br>But even so, he was still trembling with anger.
<br><br>The first time he went there, he was killed on his ass, that's all.
<br><br>But this time, he endured the torture and waited for a day and a night, so he could easily expect people to return, the duration of the god soul is up.
<br><br>Two dead prisoners and consumed the mind aside, these two divine soul body but fully consumed his two drops of blood ah!
<br><br>He was practically trembling in his heart.
<br><br>"Damn it, I don't believe it."
<br><br>The black-faced Su Xuanjun ran back to the death row, grabbed another dead prisoner, went to a new retreat room, and re-consecrated the divine soul.
<br><br>A day passed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>The sky cleared.
<br><br>"The sun is nice!"
<br><br>Yi Feng on the island looked up at the big sun in the sky, remembered the things inside the Ring of Space, and hastily took them out while people were not around.
<br><br>"Before all wet by the rain, have to be a good sunshine."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked for open space and took out the sun one by one.
<br><br>However, the island has a large number of trees, plus he has a lot of things, in order to catch the sun, so the shore of the island without shade, dense sunbathing are Yi Feng's things.
<br><br>Just then, on the shore outside the island, a slight fluctuation came from the space, Su Xuanjun's newly sacrificed divine soul, once again descended to the island.
<br><br>Looking at the passing crowd on the island, he instantly raised his lips.
<br><br>"This time, I'll see what other surprises there are."
<br><br>Saying that, he rushed towards the island with conviction.
