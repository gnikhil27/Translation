"Snappy snappy snappy ......"
<br><br>"Tie la qua la ......"
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>Firecrackers rang out above the small island.
<br><br>Today is an important day, is the official opening day of the island.
<br><br>Shake the sky Que two old man fortunately, invited a new batch of brick and tile wall mason not to mention, at the same time Yi Feng taught Ye Bei burned bricks, but also piled up a lot of finished products.
<br><br>I believe that not later, a new sect will be able to rise.
<br><br>And on the side, shaking the sky Que two old man stroking his moustache, standing there with his head held high.
<br><br>Behind them, there are strong people they have tried every possible way to find from all regions of the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>The lowest, is also six life martial emperor!
<br><br>The devil knows how many mouths were worn when they were first approached, how many vows were made, and how long it took to pull them over with bitter words. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Today, it's finally time for them to raise their eyebrows.
<br><br>Because look at the look of their group of people, a pair of eyes staring straight at the pile of bricks on the ground will know that this group of people will be submissive next.
<br><br>And in the future on the island, must also look at their faces to speak.
<br><br>What's wrong with the Martial Emperor?
<br><br>Outside you bully, here you still bully a try?
<br><br>Our two old men are the managers appointed by Mr. Who dares to break the law?
<br><br>"What's your hurry, haven't you seen the world?"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que looked behind this group of bricklayers martial emperor, he raised his voice and shouted.
<br><br>"That's it, does the order understand?"
<br><br>"When you get here, it's not in the place you used to be, everything has to be done by eye."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng also helped out, with his hands behind his back, glaring at the crowd leisurely.
<br><br>Faced with two old men whose ranks were a great deal lower than theirs scolding, the crowd of Martial Emperors really lowered their heads.
<br><br>They are not blind, the pile of bricks not to mention, just walking casually on the island every person, they feel the trembling of their souls.
<br><br>So, in this case, who dares to act rashly?
<br><br>However, the hot in their eyes but still can not hide, the palms of their feet lightly crushed the ground, like an arrow on the string of the bow, has long been impatient to go over to move the bricks.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>"Let's get to work!"
<br><br>Yi Feng, the leader, shouted after holding a simple ceremony.
<br><br>"Da da da da da da da ......"
<br><br>Just after the voice fell, a dense sound of stomping on the ground rang out.
<br><br>It was to see the group of bricklayers behind Shake Heavenly Que and them, as if they had gone crazy and pounced towards the pile of bricks.
<br><br>"This brick ......"
<br><br>"Mhhhhhhhh!"
<br><br>"Mua mua mua ......"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>Then we saw, holding the bricks in their hands, they let out a loud laugh, some hugged the bricks with a big kiss, some pounced on the bricks, completely a vicious wolf pounced on the food.
<br><br>"This group of bricklayers, not too enthusiastic!"
<br><br>Looking at this group of people, Yi Feng was incredulous.
<br><br>But soon, he revealed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>He had to admit that there were a few points that were not comparable to this place in his previous life. That is the purity of the people in this world, as well as the politeness, and the love for their work ......
<br><br>Take these bricklayers in front of you, they simply love their work to the extreme.
<br><br>This is not, just the beginning, they have already started to work frantically, moving bricks, bricklaying walls ......
<br><br>And seeing that the things they arranged finally satisfied the gentleman, the two old men, Shake Tian Que and Guan Yun Peng, also finally breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"However, on this island, it seems that we two are the most garbage, right?" Shake Tian Que said in a small voice.
<br><br>"Yes, we are the most garbage."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng lamented softly, "The most envious is your disciple, with the help of sir, he directly refined so many immortal grade immortal bricks, his future is boundless!"
<br><br>"Ahem, that is also his own fate, I just think about when we can get a little bit of the opportunity given by the gentleman." Shake the sky Que said.
<br><br>"Don't be anxious, when the time comes, it will always be given." Shake Tian Que lectured.
<br><br>Shake Tian Que lowered his head not to speak and nodded reassuringly.
<br><br>"Hey, you two old men, eat sugar beans or not?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted towards the two old men of Shake Tian Que.
<br><br>The two people were busy raising their heads and looked at Yi Feng suspiciously.
<br><br>"Here, buy you guys some candy."
<br><br>Yi Feng also ignored them, and directly threw the two sugar pills in his hand over.
<br><br>This sugar pill is skeleton Ben Wei gave him, along with a small knife, and do not know where to get.
<br><br>The sugar pills he tried one, sour it.
<br><br>But throw away a pity, so just give the two old men it.
<br><br>As for this dagger ......
<br><br>Yi Feng took a look at it, it is not good, it is estimated that the skeleton Ben Wei picked up from which garbage pile, casually put into the pocket, Yi Feng went away.
<br><br>The two old men were stunned in place, with tears of excitement left in their eyes.
<br><br>"What a dense power."
<br><br>"This elixir, I'm afraid it's not an elixir anymore, it's an immortal elixir!"
<br><br>"Oooh, really, we did our best to help sir work, sir will never treat us badly."
<br><br>The two old men, bowed towards Yi Feng's leaving back.
<br><br>Yi Feng found Ye Bei and told them to temporarily put aside the work in hand and go with him to the martial arts school to move things.
<br><br>After all, today he is considered to have completely moved to the island, so Yi Feng wanted to move the daily necessities ah, as well as some of his favorite things over.
<br><br>Of course the martial arts school is still the martial arts school, when there is nothing he will still go back to live a.
<br><br>Yi Feng took Ye Bei and others, back and forth for two or three days, finally moved a lot of things over to the martial arts school.
<br><br>Usually neatly arranged, it does not look like much.
<br><br>But piece by piece count down, is really fucking much and messy.
<br><br>More to the island's open space, under the trees, rocks, everywhere is full of Yi Feng from the martial arts school moved over things.
<br><br>Such as his book ah, the courtyard recliner ah, bushel fan ah, umbrella ah, and so on miscellaneous ......
<br><br>Immortal world.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun has been in seclusion since the day of the black feather.
<br><br>It is said to be a retreat, in fact, it is hiding.
<br><br>These days of hiding, not a day is good, the whole day to worry about.
<br><br>But at this moment, he suddenly remembered what is not right.
<br><br>"That boat guy, and that monk, should not have survived in the world ah!"
<br><br>"Their identity, it seems to be only self-conjecture, there is no other supporting evidence ah?"
<br><br>"So, that boat-supporting and that monk, if not the two I guessed, then that white-robed man Yi Feng, is not as powerful as imagined."
<br><br>He was inside the hall back and forth ferry not.
<br><br>He thought and thought and felt as if he really scared himself this time.
<br><br>So, he raised his head.
<br><br>A major decision was made in his mind.
<br><br>"I'm going to take a trip to that island again and explore it properly."
