"Grass."
<br><br>"This guy said explode, and did not give me a warning to senior brother."
<br><br>Li Jin cursed and drew his legs to run.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>A blasting sound rang out.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>With Hong's crazy self-explosion as the center point, a huge mushroom cloud immediately rose in the sky.
<br><br>The sky and the earth changed color.
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>Countless violent energy surged out in all directions, spreading out as a circle of shock waves.
<br><br>The ground exploded into a big crater. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Under the shock wave, countless buildings of the Heavenly Spirit Sect collapsed, while countless people were also tossed by the shock wave.
<br><br>The surrounding area is a mess, a lot of holes.
<br><br>As for the scope of the Hong crazy explosion, whether those watching the spectators, or the Heavenly Spirit Sect's Law Enforcement Hall, a not left all dead.
<br><br>The good ones can still have a personal appearance, the miserable ones have long been mother did not recognize, the ground is full of limbs and broken legs.
<br><br>Wailing all around.
<br><br>"Crazy, crazy, simply crazy."
<br><br>"Run."
<br><br>Under the many wailing voices, the remaining onlookers scattered in all directions and hurriedly moved away from the center of the battlefield.
<br><br>"Damn, damn damn damn!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong's face was so gloomy that water could drip out of it, his body even trembled violently, and his eyes were even covered with blood.
<br><br>His Law Enforcement Hall ......
<br><br>His law enforcement hall ......
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Sect's main battle force, ah, so instantly destroyed by the group.
<br><br>His heart was dripping blood.
<br><br>"Die, die die die, I want all of you to die, I don't care what kind of power your Heaven and Earth Sect is, what kind of source is behind it, none of you will ever walk out of my Heavenly Spirit Sect!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong gritted his teeth and trembled as a word came out from his body.
<br><br>"Elders listen to the order, all those who are related to them, all of them will be killed on the spot for me!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong roared.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>As his voice fell, dozens of figures flew up in unison and stepped out of the air from the direction of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"The depth of the Heavenly Spirit Sect really surpasses everyone's expectations!"
<br><br>"Yes, I can't imagine that the Heavenly Spirit Sect actually has so many elders, the lowest strength of which is not to mention the late Golden Immortal, the ten or so at the head, even to the Xuan Immortal realm."
<br><br>"It seems that these few people from the Heaven and Earth Sect, I'm afraid they can't get away today!"
<br><br>"Such a lineup is indeed terrifying, but in addition to those old monsters who do not appear in the world, all the high-end battle power of the Heavenly Spirit Sect should be here!"
<br><br>"It's worth it to get all the elders of the Heavenly Spirit Sect to come out and eliminate, not to mention the fact that that madman just pulled the entire Law Enforcement Hall to accompany him!"
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Seeing this terrifying lineup of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, the people who had retreated to the outside of the battle circle, there were all kinds of comments.
<br><br>Seeing so many experts, Su Yunyun's eyes picked.
<br><br>"Eighteenth senior brother is still a bit impulsive after all, self-destructing so early, leaving senior sister me to face so many people alone, it's really a lot of pressure."
<br><br>She couldn't help but give a bitter smile.
<br><br>Then she turned her gaze to Xiao Zhan who was on the side.
<br><br>Seeing this, Xiao Zhan hurriedly braced his body and stood up, gritting his teeth and saying firmly with his eyes, "Senior sister, I am not afraid of death, I will fight together with you, just do as you command!"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"You think too much, not to that extent."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun froze, quite embarrassed.
<br><br>"I just want to tell you, don't forget to find a bag later to pick up your eighteenth senior brother's corpse bones, in a couple of days we might be able to put together a whole again."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan froze.
<br><br>But after reacting, he asked in horror, "Senior sister, you mean, eighteenth senior brother, not dead?"
<br><br>Xiao Yun also cast his shocked gaze over.
<br><br>"Except for the senior, if he doesn't want to die himself, who can kill him, it's just a matter of time to put it back together again, go, I'll deal with them, I'll leave this matter to you guys." Su Yun Yun Yun instructed.
<br><br>After saying that, she remembered something and added: "By the way, don't be missing parts."
<br><br>"Yes, senior sister, leave this matter to me."
<br><br>Hearing that Hong Crazy was not dead, Xiao Zhan excitedly answered.
<br><br>Xiao Yun, on the other hand, had cold sweat rising from his forehead.
<br><br>This son of his, what kind of demonic clan did he add!
<br><br>Let his son become immortal on the ground is just, he is still the first time to see the self-destruction of people can still come back alive.
<br><br>What's more, Su Yunyun face such a powerful lineup, but actually no point of false, but also lightly account for these ......
<br><br>This little sense of crisis is not.
<br><br>Is it too undisciplined some?
<br><br>At least face, is also the first big sect in the South Region ah!
<br><br>"Senior brother Li Jin, are you sure you don't want to help senior sister you to a sword?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun again inclined her head and saw that guy was still digging his nose, her brow couldn't help but frown and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Hey, senior sister, if I come to a sword and then cooperate with you, how meaningless ah."
<br><br>Li Jin picked his nose again and said with a smile, "I'd better help senior brother Xiao Zhan to collect the corpse of the eighteenth senior brother, in case of leakage or something eighteenth senior brother still not blame?"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Okay okay."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun breathlessly held the forehead, said leisurely: "It seems that this group of guys can only your senior sister to deal with ah!"
<br><br>"Just in time."
<br><br>"Your senior sister I also have not killed for a long time it ......"
<br><br>The voice only just fell, Su Yun Yun Yun's ghostly body had already disappeared, and when she reappeared, she was already in front of Yin Tianxiong and the others.
<br><br>This immediately ushered in countless people's shouts of surprise.
<br><br>They never expected that Su Yunyun, in the face of such a formation, would actually advance instead of retreating and strike first with one against many.
<br><br>"Humph, don't know how high the sky is!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong was furious and covered Su Yunyun with a monstrous palm.
<br><br>At the same time, the rest of the elders also sacrificed various weapons and cast various immortal spells, striking at Su Yunyun from all directions.
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>The sky was filled with the sound of explosions one after another.
<br><br>All kinds of violent qi enveloped the entire sky.
<br><br>Under the many powerful attacks, the air was all evaporated and directly turned into a vacuum.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>To everyone's surprise, Su Yun Yun Yun faced the siege of dozens of people and was actually at ease, not losing ground in the slightest.
<br><br>On the contrary, from time to time, there were elders in the Heavenly Spirit Sect's camp who were hit by Su Yun Yun's attacks and smashed down from the sky.
<br><br>"What a bizarre attack, who the hell are you? And what exactly is your Heaven and Earth Sect's power?"
<br><br>Having no way to take Su Yunyun for a while, Yin Tianxiong immediately revealed a look of anger and frustration.
<br><br>It was clear that Su Yun Yun was only at the cultivation level of Xuan Xian, not much higher than him, but he never expected that she would still be able to swim with ease under the siege of so many people.
<br><br>"You are not qualified to know yet."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun laughed coldly, still dealing with the crowd's siege with ease.
<br><br>Even though her strength alone was not much higher than these people.
<br><br>But she was an Immortal Emperor in her previous life.
<br><br>Ask, which immortal emperor is not stepping on endless dead bones, which immortal emperor is not experienced thousands of battles to raise up?
<br><br>So Su Yun Yun has a combat experience that is beyond the reach of ordinary people.
<br><br>Compared to her previous life, what is this siege in front of her?
<br><br>Another moment passed, Su Yun Yun Yun was still relaxed, while seven or eight more people from the Heavenly Spirit Sect had fallen.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yin Tianxiong finally couldn't sit still and shouted with his sword: "Senior brother, Tianling is in trouble, so I hope senior brother will come out to relieve the siege!"
<br><br>Once Yin Tianxiong's voice fell.
<br><br>Deep inside the Heavenly Spirit Sect, a pair of scarlet eyes opened abruptly.
<br><br>A breath rose from the ground, like a sharp sword attack.
<br><br>Then it was seen, a man in white swept in, a strand of white hair in front of the forehead is particularly striking.
