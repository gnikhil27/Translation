A few days down the road, Yuan Jing took Yi Feng around the entire Yuan City.
<br><br>The food and drinks are almost all arranged properly for Yi Feng.
<br><br>The most important thing is, so many days down, Yi Feng did not spend a penny.
<br><br>This has to make Yi Feng sigh, this sister is really good.
<br><br>Today is the last stop of the Yuancheng tour, came to the most famous Wenxi Lake in Yuancheng.
<br><br>The scenery here is beautiful, every night will be released lanterns, countless talented people gathered so, but also the hearts of countless couples of holy land.
<br><br>"That senior, can I change my name?" Yuan Jing walked beside Yi Feng, bouncing around, and suddenly summoned up the courage to ask.
<br><br>"What do you want to call it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked, inclining his head.
<br><br>"For example, like ...... Big Brother Yi?"
<br><br>Yuan Jing will look expectantly at Yi Feng. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed, indifferent to the name calling or whatever, itself.
<br><br>"That's great."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng promise, Yuan Jing was excited like a child, running with open hands.
<br><br>One time make a face for Yi Feng.
<br><br>One day she would compel Yi Feng a little.
<br><br>One day, she picked a flower from the roadside, put it on her head naughtily and cutely, and asked Yi Feng if it looked good.
<br><br>But Yi Feng heart is not here, its eyes are always watching the surrounding.
<br><br>The heart is still in the mind, his last precious disciple.
<br><br>But the sight of a glance over, or the same as before, waterlogged flooded, drought, either super garbage, or lazy detection.
<br><br>Seeing that Yi Feng's mind was not on her body, Yuan Jing's beautiful eyes could not help but reveal a touch of darkness.
<br><br>However, it was quickly hidden, and as soon as she took Yi Feng's palm, she ran towards the distant viewing boat.
<br><br>"Yuan Jing!"
<br><br>Just at that moment, a cold voice came.
<br><br>The person who spoke was a white-robed youth who was looking at Yuan Jing with a face full of coldness.
<br><br>Yuan Jing's eyebrows instantly furrowed, "Bai Qiqu, what are you doing here?"
<br><br>"Heh, I should be the one to ask you that, right?" White robed youth Bai Qiqu said in a cold voice, then looked his icy gaze at Yi Feng on the side and said in a deep voice, "I'm asking you, who is he?"
<br><br>"Who he is is none of your business."
<br><br>Yuan Jing said with a frosty face, and pulled Yi Feng to leave towards the side.
<br><br>"No one is allowed to leave."
<br><br>Bai Qiqiu footsteps, directly stopped in front of Yi Feng two people, said in a deep voice: "Yuan Jing, you better know, but you and my brother have a marriage contract, if you do not make it clear today, the impact will not only be your own, but also your entire Yuan family!"
<br><br>"You shut up."
<br><br>Yuan Jing scolded, then her eyes hurriedly looked at Yi Feng and explained in a panic: "Brother Yi, don't listen to his nonsense, Bai Yanchun and I don't have a marriage contract at all, it was all forcibly placed by them for the sake of the family's interests, I never admitted it."
<br><br>At these words, Bai Qiqu's face was suddenly covered with frost.
<br><br>"Well well well Yuan Jing, you really can ah, in front of this wild man, so quickly want to set aside the relationship with my big brother, today if you do not say the words clearly, do not want to leave here."
<br><br>Bai Qiqu's aura was cold, stopping in front of the two without giving way in the slightest.
<br><br>Atmosphere.
<br><br>At once, the swords were drawn.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had not spoken, understood what was going on and took a step out to explain, "Friend, I think you misunderstood, I have no relationship with Miss Yuan."
<br><br>Yuan Jing bit her red lips tightly and did not say anything.
<br><br>But Bai Qiqu let out a cold laugh.
<br><br>"What are you, you say it's fine, do you think I'm blind?" Bai Qiqu said coldly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng's brow instantly frowned.
<br><br>This pussy.
<br><br>It was really unreasonable.
<br><br>"Get out of the way."
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't give a good face anymore, and a cold voice came out.
<br><br>"So what if I don't let you?"
<br><br>Bai Qiqu raised his condescending eyes and said with a face full of disdain.
<br><br>Visible anger crept up from Yi Feng's face and was about to strike.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yuan Jing hastily advised, "Brother Yi, why don't you forget it, although you are very strong, but Bai Qiqu is also very strong and has many cards."
<br><br>"Very strong?"
<br><br>"You say he's strong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng inclined his head to look at Yuan Jing.
<br><br>Almost laughed outright.
<br><br>With these words, directly asking Yuan Jing was not confident and asked dully, "Isn't it?"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Your eyesight, still need to put a little higher ah, he is just a super trash, with a broken sword in his hand and you can call it strong?" Yi Feng heart speechless, can not help but teach, secretly sigh this girl's vision is really too low.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>The corner of Yuan Jing's mouth could not help but twitch, subconsciously asked, "Big brother Yi, although I know you are very strong and strong, but what you said, is it not a little too conceited?"
<br><br>But she had just finished speaking.
<br><br>Just see Yi Feng kicked Bai Qi Drain out, accompanied by a miserable scream headfirst into the lake water.
<br><br>"Fuck you!"
<br><br>Cursing Yi Feng clapped his palm and didn't even look at the Bai Qiqu who flew out.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Immediately caused the surrounding crowd a variety of shrieks.
<br><br>Yuan Jing was even directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>One kick.
<br><br>Bai Qiqiu was defeated without resistance?
<br><br>Her mouth was a little dry.
<br><br>The beautiful eyes were filled with shock.
<br><br>Although he knew that Yi Feng would be stronger than Bai Qiqu, he never thought it would be so much stronger.
<br><br>She realized that Yi Feng just now was not conceited, but really had the capital to say this, in his eyes Bai Qiqu is really a super trash!
<br><br>At the same time, she also had some hard feelings in her heart.
<br><br>She found out that the gap between herself and Yi Feng was much bigger than she thought.
<br><br>Especially Yi Feng's teaching to her just now made her feel ashamed of herself, and a trace of inferiority complex arose in her heart.
<br><br>But her eyes were still full of worry, after all, behind the Bai Qi Drain was the entire Bai family.
<br><br>That was endless trouble.
<br><br>What's even more frightening is that behind the Bai family, there are even more terrifying forces backing them up.
<br><br>"Big brother Yi, I'm afraid you've gotten into trouble, there are more experts in the Bai family behind him, if you hurt Bai Qiqu, the Bai family will definitely not be willing to give up." Yuan Jing worried.
<br><br>"Then let's do it."
<br><br>Yi Feng spread his hands and said indifferently, "The hall of a son, just a trash goods, his that behind the white family is not much stronger, probably also a nest of trash."
