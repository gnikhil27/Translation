By evening, that martial spirit expert finally arrived at Hanchang City.
<br><br>His name was Jian Wuxin.
<br><br>A junior commander among the disciples within the Heavenly Demon Sect, of course the bottom kind, because all the other commanders were already Martial Kings.
<br><br>At this moment, he was kneeling respectfully next to Xue Qinzhu.
<br><br>"Did you hear clearly what I explained just now?" Xue Qinzhu asked once again, "You must understand at all times that you are a Martial Spirit expert, while we, are just a group of mortals."
<br><br>"Your Holiness, my subordinate understands, and will definitely do all this well." Jian Wuxin replied respectfully.
<br><br>"Well, as long as you successfully complete this one mission, I can break your rank and promote you." Xue Qinzhu added.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, thank you very much Sovereign."
<br><br>Jian Wuxin excitedly answered.
<br><br>"Alright then, wait here, I will go and inform Sir." Xue Qinzhu hurriedly instructed, then walked towards the inn.
<br><br>In the inn, Yi Feng's group of people were preparing for tomorrow's big action when Xue Qinzhu walked in and said, "Sir, that Martial Spirit expert has arrived!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly got up and said excitedly, "Quickly, quickly, everyone quickly go with me to greet this expert."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng enthusiastically went towards the door to welcome him.
<br><br>And Pork Rong, Grand Master Wang, Yang Tianyu, Li Shuhua, Fifth Tianming, Fifth Changkong, and a bunch of other subordinates also rushed with Yi Feng towards the outside.
<br><br>Outside the door.
<br><br>Jian Wuxin clutched his longsword in his hand, a faint aura of martial spirit lingering on his body.
<br><br>In his heart, thinking of Xue Qinzhu's promise to him and feel the secret joy, because only with the acting, this task is really easy ah.
<br><br>However, the next moment, his eyes glazed over.
<br><br>Almost fell headlong on the ground.
<br><br>This this this this ......
<br><br>These are?
<br><br>Blowing Snow Mountain Villa owner Fifth Tianming and young villa owner Fifth Changkong, Wind Cloud Valley Valley owner Yun Haotian and Wind Cloud Valley saint daughter Yun Xianque, Royal Sword Sect patriarch Yang Tianyu, Li family head Li Shuhua ......
<br><br>What kind of terrifying big brothers are these, all gathered together?
<br><br>All of a sudden, he who had just sworn to the truth, could not be calm at once.
<br><br>Body bones involuntarily trembling.
<br><br>Because this person, represents the pinnacle of Nansha ah!
<br><br>"Aiya, you're the martial spirit expert, right?" And at that moment, Yi Feng came up and asked enthusiastically.
<br><br>And seeing Yi Feng closer, Jian Wuxin's brain exploded all of a sudden.
<br><br>This one.
<br><br>This is not the supreme master?
<br><br>And the old man and the big man next to him, aren't these the two Martial Emperors?
<br><br>Ka!
<br><br>And that black robe, isn't this the same existence that exterminated the Demon Emperor?
<br><br>Whoops ......
<br><br>What the fuck, what a fucking lineup!
<br><br>Mommy, I want to go home ......
<br><br>But in between his confusion, Yi Feng suddenly bowed his body and clasped his fist, "Meet the expert, welcome the arrival of the expert."
<br><br>"Meet the expert, welcome the arrival of the expert."
<br><br>And Yang Tianyu, Yun Haotian, Grand Master Wang and others also followed Yi Feng and bowed one after another, sending out respectful voices towards Jian Wuxin.
<br><br>Kam!
<br><br>Looking at the way this group of superbosses respectfully treated him, Jian Wuxin was about to cry all of a sudden.
<br><br>He was a Martial Spirit, what kind of virtue was he capable of?
<br><br>Oh my god.
<br><br>Don't play with me like this, okay?
<br><br>This mission is not easy at all.
<br><br>Just now Xue Qinzhu hurriedly told him to act, but you didn't tell me that it was in front of this group of people!
<br><br>He looked at Xue Qinzhu for help.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu's face turned cold and she glared at him.
<br><br>Seeing this, Jian Wuxin gulped, quietly hid his trembling hands, put them behind his back, and stammered, "Ah, huh, no, no need to be polite."
<br><br>"An expert is too polite, please come in quickly."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly invited Jian Wuxin in, and then took a seat at the head seat.
<br><br>And looking at the people clustered on both sides, Jian Wuxin's body sat straight, hidden under the table's feet could not help but tremble, throat one by one had to swallow saliva, forehead also from time to time had to emerge with cold sweat.
<br><br>"Quickly, quickly pour a cup of tea for the high man." Yi Feng again hastily commanded.
<br><br>On hearing this, Yang Tianyu hurriedly poured a cup of tea for Jian Wuxin and respectfully pushed it to Jian Wuxin.
<br><br>Jian Wuxin looked at the tea in front of him and swallowed another mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>Is quite dry mouth.
<br><br>But, but he didn't dare to drink it!
<br><br>"High man, thank you for coming to help us in your busy schedule, after the matter is completed, you can say what you want to pay, as long as I can do it." Yi Feng said: "Of course, tomorrow the high man to give us pressure on the formation is good, the probability of not having to do it personally."
<br><br>That Yi Feng said is also right, after all, the opposite of that martial spirit expert always can not personally run to pick up the family.
<br><br>"Good ...... good to say."
<br><br>Jian Wuxin stammered in response, lowering his head to try to hide his panic.
<br><br>"Here's our plan."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the map again and told Jian Wuxin about the previous plan.
<br><br>Jian Wuxin was instantly confused.
<br><br>Such a group of bigwigs gathered together and plotted for so long just to steal a marriage?
<br><br>And to rob a small family that even he, Jian Wuxin, could not see?
<br><br>Is this how big brothers play?
<br><br>After going over the plan, Yi Feng waved his hand at the crowd and said, "I'm afraid the highbrow is going to rest, let's exit first!"
<br><br>At the words, the people have retreated.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng and others leave, Jian Wuxin immediately fell to the ground, deflated ......
