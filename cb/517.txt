At this time.
<br><br>The sky is another two streams of light cut.
<br><br>Then they saw two people standing in the air, looking down at the yellow sky beast that had just climbed out.
<br><br>"Who are these two people again?"
<br><br>"Where did they appear from?"
<br><br>Looking at the two people who suddenly appeared again, the two Wind and Cloud generals were baffled by the two monks.
<br><br>It was simply a complete mess.
<br><br>"These two people dare to take this stance and the Yellow Sky Beast, don't they want to die?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Feng Yun's second general stared dead on and couldn't help but murmur out.
<br><br>However. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just when they thought that the furious Yellow Sky Beast would slap the two to death, something eye-shocking happened.
<br><br>They saw that the Yellow Heavenly Beast, which was emitting powerful fluctuations, actually knelt down directly in front of those two people.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The two Wind and Cloud Generals immediately stared in awe, their eyes nearly bursting out.
<br><br>However, it was Huang Tian's next words that made them stare in disbelief.
<br><br>"Huang Tian."
<br><br>"Greetings, Master."
<br><br>Only a humble voice came from Huang Tian as he humbly knelt on the ground.
<br><br>"Just worship me?"
<br><br>"Where does that place my senior sister?"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin frowned slightly and said in a deep voice, "In the future, remember that not only I am your master in the future, all my senior brothers are your masters."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"Huang Tian has met the two masters."
<br><br>Huang Tian knelt on the ground and paid his respects anew without any complaints.
<br><br>Seeing this, Jia Jia Qin then nodded in satisfaction, and with a wave of his palm, the huge yellow sky beast turned into the size of half a zhang.
<br><br>Then followed by the two, into three streams of light and disappeared.
<br><br>Time passed for a long time.
<br><br>The entire barren land has long since returned to calm.
<br><br>A gust of wind blew, the wind and clouds of the two generals just hit a shiver to slow down.
<br><br>The two looked at each other, wide eyed, eyes full of dumbfounded.
<br><br>When.
<br><br>Huang Tian such a supreme beast became so lowly?
<br><br>Actually still kneeling on the ground to call others master?
<br><br>Two people, do not know what to do, let alone know how to report.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>It's a big deal.
<br><br>Things have completely out of their control, towards a completely uncontrollable way to develop.
<br><br>But even if they didn't know how to go back and face it, the two of them knew that they had to report what had happened here to the Genting king as well as to the World of Extinction at the first opportunity.
<br><br>Within the Genting Palace.
<br><br>The World Exterminator as well as the Genting Monarch opened their eyes at the same time, almost pinpointing the time.
<br><br>The moment they opened their eyes, both of them looked at the Qi Yun Immortal Pillar at the same time.
<br><br>Because at this moment the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar has already glowed with a leisurely light, continuously emitting bursts of fluctuations.
<br><br>This is a sign that the Qi Yun Immortal Pillar is about to have a change.
<br><br>Seeing this scene.
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler and the extinction face couldn't help but look happy at the same time.
<br><br>"Looking at the immortal pillar fluctuations, I'm afraid that things have been successfully completed."
<br><br>Exterminator raised the corner of his mouth and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"And looking at the precursor of the immortal pillar fluctuation, this time the change of the immortal pillar is afraid to be not small!"
<br><br>Genting kingdom ruler also looked at each other and smiled.
<br><br>Open the door red.
<br><br>It is simply the opening of the door red.
<br><br>The matter of qi luck, the opening omen is very important.
<br><br>And at this time, outside the palace, two streams of light came from outside the sky.
<br><br>When the king of the world and the cloud-top king looked at them, they noticed that it was the two generals of wind and clouds rushing back.
<br><br>"All of you go with me to greet the two generals of wind and cloud, this great success, the two generals of wind and cloud credit, I want to reward heavily! Genting king waved his hand and said boldly.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>A neat voice came out.
<br><br>The World Exterminator and the King of Genting personally led many experts of the Genting Empire to welcome the two generals of Feng Yun who rushed back outside.
<br><br>"Greetings to the State Monarch and Lord Perisher."
<br><br>Seeing such a big battle, the two generals of Feng Yun who came back were even more panicked in their hearts and hurriedly knelt down on the ground in cold sweat.
<br><br>"Aiya, the two generals have really worked hard, quickly flatten yourself and please rise, today Zheng will reward you heavily."
<br><br>The king of Genting was full of smiles.
<br><br>In the past, such a small general was not worthy of him.
<br><br>But looking at the foreshadowing of the immortal pillar, I am afraid that this time the change will be bigger than they imagined.
<br><br>Even he had already seen the Lord Messenger, carrying the Lord's supreme reward, descending once again.
<br><br>So at this time, he looked at the wind and cloud two generals is to be as smooth as possible.
<br><br>The two generals of Feng Yun heard the words of the ruler of the Genting Kingdom, but panicked chickens were trembling.
<br><br>So the two people hurriedly explained apprehensively, "The king of the country rest in anger, we did not ......"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as they were halfway through their words, they were directly interrupted by the Genting State Monarch.
<br><br>"The two beloved ministers should stop being modest, even though you were only used for observation over there, you still deserve a lot of credit, and I must reward you heavily." The Genting king said in a pleasant manner.
<br><br>These words made the two Wind and Cloud generals even more flustered.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>This is not the case at all.
<br><br>How could they claim the credit for this?
<br><br>Not to anger kill the two of them is already very good, and credit?
<br><br>The two men, who were sweating coldly, hurriedly waved their palms and said in a panic: "The king is not, you misunderstood, really not, things did not ......"
<br><br>However, they just said, once again interrupted by the nearby extermination.
<br><br>"You two do not need to say more."
<br><br>"This is a significant matter, the success is complete, not only the king of the country will reward you heavily, I, the Exterminator, will also reward you heavily." Exterminating the world is equally full of smiles as he transmits his voice.
<br><br>The first time I saw this, I was able to see the whole thing.
<br><br>Looking back on this matter, it was really smooth.
<br><br>It had been a long time since he had been this smooth.
<br><br>Compared to the reward that would come down from the Lord after completing the Immortal Pillar of Qi Luck, what was a small reward for these two little generals?
<br><br>So not only should he be rewarded.
<br><br>But also a heavy reward!
