After settling Zhong Qing, Yi Feng walked out of the martial arts school with a gloomy face.
<br><br>The mastermind behind this matter he knows who it is without thinking, and even a little guess can guess their purpose. It must be the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce who wanted to take his life for profit, but his disciple Zhong Qing helped him to resist.
<br><br>Even though he was only a mortal, it had always been his style to take revenge.
<br><br>Soon, Yi Feng arrived at the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>When the president of the Chamber of Commerce saw that it was Yi Feng who came to the door personally, he didn't dare to be the least bit negligent and put down all the things in his hands and came to receive him personally.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi, please have some tea."
<br><br>Yin Xiong stretched his hand and said nervously.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not move.
<br><br>This could not help but make Yin Xiong's heart apprehensive to the extreme, sitting like an acupuncture needle by the side to accompany Yi Feng, frantically recalling whether he had upset Yi Feng in any way.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng since the door, then gloomy face, from the beginning to the end did not say a word. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Finally, when Yin Xiong could not bear this pressure, Yi Feng, who was always silent, finally raised his head and looked at Yin Xiong and said, "President Yin."
<br><br>"In, in in, Mr. Yi I am."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng finally speak, Yin Xiong gave a jolt and hurriedly answered.
<br><br>"Your Chamber of Commerce should be able to kill people, right?" Yi Feng said again.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>However Yin Xiong didn't react for a moment.
<br><br>"I mean, I want to kill a few people." Yi Feng finally served that being tea, remembered his precious apprentice's injury, narrowed his eyes and said, "Because, someone almost killed my apprentice."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Someone dared to kill your disciple, Mr. Yi?"
<br><br>Yin Xiong stood up sharply, his eyes wide.
<br><br>This matter sounded a little too appalling to him, what kind of person Yi Feng was, although he didn't know it clearly, he also knew it in his heart.
<br><br>However, someone has made a move against his disciple?
<br><br>This matter, can be big but small ah!
<br><br>Once not handled properly, let this one angry, I'm afraid the whole Pingjiang City have to change the sky ah!
<br><br>"So, is there a way?" Yi Feng looked up and asked, "Of course, what kind of payment is needed, you can mention it."
<br><br>"There is a way, there is a way, of course there is a way." Yin Xiong almost shivered out the words, directly ignoring what Yi Feng said about the reward.
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and said, "Then I want to see the head of the main messenger, is that okay?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, I, Yin Xiong, am here to guarantee it." Yin Xiong hastily patted his chest and said.
<br><br>"But, there is a possibility that it is someone from the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce." Yi Feng added: "Of course, there is no evidence for the time being, you need to check it out."
<br><br>"Sir you do not worry, exactly how I will find out as soon as possible, no matter who it is, and then put the head of the mastermind behind the curtain in front of you." Yin Xiong put up his palm and said solemnly.
<br><br>"Good, I'll trouble you."
<br><br>Yi Feng drank his tea cleanly and got up to leave.
<br><br>Originally, he had only guessed that the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce might have this kind of killer hook, and hadn't reported much hope, but now it seemed to be an unexpected pleasure.
<br><br>After sending Yi Feng away, Yin Xiong did not dare to stay for a moment, and directly took two of his men and drove his horse towards the Castle Peak Gate.
<br><br>With a fast horse, Yin Xiong found Luo Lanxue.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's face turned white as soon as she heard the events before and after, she also immediately understood the seriousness of the matter and quickly said, "Uncle, I'll take you to see the master now, you tell my master the whole story before and after."
<br><br>"Yes, yes."
<br><br>Yin Xiong nodded his head, but his heart was also nervous, he had long heard about the Castle Peak Ancestor, but this was his first time to see it.
<br><br>"Master, there is an important matter to see."
<br><br>Outside the secret room, Luo Lanxue led Yin Xiong to shout respectfully.
<br><br>"Disciple, my master has recently used Mr. Treasure Sword to gain some insight, no matter what it is, you can go back first!" Within the secret room, came the majestic voice of the old ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>"Master, it is a very significant matter." Luo Lanxue said anxiously.
<br><br>"I said, no matter what the important matter is, it must not disturb my seclusion." Old Ancestor Qing Shan's voice carried a hint of sulking, "If you interrupt my enlightenment, you can't afford the responsibility."
<br><br>"Please restrain your anger, Master, this matter, I'm afraid, is more significant than your enlightenment." Luo Lanxue clenched her red lips and said directly, "Sir's disciple, Duke Zhong Qing, was almost killed."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Just as Luo Lanxue's words fell, an unbelievable voice came out from inside, followed by a "boom" sound, and the Old Man of Green Mountain directly burst out.
<br><br>After that, the sinewy Old Ancestor Qingshan grabbed Luo Lanxue's jade palm and asked with glaring eyes, "What did you just say?"
