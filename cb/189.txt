The pressure coming from the four martial superiors made two people tremble and shiver, crying their hearts out.
<br><br>"Four seniors, don't get excited don't get excited, we won't run, don't worry don't worry." Guan Yunpeng hastened to show a flattering smile, and hurriedly placated the four people, afraid that the four people would become angry and blast over towards them.
<br><br>Just like that, under the four people's cold sweat, Zhong Qing had walked back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Master!"
<br><br>"What's wrong?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"It's that Guan Yunpeng yesterday, he fought with someone next to our martial arts school again, and not only that, he broke two of our tiles!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned slightly.
<br><br>I thought Guan Yunpeng was not a bad person, but I didn't expect it to be a thorn in the side, actually repeatedly fighting in front of his martial arts school.
<br><br>Instantly, Yi Feng's ill feeling towards Guan Yunpeng as a person increased greatly.
<br><br>"Go, disciple, tell them to get lost, as far away as possible." Yi Feng ironically shouted, "By the way, Laozi's tile, tell them to compensate, no need to give face." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Yes, I understand master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing walked towards the outside with a sullen face.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Master was already angry.
<br><br>When the two Guan Yunpeng, who were being watched by the four Martial Dignitaries, saw Zhong Qing walking with a cold face, their hearts thudded and they immediately understood that something big was wrong.
<br><br>"My master is very angry about this matter." Zhong Qing said with a sullen little face.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The two people's hearts sank.
<br><br>"Also, master told you to compensate for the tiles." Zhong Qing said again.
<br><br>"How to compensate?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng wiped his sweat and asked busily.
<br><br>"You say how to compensate?" Zhong Qing asked rhetorically.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was immediately confused.
<br><br>After taking a look at the two broken tiles, in terms of value, they were only two gold coins of mortals.
<br><br>But today, it is clear that this is not just two tiles so simple ah!
<br><br>When I thought of this, Guan Yunpeng clenched his teeth, lowered his head and offered the long sword in his hand.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>For a sword cultivator, I'm afraid that the most valuable thing is the sword in his hand.
<br><br>Seeing this, Shaking Heavenly Que also offered the longsword in his hand with a shriveled face.
<br><br>"What do I need this broken sword of yours for?" However, Zhong Qing said disdainfully, "For swords of your level, we have a whole bunch of them in our backyard!"
<br><br>Uh ......
<br><br>As soon as they heard the words, the two of them were in a dilemma.
<br><br>Yeah.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and the few of them who farmed were all holy products, how could they look at such long swords?
<br><br>What to do?
<br><br>They did not have anything more valuable than this sword on them for the time being.
<br><br>Looking at Zhong Qing's increasingly impatient look, Guan Yunpeng hurriedly said again, "Don't be angry, give us a month's time, we will definitely compensate."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, give us a month's time, we will definitely compensate." Shaking Heavenly Que also hurriedly responded.
<br><br>"One month?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing frowned.
<br><br>Just two tiles, still need a month?
<br><br>These two people were dressed like dogs, but they were so poor?
<br><br>Seeing that Zhong Qing did not say anything, the two people shivered and their hands and feet became nowhere.
<br><br>"Okay, I believe you once, but if you lie, don't let me see you in the future." Zhong Qing hesitated for a moment before he let loose his harsh words.
<br><br>"Dare not dare."
<br><br>The two men hastily agreed.
<br><br>"Go, go, go!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing impatiently waved his hand.
<br><br>Seeing this, Guan Yunpeng and Shake Heavenly Que revealed a look of relief and hurriedly left.
<br><br>It was a long time after they were far away from the martial hall before the two breathed heavily.
<br><br>"Luckily, it's okay." Shake Tian Que said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>However, as soon as his voice fell, Guan Yunpeng looked over with a hateful gaze.
<br><br>"Luckily it's okay?"
<br><br>"You can still say so fucking lightly, Laozi had a hard time getting on with that one, but you destroyed it with a sword and still owe a debt, and you say it's fine?"
<br><br>"This, I didn't mean to do it either." Shake the sky Que cold sweat, quickly waved his hand to comfort: "You calm calm ......!"
<br><br>"Calm you paralyzed!"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's hand sword light flashed and slashed towards Shaking Heavenly Que.
<br><br>"Calm down, calm down, calm down, ah ......"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que swept into the air and ran, Guan Yunpeng followed him, accompanied by the sound of cursing, disappeared into two streams of light.
<br><br>After the two people left, Yi Feng reported the matter to Yi Feng, and then got two spare tiles to replace them.
<br><br>Yi Feng also did not care about this matter, while drinking morning tea, while counting his money jar.
<br><br>From some time ago, he hid the money jar under the bed from time to time a little less, thought into the thieves he will change the money jar, which allows the money jar did not burn money again.
<br><br>A sigh of relief, just to lie down in the recliner, but found a cursing voice from outside the door.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked out to take a look, but found that it was a few ladies from Yi Hong Yuan.
<br><br>"Why is it you guys, why, come to find me to fight the landlord?" Yi Feng asked with a smile.
<br><br>"What landlord fight, Yi Feng I ask you, is there a skeleton Ben Wei in your martial arts school?" A young lady in the lead stuck her water snake waist and pointed at Yi Feng and asked.
<br><br>"Skeleton Ben Wei?" Yi Feng blinked his eyes and asked in bewilderment, "What Bone Ben Wei, are you mistaken?"
<br><br>"It's Bone Ben Wei, there's absolutely no mistake."
<br><br>"Yes, he said his surname is Bone, because he did something very majestic, so it is called Bone Ben Wei, we definitely will not remember wrong."
<br><br>"Yes, we all know him when he turns into dust."
<br><br>At one time, the crowd chattered and said they were about to rush into the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly stopped them and said with a helpless face, "Ladies, don't be impulsive, okay, what is going on, let's talk clearly first, okay?"
<br><br>"Okay, then I'll tell you clearly."
<br><br>The leader of the ladies said with a face full of anger: "That skeleton Ben Wei in our Yee Hong Institute for many days to eat and drink for nothing without paying, said that it is your martial arts school people, let us seven days later to ask him for, for your sake, we believe him, but did not think that seven days time is up, but he disappeared."
<br><br>"That is, at the beginning of the offer is quite generous, but did not expect to be such a person, but also time after time to order seven or eight, really disgusting, no money, do not pretend that broad."
<br><br>"Humph, want to white whoring, no way!"
<br><br>"You say we do a little business is easy, there are still white whoring these days, I tell you, Yi Feng you do not stop, hurry up and let him out to pay."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, hurry up and let him come out to pay."
<br><br>A group of people said, and excited, words full of hatred for that skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>Yi Feng Wu black face desperately explained: "Ladies, although I feel sympathy for your encounter, but our martial arts school really does not have Bone Ben Wei ah!"
<br><br>"Impossible, he said it was you the martial arts school."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, you must have hidden it for him."
<br><br>"Really no ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng explained in a serious tone.
<br><br>However, just as his voice fell, a black shadow behind him, a slip of smoke and burrowed out, trying to run away.
