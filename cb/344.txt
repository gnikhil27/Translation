"That's still true?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an was instantly displeased.
<br><br>Using his cultivation power, he observed Yi Feng from afar.
<br><br>"Yo?"
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>He stood up and was ready to make a move to teach this turtledove mortal a lesson.
<br><br>But just as he got up, he stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>He couldn't help but rub his chin and pondered.
<br><br>"No, no, no, still no."
<br><br>"Although this is a mortal, battle power is not much threat to me, but also will be tainted with karma ah!"
<br><br>"In case, this guy has a bully son, 10,000 years later run to me to avenge the murder of my father?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Or, after this guy died, he was crossed over by people from other worlds, woke up and came to me with the phrase thirty years after the river?"
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>He revealed a look of fear afterwards.
<br><br>"What a blessing!"
<br><br>"Fortunately, I didn't make a move."
<br><br>He was secretly glad that he didn't make a move, otherwise he would have almost gotten into trouble with killing himself again.
<br><br>"In that case, I won't do it directly, I'll secretly lead this mortal to that fellow who is sealed on the island, I believe that fellow will take care of this turtledove mortal."
<br><br>"Although it will also be tainted with karma, but at least it will not be so dangerous."
<br><br>"But mortal you can't blame me, who wants you to occupy my nest!"
<br><br>Thinking of this, he made some noise and wanted to attract Yi Feng to go over.
<br><br>And Yi Feng, who heard the sound, was really attracted.
<br><br>After all, in Yi Feng's view, this island in the future is his home base, the island inside what animals, or what dangerous things have to find out.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Yi Feng followed carefully.
<br><br>"This mortal has really fallen for it."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an gloated.
<br><br>Time passed slowly, Wu Chang'an had already attracted Yi Feng through half of the island and finally was at his destination.
<br><br>"Great success!"
<br><br>"If that guy knows I brought such a good ration to him, he who has been sealed away from the island, will definitely be very grateful to me!"
<br><br>"Maybe, also with this guy further good relations, will be able to eliminate his to my billionth of the security risks also."
<br><br>"It's really two birds with one stone!"
<br><br>Wu Changan's face was happy.
<br><br>Then with a deep sweep towards the cliff, he flew away.
<br><br>At the cliff, a black bear shrank in the corner of the cliff, shivering violently.
<br><br>"Ka ka ka ka ......"
<br><br>Even his teeth, can not help but click, emitting a burst of stuttering sounds.
<br><br>"God, what kind of sins am I making, some time ago came a bull, made me afraid to leave the door for a long time, this is just, that bull at least can still contact."
<br><br>"But God damn it, here comes another super pervert."
<br><br>"This pervert, simply unbelievable."
<br><br>"Just a glance at him at the lake, I turned into the origin state, cultivation can not be exerted half a point."
<br><br>"Why in the world there is such a terrible person, and also let me encounter, I am just a small bear sealed in the island, human and animal harmless ah oooh!"
<br><br>"Fortunately in is, I hide here and do not go out, he should not find me!"
<br><br>He stuttered, secretly relieved.
<br><br>Just then, Wu Chang'an swept in and landed beside him, patting his shoulder.
<br><br>The black bear shivered and looked back to see that it was Wu Chang'an, and immediately breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Although this bull also scared him half a month to go out, but this bull at least okay to talk, and did not want to make a move on him.
<br><br>"You, why are you here?"
<br><br>Black Bear couldn't help but ask nervously.
<br><br>"Man, no need to be nervous, long ago said we live together peacefully, you do not make a move on me, I do not make a move on you, you are afraid that I am not sincere, this is not, today I brought you sincere, brought you a big ration!"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an said with a smile, and with that he pointed toward the black bear in the distance.
<br><br>"Look, I led you here, this ration is good, right, white and clean."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The black bear looked his gaze toward the distance.
<br><br>Then he saw that a white-robed figure was probing towards this side.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>"My dear mother."
<br><br>"I can't avoid him, why are you leading me over?"
<br><br>The black bear immediately drew a breath of cold air, almost directly broke down and cried.
<br><br>When he chased away another human in the morning, he unintentionally bumped into this white-robed man.
<br><br>That self-contained suppression effect almost made him piss in fear.
<br><br>The whole morning are shrunken here, not dare to venture a head, breath are pressed to the bottom, is afraid to encounter this human again.
<br><br>But who knows, this Wu Changan directly led him over.
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"Woo ......"
<br><br>"Humans are really not good, I'm not finished with you."
<br><br>The black bear angrily pointed at Wu Chang'an, wanting to make a move and seemingly unable to fight, had to viciously put down a vicious sentence, holding his head and fled.
<br><br>Looking at the fleeing black bear, Wu Chang'an directly confused in place.
<br><br>But soon, he comprehended what.
<br><br>A cold air rose up in his body.
<br><br>The appearance of this human actually scared the black bear away, so doesn't that mean ......
<br><br>this human was strong!
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"If this human knows everything I've done secretly, wouldn't that ......"
<br><br>"Careless, hasty, made a feud, broke into a big trouble ah!"
<br><br>"What to do, what to do?"
<br><br>Wu Changan anxious forehead sweat dripping.
<br><br>Then with a grit of his teeth, he coldly muttered, "Why don't we just do one thing or the other and finish this human personally?"
<br><br>This seemed to be the best way for him.
<br><br>And walking here Yi Feng opened his head and looked around, remembered something, took the Ring of Space out and twisted it.
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>Four large beasts were released by Yi Feng.
<br><br>The reason why it has been placed in the ring of space, is that these beasts are really no place to bolt, tethered to the martial arts school he was afraid of scaring people.
<br><br>"Let you guys out for a while to get some air!" Yi Feng murmured.
<br><br>The four beasts looked up at him fiercely, full of hatred.
<br><br>But Yi Feng pressed them not to give a damn, continued to open his eyes to observe the island around.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Wu Changan, who was just about to make a move against Yi Feng, suddenly shivered and his body burrowed into the earth, leaving just a head bubbling outside.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"These four beasts, three of them have a one percent threat to my life, and one has a one percent threat to my life."
<br><br>"And being able to control these four beasts means that this person is also a 100 percent threat to my death."
<br><br>"Big brother, it's actually a super big brother!"
<br><br>Wu Changan had a deathly pale face, this death threat, he just couldn't accept it at all!
<br><br>Didn't expect to get into such big trouble in a moment of carelessness.
<br><br>Saying that, he folded his hands and prayed.
<br><br>"Big Brother, I didn't mean to mess with you, much less attract you to be a black bear's ration, I was wrong, I was wrong, you mustn't find trouble with me!"
<br><br>While praying, he was also looking for some fluke in his heart.
<br><br>It is to hope that this big brother, does not know what he is doing behind the scenes, so that will not find him trouble.
<br><br>And at this time, Yi Feng, who was looking around openly, opened his mouth and passed out a voice.
<br><br>"Little thing, actually hiding with me, it does not matter, slowly play, after all, in this island, you can not escape my palm."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly, also do not know what small animal, he chased so long, chased here actually disappeared.
<br><br>But it doesn't matter.
<br><br>Since it's on this island, it's natural to know what kind of animal it is after a long time.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Hearing this, Wu Changan's heart was stuck in his throat.
<br><br>Mental defenses are almost collapsed.
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>Wasn't that what was said to him?
<br><br>It turned out that this person had long known about his existence, and even knew all the movements behind his back.
<br><br>The reason why he did not make a move on him, is not in a hurry, want to slowly play him?
<br><br>"No, no, use your brain, you must use your brain, use your brain how to escape this crisis ......"
<br><br>"Wu Chang'an, you are not a normal cultivator, you have the thinking that everyone in this world does not have, you must be able to lift the crisis."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an rubbed his head, desperately thinking.
<br><br>And in the distance, Yi Feng looked at the lake in the distance and seemed to remember something.
<br><br>In his previous life, there was also such a lake in his hometown, and as a child, he would always swim in the lake with his buddies, and then go home to be spanked by his parents.
<br><br>And after crossing over, he had thought he would do something big, even cultivate to the top and use his cultivation to return to the original world.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>After so long but still bumbling.
<br><br>"Alas, a travellers is really a failure!"
<br><br>"Before, I was meticulous in Pingjiang City, and now that I'm on this island, I still have to be meticulous."
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh at himself.
<br><br>He found such a remote island to build a clan, in fact, is not also want to avoid the trouble that can not be solved.
<br><br>I just hope, to complete the task, the system can give some strength, let him fly to the sky!
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Wu Changan in the dark heard Yi Feng's words and was scared out of his mind.
<br><br>This kind of fright.
<br><br>It was even more excessive than facing imminent death.
<br><br>This white-robed man ......
<br><br>had actually directly told the biggest secret in his heart!
<br><br>And even directly mocked him.
<br><br>Because.
<br><br>The one he was talking about, the travellers who had met from Pingjiang City to this island, wasn't he the one?
