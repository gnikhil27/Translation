That was, more like, directly to him, ah.
<br><br>It was.
<br><br>It must have been.
<br><br>He must have found out about his presence a long time ago.
<br><br>The fart before.
<br><br>And then the piss.
<br><br>And now the words.
<br><br>Obviously all prove that he has long known his existence, and the purpose of his visit is also expressed directly, it turns out to be for the Hunting Heaven Tablet.
<br><br>But you big.
<br><br>You want the Hunting Tablet, you say it, I give you not finished, and I have to torture me to death before I say it slowly?
<br><br>In the cry, the shadow palm a wave. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>At once, that floating in the sky above the hall, has not moved the black stone monument all over a gentle tremor.
<br><br>It then smashed down and fell to the ground.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly turned his head and looked at the black moving brick on the ground with a slight shock.
<br><br>Never thought that luck was so good that a slab really fell from the roof.
<br><br>Walk over to pick it up.
<br><br>You do not say.
<br><br>It's quite a handful.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Yi Feng weighed it in his hand and nodded with satisfaction, after all, for self-defense, it is better than nothing.
<br><br>Seeing that Yi Feng seemed satisfied, the shadow breathed a sigh of relief inside the corner.
<br><br>The Hunting Heaven Tablet is valuable, but not as valuable as his life.
<br><br>Although he was already in a state of death, but the more this situation, the more he cherished this last lingering.
<br><br>Looking at the countless passages linking the hall, Yi Feng casually found one and went in.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng finally leave, the cowering shadow in the corner finally felt relieved, his face was filled with a look of life after the robbery.
<br><br>"Damn, which ghost made this ghost place!"
<br><br>Walking in the winding and rugged passage, Yi Feng cursed with an ugly face, after walking for most of the day he didn't know where to go.
<br><br>"Bang Bang."
<br><br>Just then, he clearly heard the sound of weapons clashing in front of him.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up, and quickly slipped towards the place where the sound came from.
<br><br>Then he saw that in the passage in front of him, there were two figures fighting.
<br><br>After a collision, the two looked at each other, eyeing each other.
<br><br>The two people fighting against each other were a man and a woman.
<br><br>The woman's face was stunningly beautiful, her figure was tall, and she was holding a three-foot long blade.
<br><br>It was Yun Yaoyao.
<br><br>However, at this moment, her face was grave, and the corners of her mouth were still spilled with traces of blood, obviously wounded.
<br><br>The other is a middle-aged man, wearing a gray suit.
<br><br>He had a gutter nose and was holding two claws, a sinister person at first glance.
<br><br>"Yun Yaoyao."
<br><br>"If it were outside, I'm afraid it wouldn't be easy to beat you, but now that we both have no cultivation, we are fighting with our physical bodies, there is no way you, a woman, can be my opponent." The hawk-nosed man said coldly, "I advise you to quickly tie your hands and capture."
<br><br>Yun Xiaoyao's face was filled with despair, but in the face of the hawk-nosed threat, she still didn't give in, instead, she gripped the long sword in her hand a little tighter and coldly said, "Old Devil Yan, don't say those useless things, if you want to make a move, hurry up!"
<br><br>"It seems that you really don't want to eat the forfeit wine, you're still talking tough at this point." Old Devil Yan said coldly: "You should know that there will be no one alive in this kind of place, no one can save you."
<br><br>"You're not human."
<br><br>"I'm not human?"
<br><br>However, just as his voice fell, a cursing sound came from behind him, while a cold kick suddenly landed on his back.
<br><br>The sudden attack caused Old Devil Yan to stagger.
<br><br>His face changed and he hurriedly turned around to look, and instantly found a youth standing behind him with a slate in his hand.
<br><br>The desperate Yun Yaoyao likewise did not expect that there would be someone to save her at such a desperate time.
<br><br>She also hurriedly will be amazed gaze, looked over.
<br><br>This look immediately made her body tremble.
<br><br>This familiar figure ......
<br><br>But isn't it the same mortal that she spent time with before.
<br><br>She was still worried about Yi Feng's life and death before, but she never thought that Yi Feng was actually still alive and unharmed.
<br><br>"It's great that you're okay!"
<br><br>She shouted in surprise.
<br><br>"You guys originally knew each other?"
<br><br>And when Old Devil Yan heard Yun Yoyo's voice, he immediately stared at Yi Feng and drank with a gloomy face, "Kid, even if you know each other, but I have to warn you, don't interfere in our affairs, or I'll let you die without a burial place."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao changed slightly.
<br><br>Also hurriedly made a wink towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Obviously, it was a sign for Yi Feng to leave.
<br><br>Because in her opinion, Old Devil Yan was simply not an existence that Yi Feng, a mortal, could afford to mess with.
<br><br>Since Yi Feng was able to get his life back, she didn't want him to risk his life again because of it.
<br><br>However, what both of them did not expect was that Yi Feng said very forcefully, "Then I'm not going to leave, I'm going to manage."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made both of them unbelievable.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao had a worried face, she never thought that this mortal would be so bold as to provoke Old Devil Yan.
<br><br>In the eyes of Old Devil Yan, there was also a strong killing intent.
<br><br>Never thought that this brat would defy his threat.
<br><br>"Kid, go to hell!"
<br><br>The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, the longer the claw in his hand moved, and he enveloped towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Be careful."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao shouted.
<br><br>But just as her voice fell, Yi Feng lightly dodged Old Devil Yan's attack and struck Old Devil Yan's head with a slab.
<br><br>Without the cultivation protection, Old Devil Yan's head immediately broke and blood flowed, and his eyes were sparking, staggering in place.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>This scene directly made Yun Yaoyao cover her red lips, staring at the beautiful eyes filled with disbelief.
<br><br>This mortal.
<br><br>It was too fierce.
<br><br>He actually knocked Old Devil Yan's head with a brick?
<br><br>How did he do that?
<br><br>You should know that even if they have no cultivation, but years of combat experience is still there, body strength is also absolutely no one to compare with.
<br><br>But Old Devil Yan was a mortal knocked a brick, this is too incredible.
<br><br>The Old Devil Yan, who was holding his head, did not expect to receive such a blow and shouted in anger, "Little bastard, do you know who I am, I am the Midcontinent Split Claw Old Devil Yan, how dare you hurt me, don't you want to live?"
<br><br>"Bully chatter!"
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that Yi Feng spat out impatiently and knocked another slab on his head.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Let the next Yun Yoyo eyes jumped.
<br><br>He rushed over and hurriedly said, "You're in big trouble, this person is a Martial Emperor cultivator, and he comes from the Central Continent, the power behind him is powerful, if you hurt him like this, he won't let you go, I'm afraid I'll have trouble saving you then."
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the staggering Yan old devil, and added a brick to dry him to the ground after, then slowly and leisurely added: "In this what you said under the descending dimensional suppression, cultivator not cultivator, what is the difference, still a weak chicken?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was directly stunned in place.
<br><br>But always feel Yi Feng a mortal will be a martial emperor beaten like this is really inappropriate, so again hurriedly said: "here are indeed no cultivation, but out of it, you are not afraid of his revenge?"
<br><br>"Then shoot him to death."
<br><br>Yi Feng weighed the moving brick in his hand and said.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was stunned at once.
<br><br>Faced with Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>She actually had no words to say.
<br><br>But she had to admit, this is true in.
<br><br>But from the mouth of a mortal to hear such words, she always felt a little unreal.
<br><br>But what she did not expect was that Yi Feng directly put into action.
<br><br>He snatched the long sword from her hand and stabbed it into Old Devil Yan's chest.
<br><br>Clean and sharp.
<br><br>Not the slightest delay.
<br><br>Looking at the old devil Yan who lost his breath, this made Yun Yoyao a long time to slow down.
<br><br>Yi Feng, this mortal ......
<br><br>The fact that in front of her, he really killed a Martial Emperor?
<br><br>If this were to be told, I'm afraid it would set off a sensation throughout the continent.
<br><br>And I'm afraid that Old Devil Yan would never have imagined in his life that he would actually be planted in the hands of a mortal after so much effort to cultivate to Martial Emperor.
<br><br>"What are you still standing there, collecting the spoils of war?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave her a white glance and said.
<br><br>Hearing this, Yun Yoyao then reacted and stripped off Old Devil Yan's storage ring.
<br><br>Once it was opened, there was a wide variety of treasures inside, and even with Yun Yaoyao's state of mind, she was surprised.
<br><br>"Well, this person was killed by me after all, reasonably speaking these things should go to me."
<br><br>"But this cultivator's stuff, I can't use it either, so ......"
<br><br>Rubbing his nose, Yi Feng took out a pen and paper again.
<br><br>"How about another IOU?"
<br><br>"Uh?"
<br><br>"The stuff is yours, and you give me another million, okay?"
<br><br>"I, this, one million gold coins?"
<br><br>"Are your cultivators' things that worthless?"
<br><br>"No, I mean ......"
<br><br>"Okay then, let's make it one million."
<br><br>Yi Feng cleanly wrote the IOU, pulled up Yun Yaoyao, who was still in a daze, and pressed her palm on the IOU, before he put it away with satisfaction.
<br><br>"Remember, owe me two million now."
