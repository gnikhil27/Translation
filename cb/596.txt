Just when the five people were ready and had the arrow on the string, Yi Feng suddenly spoke again.
<br><br>"Wait, I have a request!"
<br><br>"What again?" One of the men in blue opened his mouth impatiently, "Why are you talking so much nonsense!"
<br><br>"You five surround me, it's not fair to win the fight." Yi Feng said, "You are all Earth Immortals, isn't it easy to beat me. Stand together."
<br><br>Yi Feng pointed to a position, "All stand there." That position was exactly the direction Guo Shijie was standing.
<br><br>"You!"
<br><br>"That's all I ask, you guys stand over there."
<br><br>The five people were already extremely impatient.
<br><br>But five against one is indeed also not honorable, anyway, Yi Feng is also a sure death situation, it is not a big deal.
<br><br>So with a stern face, they walked towards the position that Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Yi Feng narrowed his eyes and looked at the five people. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>He is also afraid of ah, attacked from all sides, he will not be able to point over how to do.
<br><br>Now a direction is much better ah!
<br><br>Both sides, tightly confronted.
<br><br>The atmosphere was frozen to the extreme.
<br><br>Sun and Moon Peak's disciples had a face of hatred and could not wait to see Yi Feng being trampled to death in front of their eyes.
<br><br>While the disciples of Star Peak were all on tenterhooks, full of worry, even Liu Yan was tugging her jade hand tightly.
<br><br>"Begin!"
<br><br>Finally, the old man in charge of the Life and Death Stage, slowly spat out his mouth.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Guo Shijie stood up straight and looked at Yi Feng with a face full of expectation.
<br><br>He wanted to see clearly, point by point, how Yi Feng, was going to die.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just then, the change happened.
<br><br>It was to see that the five people with killing intent had just raised their steps, and five air-breaking sounds came out.
<br><br>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"
<br><br>Five sharp qi energy pierced out from Yi Feng's finger, locked the five people in the blink of an eye, and then pierced through the five people's bodies with a devastating force.
<br><br>The five people's eyes stared straight up.
<br><br>This is ......
<br><br>They have not even touched Yi Feng yet, it?
<br><br>But they could never figure it out ......
<br><br>Five clumps of flesh and blood immediately exploded in the sky, the smell of blood puffed out and filled the whole life and death stage.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>The exploding flesh and blood blew up Guo Shijie face.
<br><br>Also exploded a bunch of Sun Moon Peak disciples' faces behind him.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>The large square became silent.
<br><br>Needle drop can be heard.
<br><br>Everyone was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Even Liu Yan was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Blood also splashed onto her body. Only because Guo Shijie was in front of her, so only the hem of her skirt splashed a little.
<br><br>But it still did not affect her stunned in place.
<br><br>Five Earth Immortal Perfection ......
<br><br>Can be instantly killed by a Human Immortal in seconds?
<br><br>Impossible.
<br><br>Absolutely impossible!
<br><br>Even if the One Thought Finger was cultivated to perfection, it was still impossible.
<br><br>After a short period of silence, there was a boisterous cheer that erupted from the crowd of Star Peak.
<br><br>"Bull Bastard."
<br><br>"Good kill!"
<br><br>"My senior brother Yi Feng bull batch."
<br><br>"All stand up and shout Yi Feng bull batch."
<br><br>"Yi Feng bull batch, Yi Feng bull batch ......"
<br><br>The cheers of the Star Peak disciples grew louder and louder, and only then did they understand why Yi Feng was standing on the stage without the slightest fear.
<br><br>And also dare to speak out.
<br><br>It turns out that it's not his mouth that is wild, but really has the strength ah.
<br><br>Don't mention how excited they are now.
<br><br>Their new junior brother, instantly took out five Earth Immortals, simply no one has ever done that before!
<br><br>And the elders of Star Peak were no better than that group of disciples.
<br><br>"Hiding clumsiness, haha, hiding clumsiness, this kid is hiding clumsiness, he is not a human immortal at all."
<br><br>"Yes, this kid is fucking hiding deep, now it seems that he is at least an Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"Good, otherwise the human immortal strength, can not kill five people with a single thought finger seconds, only the earth immortal can do."
<br><br>"This patience, this heart, simply ah!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha, cool cool cool!"
<br><br>One by one, the elders pinched each other's noses and stroked their beards out in excitement.
<br><br>"This kid ......"
<br><br>"It's really surprising."
<br><br>Liu Yan also breathed a sigh of relief, beautiful eyes leisurely surveyed on the stage shouting "low profile" Yi Feng, the corners of the mouth could not help but raise.
<br><br>But this cheer in the Sun Moon Peak crowd, is so ear-splitting.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not kill, but also planted five people.
<br><br>This made Guo Shijie's face cloudy, wiped off the broken flesh on his face and smelled it, then absolute killing intent surged out.
<br><br>"Little bastard, you actually hide your clumsiness, concealed report strength, killed five of my Sun Moon Peak disciples, I kill you."
<br><br>After saying that, he surged up violently and directly rushed up to the Life and Death Stage.
<br><br>"Guo Shijie what are you doing?"
<br><br>Liu Yan shouted explosively and was about to step forward.
<br><br>But she had just moved, the old man sitting next to the life and death stage dozing eyes flashed a golden light, directly waved out a palm.
<br><br>This palm waved out, the storm swept Guo Shijie immediately flew backwards, hitting the ground heavily.
<br><br>"When the old man, posing to see?"
<br><br>The old man said sleepily.
<br><br>"Elder, don't dare."
<br><br>Guo Shijie smiled and hurriedly stood up and bowed.
<br><br>"If you want to break the rules of the Life and Death Stage in front of the old man, first weigh if you have that qualification." The old man's eerie voice came out, followed by a heavy drink, "Get out!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie's body shook as he heard the words.
<br><br>Not daring to say another word, he hurriedly fled with his disciples.
<br><br>Seeing this, the disciples of Star Peak once again erupted into fierce cheers.
<br><br>Relief.
<br><br>It's really too relieved.
<br><br>Especially Guo Shijie wretchedly fled that look, simply a thief happy.
<br><br>Liu Yan also overflowed with a strong smile.
<br><br>After bowing towards the old man of the Life and Death Stage, he ordered the disciples to go back to their homes.
<br><br>"Yes, back to the peak!"
<br><br>The crowd of disciples answered.
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>The crowd rushed up to the Life and Death Platform and lifted Yi Feng up, interspersed with a Star Peak elder.
<br><br>"Aiya, old Fang, let the disciples do it, you're an elder, what are you doing, how unstable?" A nearby elder reminded.
<br><br>"Aiya, too long suppressed led to too excited today, forgetting the identity, rashly rash."
<br><br>That elder stroked his beard and retreated with a smile.
<br><br>A group of people, accompanied by a warm atmosphere, in a triumphant manner, which hit the road back home.
