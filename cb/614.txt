Seeing the situation.
<br><br>Wu Fan's eyes were wide and filled with horror.
<br><br>He never thought that this person actually separated by tens of millions of miles and directly tore through space to chase him.
<br><br>But he didn't just sit there and wait for death.
<br><br>With a bite of his teeth, another talisman was taken out by him and floated into the sky, turning into stars that directly collapsed and dispersed.
<br><br>"Wu Fan is in trouble, I would like to use this only opportunity to implore allies to give a hand!"
<br><br>As soon as this voice of his came out.
<br><br>In the vast Heaven's Immortal Hall, countless auras that were not weaker than Wu Fan's awakened violently at this moment.
<br><br>Feeling these strands of breath, Wu Fan's face relaxed a lot.
<br><br>At least do not die alone.
<br><br>But suddenly. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The white palm in the sky, flipped his hand and slapped down towards the void.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>This sound.
<br><br>Not a certain range of trembling.
<br><br>Rather, it was the trembling of the entire heaven and earth.
<br><br>The heavens and the earth changed color.
<br><br>The entire Heaven's Immortal Hall was directly lost by a quarter under this slap.
<br><br>This quarter of the range, directly turned into nothingness.
<br><br>This palm made those auras that had just risen, directly sink into silence.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Not to mention the movement.
<br><br>Those people did not even dare to breathe.
<br><br>Wu Fan's legs went weak and he sat on his butt, staring at his eyes, cold sweat.
<br><br>This kind of power.
<br><br>This kind of power.
<br><br>What kind of person is this?
<br><br>In the spatial rift.
<br><br>The black-robed man walked out quietly, looking at the father and son without fluctuation.
<br><br>Finger bones gently raised.
<br><br>Mysterious power wrapped around Wu Sign.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"So painful!"
<br><br>"Father, save me, save me!"
<br><br>Wu Sign was suffering from severe pain, all the tortures in the world were being performed on him in turn at this moment.
<br><br>Looking at this miserable state of his only son.
<br><br>Wu Fan's lips were already bitten, and his eyes were filled with hatred and unwillingness.
<br><br>But what could he do?
<br><br>In this absolute strength, he can only watch.
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>He jerked his head up.
<br><br>It was discovered that within the boundaries of the Heaven's Immortal Hall, the sky was windy and clouds rolled in all directions.
<br><br>At the same time, a golden light appeared in the sky.
<br><br>It was like the light of Buddha shining throughout the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>And under this Buddha's light shining, the entire Heaven's Immortal Hall could not help but kneel down.
<br><br>"Heavenly Dao!"
<br><br>"This is the Heavenly Dao!"
<br><br>Prostrating on the ground, Wu Fan emitted a trembling voice.
<br><br>"Yes, the existence of the Heaven's Immortal Hall is to fulfill the order of this world for the Heavenly Dao, equivalent to the Heaven's Immortal Hall is the projection of the Heavenly Dao, this person has destroyed the Heaven's Immortal Hall four-one, which is equal to violating the will of the Heavenly Dao."
<br><br>Wu Fan's body trembled violently.
<br><br>Staring with deadly anticipation.
<br><br>This person.
<br><br>It was bound to be subdued by the Heavenly Dao.
<br><br>Yes, yes, yes.
<br><br>Will definitely be the heavenly dao to suppress and kill.
<br><br>Even if you are strong, do you still dare to oppose the sky?
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>As he wished.
<br><br>The golden light appeared, there are terrifying laws condensed, locked Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>The power of the Heavenly Dao.
<br><br>Even a trace of it.
<br><br>Ordinary people do not dare to face.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>How can a man dare to fight with the heavens.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"What kind of trash thing are you, come down to this god!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei raised his head indifferently and looked at the sky.
<br><br>The palm of his hand waved violently.
<br><br>The entire sky.
<br><br>It rippled and collapsed violently.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Unbelievable voices came out collectively from the countless experts of the Heaven's Immortal Hall who were secretly following this scene in the shadows.
<br><br>The sky.
<br><br>It had actually collapsed!
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>And Wu Fan, who saw it with his own eyes, felt his head explode and uttered a horrified voice.
<br><br>At this moment, in Bone Ben Wei's hand, he was pinching a light ball that shone with golden light, just like the sun.
<br><br>The light ball was pinched in the hands, struggling desperately, becoming distorted.
<br><br>A long, long time.
<br><br>It coalesced into a baby-like human face.
<br><br>"Ah ah!"
<br><br>"It's Master Bones."
<br><br>"Aaaaah Master Bones, I didn't know it was you, I was wrong, I was wrong!"
<br><br>The human face urgently emitted a pleading voice, desperately shouted: "Master Bones, you do not consider the small man, please let me go, I really did not know it was you, you see I am still just a child, why do you have to deal with me in general, right?"
<br><br>"Hmph, this god has long looked at you, if not my master is still spreading madness in this world, afraid to affect him, I would have killed you." Skeleton Ben Wei said coldly.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Ah this?"
<br><br>"Ah this, that master, here?"
<br><br>The baby's human face was so terrified that his voice turned abnormal, and the whole light mass flung violently.
<br><br>This amount of information, too much!
<br><br>"Do not go to obstruct him, or this real heaven, will not allow you."
<br><br>Bone Benevolent warned out, casually loosened his grip and shouted, "Get lost!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, Master Bones, yes Master Bones, such a big deal, should I erase the memories of this group of people?"
<br><br>"A bunch of hot chickens, it won't affect anything, just let them go."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Bones Benevolent shouted again.
<br><br>"Master Bones, I'm in."
<br><br>"Change the currency here, change it to gold coins!" Bones Ben Wei vocalized.
<br><br>"Ah this?"
<br><br>"Master Bones, why is this, I'm at least Tendou, and I don't care about the currency!" Tendou cried.
<br><br>"OK."
<br><br>Bone Benevolent grabbed it back again with one hand and cupped it in his hand.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Master Bones, I was wrong, from today onwards, only gold coins will be used in the entire Immortal World!"
<br><br>He hastily shouted.
<br><br>With a wave of his palm, Bone Benevolent threw the light ball into the sky, disappearing like a flash of stars.
<br><br>And the sky.
<br><br>And peace returned.
<br><br>But Wu Fan was not calm, just like a pile of mud fell to the ground, could not even say the words to beg for mercy.
<br><br>Heavenly Dao.
<br><br>The heavenly dao was actually in his hands at will.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>What kind of person is this!
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at him and seemed to have no more interest.
<br><br>The finger bones gently clicked.
<br><br>Wu Fan instantly turned into nothingness.
<br><br>And Wu Sign was also long ago tortured and lost, never to be reincarnated.
<br><br>On the ground, only an immortal sword remained.
<br><br>"Really, the master's trash also dare to rob."
<br><br>"Hardly caused me to pretend to be a pussy."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei picked up the immortal sword and directly tore through space to leave, returning to the Green Sky White Jade Building.
<br><br>With a wave of his palm.
<br><br>Everything in the room returned to its original state.
<br><br>On the bed.
<br><br>Dogs milk dose and other people with toothpicks in their mouths, crossing their legs, slanted a glance at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Brother, you're pretending, too big."
<br><br>"That is, you do not see what brother is a man, a dragon and a phoenix, a genius in the bone, handsome in the best, strong in the king, the girl to see all backwards, men see hate themselves not daughter body." Spiritual king floated, a messy blow.
<br><br>The words.
<br><br>At once let the skeleton Ben Wei up floating.
<br><br>Ang up the head a face of enjoyment.
<br><br>"Listen, listen, small spirit son this talent, Qing ah, small centipede small milk agent you can not compare ah."
<br><br>Once you hear this.
<br><br>Ao Qing night wind all embraced over, hugged the skeleton Ben Wei's thighs a face of flattery.
<br><br>"Hey hey hey, brother, you can't blame us for not having talent, after all, we really can't think of any words that can describe you in this world."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, this world reading sage also can not describe ah!"
<br><br>"Oops, spot on, the reward!"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei drifted.
<br><br>......
<br><br>And not far away, two youths rose from the ground, shouted in horror: "I'm not dead, I'm not dead, I'm actually not dead."
<br><br>And Li Tian, who was shriveled and collapsed in the corner, heard the sound and sat up at once.
<br><br>"Second brother, third brother, you guys."
<br><br>"You guys are alive, it's really great."
<br><br>Li Tian tears flowed down his eyes, and the three brothers hugged tightly together.
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>The voice of Bone Ben Wei came from the three people's minds.
<br><br>"You three guys, why don't you hurry up and get the money to pay the bill?"
<br><br>The three people's bodies trembled at the words.
<br><br>"It's Skeleton Grand Master, it's Skeleton Grand Master who saved us."
<br><br>"Quickly, go and thank Master Bones for his kindness!"
<br><br>The three people were so excited that they got up and hurried to the Green Sky White Jade House.
