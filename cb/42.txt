In a large hall that breathes eerie and shadowy all around.
<br><br>Two rows of experts with deep auras and expressionless faces stood at the bottom.
<br><br>A moment later, a middle-aged man with white hair came with a heavy aura, he was not angry, and the moment he came out, the experts at the lower head all lowered their heads.
<br><br>"Greetings to the Sovereign."
<br><br>"Greetings to the master."
<br><br>White hair man expressionless, slowly in the upper head of the throne after the seat, Ling Li's eyes surveyed the lower head of the crowd.
<br><br>The crowd did not dare to breathe, their bodies bent lower.
<br><br>A long time, the white-haired man waved his hand, the crowd got up as if relieved, it can be seen that he has absolute authority here.
<br><br>It's a pity that his right arm sleeve is now empty.
<br><br>He is the old ancestor of the Xuanwu Sect who dueled with the old man of Qingshan, Ning Xuanwu. And the people who laid hands on all the Xuanwu Sect's senior and Ning Xuanwu's own disciples.
<br><br>Since the defeat of Ning Xuanwu, Xuanwu Sect morale is low, at this moment to see him people are afraid to say anything. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>There was a dead silence.
<br><br>"How's the investigation?"
<br><br>Finally, Ning Xuanwu's majestic gaze swept over, and a hoarse voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>The people smiled and were silent.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ning Xuanwu was furious and shouted, "I ask you all, how is the investigation going, who can tell me where did that chopper in Lu Qingshan's hand come from?"
<br><br>"Master, I have captured a personal disciple of the Qingshan Sect here, perhaps I can get a clue from him." At this time, a woman with a hot body, wearing a revealing dress and holding two swords came out and said respectfully.
<br><br>She is Ning Xuanwu's personal disciple Demon Ling'er, talented and powerful, not to mention the most defensible is her hot body and beauty, countless enemies who fought with her, have been charmed by her beauty, but once he was careless, he was greeted by Demon Ling'er's double-edged killing.
<br><br>"Bring it up."
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu waved his hand.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The demon spirit child swept out of the hall like lightning and reappeared with a white-robed youth in her hand.
<br><br>"Let go of me, let go of me." The white-robed youth shouted untamedly, "Do you know who I am and how dare you grab me, I am the personal disciple of the Castle Peak Sect, Yu Wujie, if you don't let go of me, you will suffer a devastating blow from the Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>"Slap!"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er slapped Yu Wujie's face.
<br><br>"You, how dare you hit me?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie was furious, he had never been hit by anyone since he grew up, it was a great shame.
<br><br>But what greeted him was another slap from Demon Ling'er, causing him to fly straight backwards to the ground.
<br><br>Even more humiliated, he climbed up and tried to fight back, only to find that a white-haired man appeared above his head, looking at him with cold eyes.
<br><br>"Who are you?" Yu Wujie shouted.
<br><br>"Ning Xuanwu."
<br><br>"What?" Yu Wujie was shocked, he never thought that the man in front of him was actually the Xuanwu Ancestor, so wouldn't he have been caught in the Xuanwu Sect?
<br><br>"I ask you, where did Lu Qingshan get that sword?" The Xuanwu Old Ancestor asked with a hoarse voice as he stood tall.
<br><br>"Why should I tell you?" Although he knew it was Ning Xuanwu, Yu Wujie still shouted nonchalantly.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's gaze lifted and he said in a deep voice, "You're not afraid of me?"
<br><br>"Why should I be afraid of you, just a defeated servant of my clan's ancestor, I advise you to let me go quickly, or else my ancestor will come with his divine sword and will make you doom." Yu Wujie shouted threateningly.
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Xuanwu said lightly.
<br><br>In the next instant, a cloying aura erupted from him, and Yu Wujie, who was on the ground, was suddenly sucked into midair.
<br><br>"I'll ask you once more, say or not say." The Xuanwu old ancestor said hoarsely.
<br><br>"No." Yu Wujie said unyieldingly.
<br><br>Xuanwu Old Ancestor's eyes narrowed, his palm moved and grabbed Yu Wujie's neck, the powerful force immediately made Yu Wujie's veins exposed, at the same time, a huge pressure was also squeezing on Yu Wujie's body.
<br><br>"Ah, I'm wrong I'm wrong, I said."
<br><br>Feeling the real death coming, Yu Wujie didn't persist for a moment and hurriedly begged for mercy.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The Xuanwu Old Ancestor's palm moved and Yu Wujie fell heavily to the ground.
<br><br>When the crowd saw this, they revealed contemptuous eyes, they thought it was a hard bone, but it was a waste that was softer than a persimmon.
<br><br>"Cough cough cough."
<br><br>Yu Wujie coughed sharply, seeing the impatience of the Xuanwu old ancestor, he hurriedly said, "I don't know if what I said is accurate, but I got the news from my master, saying that it was from a high person in Pingjiang City."
<br><br>"A high person in Pingjiang City?" Xuanwu old ancestor's face was angry, a foot on Yu Wujie's chest, said in a deep voice: "Where is there any high person in Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>"Really, really, I dare not lie to you, and my master also said that he opened a small martial arts school in Pingjiang City, it's true!" Yu Wujie shouted.
<br><br>"Small martial arts school?"
<br><br>The Xuanwu ancestor saw that Yu Wujie did not look like he was lying, so he let go of him and returned to the top, frowning and pondering.
<br><br>A moment later, he said in a deep voice, "Wu-Chen, go to Pingjiang City and poke around."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>A youth with a slim figure and a sickly face walked out, then with a flash of his body, he went down the mountain ......
