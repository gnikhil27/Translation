"I also don't know how this Qi luck value can be obtained other than that!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his forehead and couldn't help but speculate.
<br><br>After asking for a long time, the system didn't have a half-hearted response.
<br><br>So it seems that it is estimated to be only able to rely on apprentices to obtain.
<br><br>After all, before this kind of exchange store is not available, open the sect to receive a disciple only.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"I hope this group of trash can have a put to break out some big name out of it, a one-time to me to grow a few hundred thousands of Qi luck value!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh.
<br><br>He really wants to get a bully fighters around, not like the skeleton Ben Wei a few, it is estimated to encounter a tiger can not fight. At best, they can only be brought out to relieve the boredom.
<br><br>Just at this time.
<br><br>A cloudy wind forced to come. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Let Yi Feng could not help but fight a shiver.
<br><br>It is to see, in front of the forest inside, there are a dozen behemoths.
<br><br>The body reaches two feet, yellow fur is spread with black spots.
<br><br>"Damn, really say what comes!"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned out a cursing voice.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>It is a dozen tigers appeared in front of you.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng panic a group.
<br><br>He has practiced martial arts, encountered one or two, when there are weapons may be able to tangle a couple.
<br><br>But encountered a dozen, basically only waiting for death.
<br><br>In short, he the circus is impossible to be the opponent of these dozen tigers.
<br><br>Yi Feng drew his legs and ran.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that Bones Ben Wei, that douchebag, actually stuck his waist and raised his middle finger towards a dozen tigers.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed.
<br><br>You know that the tigers in this world are not like the tigers in the previous world, because of the exuberant aura, so even ordinary animals, spiritual intelligence is far from the previous world can be compared.
<br><br>So this middle finger provocative action of Bone Ben Wei will undoubtedly make the dozen tigers go crazy.
<br><br>A dozen tigers went crazy, Bones Ben Wei himself is nothing.
<br><br>This is a skeleton, broken up can still be put together, but the fucking drag is his Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Dog, let you wave, do not hurry to me run."
<br><br>Yi Feng kicked Bone Ben Wei to the ground, grabbed his black robe, dragged and began to run.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>A dozen tigers and Yi Feng's circus launched a fierce chase.
<br><br>But the sky is not as it should be, not only did not get rid of a dozen tigers chasing, the circus is instead to a dead end.
<br><br>In front of them was a cliff.
<br><br>It was more than ten feet deep.
<br><br>And below the cliff was a river so murky that it was black.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>A dozen angry tigers pounced in unison accompanied by a pleasant roar.
<br><br>"Damn, I can only jump."
<br><br>Yi Feng gritted his teeth and kicked the black bear doggies down one by one, and finally he himself was a slammer down.
<br><br>After all, in his opinion.
<br><br>Jump down there is a way to live.
<br><br>If you do not jump, he circus in addition to the skeleton Ben Wei this demolition of the immortal guy, I'm afraid that the whole army will have to be wiped out.
<br><br>So jump, is definitely a wise move!
<br><br>Soft evening breeze gently blowing, the green grass next to the river emits a faint aroma.
<br><br>The wretched Yi Feng with a circus, while grabbing the pants just off, while using a stone to viciously smash a half-foot-long black fish, smashing it to a bloody pulp.
<br><br>Black fish eyes flooded with malice.
<br><br>Deceive the fish too much, deceive the fish too much!
<br><br>It as this black river in the dominant, immortal level existence, but actually by a small human and a few small demons to bully, simply can not tolerate.
<br><br>It fish bubble eyes flashed a wicked color.
<br><br>Tsk.
<br><br>A few of my brothers will be here soon, let's see what you few can do to resist.
<br><br>Die!
<br><br>Then from the water next to it, four black fish of the same size as it, opened its huge mouth, with a terrifying devouring power, and pounced towards Yi Feng several people.
<br><br>"Ya?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng's mouth opened.
<br><br>This kind of ugly and big fish actually dared to come?
<br><br>"Get lost you motherfucker!"
<br><br>Yi Feng yanked his shoe in his hand and pumped it over.
<br><br>The four black fish just rushed up, was immediately drawn over on the shore, rolled up the dead fish eyes, struggling no longer struggle a little, so dead.
<br><br>The first black fish is the eyes of a glare, was actually stunned alive fainted.
<br><br>"Cut!"
<br><br>"Tiger we can not deal with, but also can not deal with you a few dead fish?"
<br><br>Yi Feng continued to wring his pants, bare feet emanated cursing and swearing.
<br><br>"Good ...... good strong!"
<br><br>And not far away on the road, a caravan witnessed the whole scene.
<br><br>Especially the exquisite face in the carriage that lifted the curtain, could not help but make a surprised sound.
<br><br>They were the Lingxu Realm Yuan Family, about to transport a batch of special supplies back to the Yuan Family, due to the uniqueness of this batch of supplies, it simply could not be put into the storage ring, so a group of Xian-level experts, only able to use such a primitive way to transport.
<br><br>And this black river side, it is their way back to Yuan family must pass.
<br><br>As a local power, they know exactly what is in this black river.
<br><br>The five black witch desolate fish, rumored to be the fierce creatures that survived the last era, they hijacked the river and did nothing wrong, turning an originally clear and bottomless river clear stream into a puddle of black water, making the nearby forces scared.
<br><br>As for their specific strength, there is no way to know, only that it is very strong and powerful.
<br><br>Because those who have seen them, have died.
<br><br>Therefore, they came all the way along the Black River, basically in fear of these five Black Witch Desolate Fish coming out to cause trouble.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What they didn't expect was that just when they were scared and praying in their hearts that these five Black Witch Desolate Fish didn't find them, they saw such a surprising scene.
<br><br>A youth, using a shoe to directly whip them to death.
<br><br>This visual horror is simply impossible to describe in words.
<br><br>Can't help but, that captivating face looking at Yi Feng's gaze, full of hot.
