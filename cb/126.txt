"What?"
<br><br>"You guys actually met that one?" Li Renhao asked in surprise, "I thought that one had left long ago, but it turns out that he is still in the mountain, how about it Auntie, Master, is that one really that terrifying?"
<br><br>At that, the two nodded solemnly.
<br><br>In unison, they said, "It's quite a bit more terrifying than you think, do you know why the high-grade demonic beasts in this mountain suddenly disappeared?"
<br><br>"Well?"
<br><br>"It is him, all the demon beasts in this mountain above the demon spirit, all attracted together, and then a net!"
<br><br>Li Renhao slightly stared at the eyes, astonished for a long time can not say a word, a long time before murmuring: "So it is, from the evening, originally everywhere in the mountain range is demon spirit, suddenly silent remains, so it is the work of this one."
<br><br>"Speaking of which, when I met with this one just now, he also gifted him and your master some opportunities, your aunt me ah, breakthrough Martial Sect is just around the corner!" Li Jiaxin said with a smile on her face.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin's words once again surprised Li Renhao to the extreme.
<br><br>It seemed that that one was indeed much more terrifying than she had imagined.
<br><br>"Congratulations aunt." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Congratulations to the master."
<br><br>Li Renhao said respectfully, but she was distracted as she spoke.
<br><br>In her mind, a figure suddenly came to mind.
<br><br>Although and this single figure, only a casual encounter, but the latter that naturally permeated the sense of dust, but in her mind save save dissipate.
<br><br>In particular, he was in the mountain range of demonic beasts, obviously a mortal body, but still unhurried appearance brought her a great amazement.
<br><br>Perhaps he is more because the newborn calf is not afraid of the tiger.
<br><br>But it must be said that his calmness made her originally panicked state of mind seem to have been affected a little, making her heart much more relaxed when she faced many battles before.
<br><br>Just, will people always have such good luck?
<br><br>Now that the mountain range has returned to peace, are you, are you still alive?
<br><br>"Ren Hao, let's hurry up and set off!" At this time, Li Jiaxin said urgently, "When we go down the mountain, we can just see if that senior is still around, if he is still around, take you to pay him a visit!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, an expert of this level, meeting one would still be of great benefit to you!" Xu Mozhu also said hurriedly at the side.
<br><br>As the two spoke, they glanced at each other.
<br><br>Obviously, there is the same purpose.
<br><br>If the time to see that one, by that one look good, and then to Li Renhao also bring some opportunity, simply can not be better!
<br><br>"Auntie master, I know you guys for my sake, but I am not acquainted with the expert you said stranger." Li Renhao obviously saw what the two people had in mind and said slightly apologetically, "So I don't really want to bother people, and besides, I have more important things to do."
<br><br>At those words, the two Li Jiaxin's eyebrows instantly frowned.
<br><br>"Ren Hao, what exactly is more important than meeting this senior?" Xu Mozhu frowned and said in a serious tone, "Do you know that if you can make that senior like, his casual guidance will be able to make you take many detours on your cultivation path, and if you can give you something more, there will be inexhaustible benefits for you in your life ah!"
<br><br>"Yes Jen well, today, hurry up and take advantage of that senior is still in the mountain, follow me and your master to go to pay respect to that senior, is the best!" Li Jiaxin also persuaded at the side.
<br><br>"I appreciate the kindness of my master and aunt, but you know that I am never a climber, forgive me for not being able to promise you for now." Li Renhao frowned her pretty eyebrows and said slightly anxiously, "And I do have important things to do."
<br><br>"You child, why are you so stubborn?" Li Jiaxin frowned and softly lectured, "Also, you do tell us, what is it that is more important than this?"
<br><br>"I want to find someone."
<br><br>Li Renhao said.
<br><br>"What kind of person?"
<br><br>The two Li Jiaxin were full of doubts.
<br><br>"A mortal."
<br><br>Li Renhao bit her red lips tightly.
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>The two people were almost stunned and said busily, "What do you want a mortal for?"
<br><br>"He ......"
<br><br>Li Renhao opened her red lips, then gave the two people a rough idea of the encounter that occurred with that single figure in the mountain range.
<br><br>"So, I want to find him." Li Renhao said.
<br><br>"Ugh, you're a child at heart!" Li Jiaxin shook her head and said, "Not to mention that his death or survival as a mortal is not worth mentioning, to take a step back, how could he survive as a mortal in this mountain?"
<br><br>"He was lucky ......," Li Renhao forcefully argued.
<br><br>"Good luck?"
<br><br>"Huh ......"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin eyes can not help but reveal mockery, lesson: "luck is not always favored a person, a mortal in this mountain range ten deaths ten lives, you have to remember, the only thing that can really turn the tide is the strength in the hands."
<br><br>"But, I believe he ......"
<br><br>Li Renhao said, but when it comes to this, she is also quite out of breath.
<br><br>"What's the use of you believing, even you yourself did not also say, in the last time you parted, countless demon king demon spirits gathered in his direction, do you think these demon king demon spirits will not find a mortal?" Li Jiaxin lectured.
<br><br>At these words, Li Renhao's jade hand holding the sword subconsciously tightened, his body trembled slightly, and his eyes couldn't help but dim down.
<br><br>In truth.
<br><br>She also had such an expectation.
<br><br>Only, she wants to see if there is any miracle happen again!
<br><br>"Stop being obsessed, go, immediately come with us to pay respect to that senior!" At this moment, Xu Mozhu said forcefully.
<br><br>On the side, Li Jiaxin's attitude also hardened.
<br><br>Obviously, in their eyes, a mortal's death or life was not worth mentioning compared to meeting that senior.
<br><br>What's more, it was a mortal who had most likely already become a demon beast's ration?
