"It seems that we will have to serve the gentleman for breakfast tomorrow morning."
<br><br>Grand Master Wang said leisurely.
<br><br>At the same time as he spoke, an appalling light flashed in his eyes, and his original old appearance suddenly became spirited, while the walking stick in his hand bloomed with a dazzling light under the urging of his Yuan Qi.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Pork Rong answered, and his aura also became vast, and then a sharp pig-killing knife was pulled out by him.
<br><br>Once the pig-killing knife came out, it was covered with a cold aura under the urging of Yuan Qi.
<br><br>"Old man, I'll go first, I can't beat you in helping me!"
<br><br>Said, pork rong stepped on the feet of the long rain boots stepped out of the air, in the blink of an eye flew above the head of the giant auger.
<br><br>"Eat me a knife."
<br><br>With a shout, pork rong hand pig killing knife carrying a cold light, a knife cut down.
<br><br>The moment the knife light fell, dragged out a thousand feet of knife mane, making the entire sky knife Qi. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Under the shocked and staggering gaze of the crowd, this slash landed directly on top of the giant jiao's body.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>The moment of contact, sparks rose from the giant jiao's body, and along with the giant jiao's miserable screams, this slash destroyed and cut it into two halves.
<br><br>"Boom boom!"
<br><br>And the two remaining bodies, like two big mountains, smashed down on the ground.
<br><br>A thousand feet in circumference was razed to the ground.
<br><br>Kicking up sky-rushing dust ......
<br><br>"How terrifying!"
<br><br>"It actually cut down the Demon Emperor with one slash."
<br><br>"Martial Emperor expert, this person must be a Martial Emperor expert!"
<br><br>This scene, shocked the crowd present scalp numb, mouth have exclaimed out, no wonder these old man let the two major forces also so afraid, so is the Martial Emperor expert.
<br><br>This kind of expert, but the entire Immortal River continent's peak ah!
<br><br>The crowd never thought that they would be lucky enough to see such a person today, and their gazes towards Pork Rong were filled with admiration for a while.
<br><br>And Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu mouth the same backwards cold breath, although they had known that the two are Martial Emperor experts heart prepared, but when seeing this scene with their own eyes, the heart still can not keep calm.
<br><br>But at that moment, that was cut into two giant auger, and then fly up high.
<br><br>What was even more unbelievable was that the two bodies were put back together, and its wounds were recovering at a visible rate, as if it had never been wounded before.
<br><br>"It's really not that simple!"
<br><br>Pork Rong eyes flickered with gravity, turned back towards old man Wang and shouted, "Old man, it seems that you need to give a hand."
<br><br>Almost as soon as Porky Rong's voice fell, Old Man Wang swept out into the air with his staff.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>The walking stick in his hand turned into a thousand feet in extent and smashed into the giant auger's head with a bang.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A sound explosion.
<br><br>The giant jiao that had just flown up, smashed to the ground again with a bang.
<br><br>"Another Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>And seeing this scene, the crowd present could not help but exclaim once again.
<br><br>And Li Yihan's face was white as she stood in the corner, her whole body had turned numb, these people, simply refreshing her perceptions one at a time.
<br><br>But what people didn't expect was that the giant auger that smashed to the ground actually moved again, and its head slowly raised.
<br><br>"Tsk."
<br><br>"I really didn't expect that I would run into two human Martial Emperors, it's really good, it was just a toothsome fight, but now it seems that I can have a big meal!"
<br><br>He re-coiled in mid-air and looked at the two Pork Rong with a face full of disdain.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>His huge mouth opened, a terrifying energy coalesced, and then fired out.
<br><br>Seeing this, Pork Rong's two faces changed, but the two of them just had time to assume a defensive stance before this terrifying energy already pounced on them.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A mushroom cloud rose in the sky.
<br><br>And Pork Rong and Old Man Wang spat out a mouthful of blood almost simultaneously and flew backwards.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Not bad, actually carried my blow!"
<br><br>The giant augur laughed coldly, full of teasing.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Two Martial Emperors are no match."
<br><br>The defeat of the two Pork Rong caused everyone present to sweat coldly, because if this giant jiao were to go on a killing spree, no one on the scene would be able to run away, I'm afraid.
<br><br>"Everyone hurry up and run apart in advance."
<br><br>The more you think about it, the more panic, I do not know who shouted a sentence, the panic of the crowd suddenly like flies in all directions to fly out.
<br><br>However, they had just flown out a short distance when they were blocked by an invisible barrier.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"A domain?"
<br><br>Seeing this, pork rong and old man Wang's face changed, never thought that this giant auger actually has a domain.
<br><br>Than the giant auger can rise from the dead, which is more they feel gloomy. After all, this kind of resurrection is not the real sense of resurrection, but only some means unique to demonic beasts.
<br><br>But having a domain is completely different.
<br><br>Because the Martial Emperor is much more complicated than other realms, there are ten realms in total. In each realm, there is a heavenly tribulation, and after passing the tribulation, it is like being transformed and having life again.
<br><br>Therefore, the ten realms of martial emperor is also called ten life emperor realm, after crossing the ten life emperor realm, will be able to sit on the ground to become immortal.
<br><br>The first life martial emperor or first life demon emperor, just stepped into the emperor this realm, its strength compared to the martial saint greatly increased, there is not much characteristics.
<br><br>But to the second life after the martial emperor, the real advantages of the martial emperor came to the fore.
<br><br>And the most notable one is the first control of the domain.
<br><br>In the scope of their own domain, can significantly enhance their own attack power not to mention, but also able to significantly weaken the opponent's strength.
<br><br>The barrier that stopped these people from leaving, it is clear that the field of this giant auger worked.
<br><br>And with the field, it also means that this giant auger is two life demon emperor, but old man Wang and pork rong two, are only one life martial emperor.
<br><br>Seemingly only one life difference, but in fact, the difference between the sky and the earth.
<br><br>If not for the weapons given by Mr., I'm afraid that their attacks can only break the defense of the giant auger at best!
<br><br>"Forget it, this emperor will settle you all as soon as possible and feast on you!"
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>At this time, a hissing roar came from the giant auger, and another huge wave of energy coalesced from his mouth, then surged out.
<br><br>"Hoo ......"
<br><br>The sky carried a pleasing sound of breaking wind, and in the blink of an eye, it reached the head of the two pork rong.
<br><br>The two people's faces changed greatly and took the weapon Yi Feng gave them to block in front of them.
<br><br>"Block!"
<br><br>A burst of sound, narrowly blocked the blow, but they just breathed a sigh of relief, but found that the dissipating giant auger energy, steeply began to solidify.
<br><br>With two people as the range, the air began to freeze and freeze.
<br><br>"Ka ka ka ka ......"
<br><br>The ice layer spread from the air, climbing up the hands and feet of Pork Rong and old man Wang subsequently spread throughout the body.
<br><br>In less than a few moments, the two people frozen on the spot.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Yang Tianyu and others were scared to death, the two great Martial Emperors were actually frozen so?
<br><br>And they can't run and run, won't they definitely die?
<br><br>"See how you still struggle, just die!"
<br><br>Giant Jiao coldly shouted, an ice arrow with cold intent slowly condensed out from his mouth, directly locking the two Pork Rong.
<br><br>Although the two were frozen unable to move, but the consciousness is still there, see this ice pillar, the heart finally panicked, felt a strong threat of death.
<br><br>The other cultivators, too, were full of death.
<br><br>Because Pork Rong and old man Wang is their hope to live, but now ......
<br><br>However, just as that ice arrow was about to be sent out, a close call, an arrogant voice came from the ground.
<br><br>"Hey, little reptile, who told you to be so arrogant?"
