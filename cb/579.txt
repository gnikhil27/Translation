"Stop!"
<br><br>In the nick of time, Liu Yan shouted sternly, his ghostly body swept out and stopped in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>He understood that Guo Shijie had deliberately made a move against this disciple in order to publicly deflate her face at Star Peak.
<br><br>So how would she let Guo Shijie have his way?
<br><br>Furthermore, to take a step back, no matter how this Human Immortal's disciple was admitted, but it all belonged to his Star Peak.
<br><br>Since they are her Star Peak people, in front of her, no matter what, they will protect the disciples under their seats safely.
<br><br>"Hmph, Liu Yan, this kid is obviously mixed in, my move is for your Star Peak's sake, don't give your face away." Guo Shijie said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Put your mother's fart, for the sake of my Star Peak, you can really say it." Liu Yan sneered.
<br><br>"Hmph, he is a human immortal, not even reached the threshold of joining the sect, what is it if not a spy mixed in, maybe it is to steal information from my sect, I am now clearly perceiving and finding out for you, and you still want to stop me?" Guo Shijie laughed coldly, "Or is it true that your Star Peak has fallen to such a state that this human immortal is really the one you have collected?"
<br><br>"He is the one I, Liu Yan, took in, what about you?"
<br><br>"He is now my Star Peak disciple, if you have the guts, you give me a try to move?" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Liu Yan immortal yuan four rolls, a robe windless automatic, stopped in front of Yi Feng like a female god of war, directly pulled out the long sword in his hand.
<br><br>The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to its customers.
<br><br>Even not only the disciples of the Star Peak, next to the Heaven and Earth Peak and his Sun and Moon Peak disciples are also the same.
<br><br>After all, for many disciples, it is a great thing to have a peak master who is so protective.
<br><br>This caused Guo Shijie to frown.
<br><br>Liu Yan's strength was not weaker than his.
<br><br>If they really fought, he wouldn't necessarily be able to get a good deal.
<br><br>He just never thought that he just wanted to humiliate Star Hall in public, but instead of humiliating him, he gave Liu Yan a wave of momentum.
<br><br>"Humph, what are you looking at, why don't you hurry up and leave?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie gave a cold snort in anger, and led the disciples under his seat to leave in a rage.
<br><br>After seeing Guo Shijie leave, Liu Yan then collected the immortal energy on his body and put away his long sword.
<br><br>"How are you, are you alright?"
<br><br>She looked at Yi Feng and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"I'm fine."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded gratefully towards her.
<br><br>"Although I am also curious, you a human immortal how to pass the audit to enter, but come are here, I also do not deep investigation, so stay well in the Star Peak, if someone other peaks bully you, you can inform our Star Peak master brothers, you can also tell me, all will protect you."
<br><br>Liu Yan explained in a soft voice.
<br><br>After saying that, she was ready to take the Star Peak disciples to leave.
<br><br>However, as she left, Yi Feng lightly called out to her, "Peak Master."
<br><br>"Is there anything else?" She asked.
<br><br>"Peak Master, may I ask that than just now, what is the strength?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Ninth Turn Xuan Xian."
<br><br>Despite not knowing why Yi Feng asked the question, Liu Yan said truthfully.
<br><br>"Only a Ninth Turn Xuan Xian, just that much strength and you're so dragged?"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>Shit.
<br><br>Thought he was a tough guy.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a new one.
<br><br>But these words, but ushered in Liu Yan astonished gaze.
<br><br>A human immortal, despise the ninth turn Xuan Xian?
<br><br>This makes her do not know what to say.
<br><br>"The strength of a Ninth Turn Xuan Xian Immortal is not something you can imagine, it's better to maintain a little respect!" She gently reminded.
<br><br>But Yi Feng did not care about that.
<br><br>He human immortal how, human immortal is now also a big brother, right, under the seat of a large number of reincarnation immortal realm experts.
<br><br>Anyway, this Guo Shijie, just want to kill him in mind he is clear to see.
<br><br>This revenge.
<br><br>He is remembered.
<br><br>Therefore, just as Liu Yan was about to leave, Yi Feng next to him spoke out again.
<br><br>"Peak Master, do you want to finish off that than just now?"
<br><br>"Do you want me to help you finish him off?"
<br><br>This made Liu Yan's face almost twitch up, his forehead filled with black lines.
<br><br>The Human Immortal said that he wanted to finish off the Ninth Turn Xuan Xian.
<br><br>This Human Immortal disciple, ah, was really naive and cute.
<br><br>She sighed and softly comforted, "Although I know that the heart harbors hatred, you and Guo Shijie are not on the same level, so it's better to give up this idea."
<br><br>"And he's a narrow-minded person, so don't let him know about what you just said, or he might turn against you."
<br><br>"As for the aggravation you suffered today ......"
<br><br>"I'll try to compensate you in other ways."
<br><br>Liu Yan said softly.
<br><br>"You don't believe me, Peak Master?" Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"I don't disbelieve you, it's just that you can't now, if you want to take revenge, cultivate well and strive for a day in the future when you can do it." Liu Yan patted Yi Feng's shoulder, gave a long explanation, and left towards the side.
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed breathlessly.
<br><br>It is also.
<br><br>He was only a Human Immortal right now, so naturally no one would believe him when he said he would take out a Ninth Turn Xuan Immortal.
<br><br>But he didn't need anyone to believe it either.
<br><br>When he brought his little brothers on the back garden over, he was bound to take out that what's-his-name Guo Shijie directly.
