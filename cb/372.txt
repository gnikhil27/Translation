Hiss!
<br><br>What kind of person is this that has such a big appetite and actually wants to capture Su Xuanjun as well?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Looking at the strength of Skeleton Benevolence, these few people are indeed a great enemy as well, and it would be good to tell the news here to the continental lord as soon as possible.
<br><br>Only, in the hands of this person at the moment, how to pass the news out?
<br><br>Just when the immortal world demons are anxious, just leaving Yi Feng's footsteps suddenly beat, turned back and landed his gaze on the cloud elephant.
<br><br>"The others stay, this elephant looks too shabby, throw away throw away."
<br><br>Waving his hand, Yi Feng passed out a voice.
<br><br>What?
<br><br>However, hearing Yi Feng's words, the immortal world demons were violently shocked.
<br><br>What kind of operation is this? One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The cloud elephant is actually going to be put back, is not afraid that he will go back to inform the news?
<br><br>This operation directly confused the immortal world demons.
<br><br>This person, in the end, is playing tricks, or is it really powerful to the point of this kind of emboldened?
<br><br>Cloud elephant was dragged away by skeleton Ben Wei ......
<br><br>with the hopeful gaze of the immortal world's demons.
<br><br>Because no matter what attention Yi Feng is playing, cloud elephant has become their lifesaver, at least to put out the news here.
<br><br>Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun sat on top of the main hall, holding the daily meeting.
<br><br>After the regular business was finished, someone under his command couldn't help but ask, "Lord, it has been several days since Black Feather led the demons down to the world, why hasn't he returned yet?"
<br><br>"Yes, according to reason, with that kind of formation plus the immortal weapon of the continent lord, they should have solved the trouble quickly."
<br><br>"Well, it's a bit long."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun frowned slightly, but still said: "But I'm still relieved that Black Feather and the others are doing their job, there should be some kind of small accident, they should be back soon, you guys just rest easy."
<br><br>"Lord, I think it's better to send someone to see ah, after all, black feather with the Lord's immortal weapon, in case something happens, is not trivial ah."
<br><br>"Yes, Lord of the Continent, should we send someone down to take a look."
<br><br>The crowd said worriedly.
<br><br>"You guys are still too much worried, don't worry."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun pressed his hand.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, a subordinate rushed to report.
<br><br>"Report."
<br><br>"The Cloud Elephant Golden Immortal has returned."
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's eyes lit up and he laughed, "How about it, isn't it back?"
<br><br>The crowd lowered their heads one after another.
<br><br>"It's still the continent master who is wise."
<br><br>"We are convinced."
<br><br>"Okay, okay, you guys still have something to learn about human hearts." Su Xuanjun laughed and said, "Okay, okay, let's cut the small talk and go with me to greet them."
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>With a wave of Su Xuanjun's hand, a huge force swept up all the people present and sent them flying towards the outside of the hall.
<br><br>However, to Su Xuanjun's surprise, only Yun Xiang was alone outside the hall.
<br><br>And Yunxiang was also in a mess, a dead mother's appearance.
<br><br>This made Su Xuanjun's heart a thud.
<br><br>An arrow step rushed over and grabbed Yunxiang's shoulder, asking in a deep voice: "What's going on?"
<br><br>"Lord of the Continent, something big has happened, several terrifying figures have appeared in the lower realm and have wiped us out." Yun Xiang said with a pale face.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"How could this happen?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's face changed dramatically.
<br><br>The others in the field were also stony-faced.
<br><br>A dozen Demon Golden Immortals descending into the world were wiped out in one go, this was definitely considered a big accident.
<br><br>"By the way, Black Feather, where is Black Feather?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun remembered something and grabbed the cloud elephant again and asked, "He carries the immortal weapon I gave him, does he not have a fighting chance even against them?"
<br><br>"Did he not borrow the immortal weapon for you to break out?"
