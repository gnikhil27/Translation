"The only two lucky ones?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue was slightly surprised, but even more puzzled.
<br><br>"The Ancient God Race, you know about it, right?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan asked.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue instantly covered her red lips.
<br><br>"Not bad!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan nodded solemnly, while telling Luo Lanxue everything about the Zhong Qing divine race's meridian.
<br><br>This news fell on Luo Lanxue's ears, and immediately set off shocking waves in her heart, and her eyes also flashed with a strong look of excitement.
<br><br>"I can't believe that I'm here, sir, witnessing the awakening of the descendants of the Gods in the Immortal River Continent for two million years!" This kind of glory also made Luo Lanxue feel doubly honored.
<br><br>"By the way, there's also this leftover medicine!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan pointed to the medicine jar in his hand and said hurriedly, "Do you know that the lowest grade medicine for awakening the meridians of the God race is the ninth grade, and it has even reached the Immortal grade!"
<br><br>Once again, Luo Lanxue's eyes widened. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I'll take a sip first."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan was full of expectation, took a small sip and pursed his lips again.
<br><br>A moment later, he then felt a huge power running around his body, and the early Martial King instantly felt like he had reached the critical point.
<br><br>"Breakthrough, mid Martial King!"
<br><br>Finally, Lu Qingshan shouted and swept straight up to the roof of the room, and immediately sat on top of the cloud top of the Qingtian Gate, emitting a powerful aura all over his body.
<br><br>"What a powerful efficacy!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue was stunned.
<br><br>Her master, it seemed that he had only broken through not long ago!
<br><br>After a long time, after the breakthrough, Lu Qingshan sat back with a strong spirit, his face was rosy as he redirected his gaze to the medicine jar, and after two small sips, he handed the medicine jar in his hand to Luo Lanxue and said, "Disciple, this medicine is too powerful, Luo Li is too young now, instead it will impact badly on her meridians, you drink the next one, remember to drink it right away, otherwise the medicine power will disperse, and at the same time not to waste a little bit!"
<br><br>He just finished, hiccuped, and was stunned in place.
<br><br>He just fell down, without saying a word, once again rushed up to the roof.
<br><br>Apparently, he was once again about to break through.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Huge power converged towards Lu Qingshan, the aura on his body was rising, and soon after, he broke through from the middle stage of Martial King to the late stage, followed by a breakthrough to Martial King Great Perfection.
<br><br>And when Luo Lanxue saw this, she also became impatient and didn't even care about aesthetics, she picked up the medicine jar and started drinking!
<br><br>Just as she finished drinking the medicine inside the jar, she felt a powerful force hit her dantian, and her cultivation level also climbed at this moment.
<br><br>The middle stage of Great Martial Master.
<br><br>Late Martial Master.
<br><br>Great Martial Master complete.
<br><br>Pre-Martial Spirit, late, mid, late ......
<br><br>Until finally, she also broke through to the Martial Spirit Perfection realm, to this realm, the house has long been unable to accommodate her, she also immediately broke through the roof, began to break through in the sky.
<br><br>After a long time, forced by the realm of high and low, Luo Lanxue first landed down, full of excitement towards the jar of medicine continued to look, found that there is still some residue, she continued to hold the jar of medicine to drink.
<br><br>However, just as she finished drinking, the old ancestor of Castle Peak came down from the sky, and shouted out of his mouth, "Disciple, wait, leave me another sip."
<br><br>Seeing this, Luo Lanxue hurriedly explained, "Master, the last sip, has been drunk by me, I ......"
<br><br>Just finished, Luo Lanxue rose to the sky again.
<br><br>And the realm, also from Martial Spirit Great Perfection, towards Martial King advance!
<br><br>Qingshan old man's face changed slightly, he Martial King is one step short, how can this be good, looking at that medicine jar, a gnash of teeth, no longer care about what dignity, palms pick up that medicine residue and gnawed.
<br><br>Sure enough, the pill dregs are also still effective.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"The coveted Martial Emperor, I, Lu Qingshan, have finally broken through!"
<br><br>With loud laughter, the old ancestor of Castle Peak rose to the sky again since Luo Lanxue.
<br><br>And the crowd of disciples of the Castle Peak Sect had long been stunned under this terrifying heavenly might of the two.
<br><br>Of course, more is the surprise.
<br><br>The stronger the battle power of the senior members of the Castle Peak Sect, the stronger the strength of the Castle Peak Sect, and they were naturally able to follow the rising tide.
<br><br>For a time, the entire Qingshan Sect fell into an unprecedented shout.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, breakthrough Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>"Old ancestor, breakthrough Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>The shout spread to every corner of the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>In an ancient castle, a previous elder, whose lower body was paralyzed due to a gongfu problem, stood up violently, trembling, and an excited voice shouted out from his mouth.
<br><br>"The old ancestor has broken through the Martial Emperor, my Green Mountain Sect, is back at the top again!"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>On the back mountain, a grave exploded.
<br><br>An old man who had sealed himself in the tomb because his time was almost up and was a contemporary of the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak rushed out with his head cloaked.
<br><br>"My Castle Peak Sect, rising again, I will die in peace!"
<br><br>In the Martial Arts Pavilion.
<br><br>A crippled old man sweeping the floor suddenly dropped the broom in his hand and burst out with unprecedented speed to fly out.
<br><br>All at once, various upper elders of the Castle Peak Sect, countless older generations ran out, turning into a pair of hot eyes, looking at the huge breakthrough movement in the sky!
