"If you say so, then I'm getting curious."
<br><br>"Delaying me so much time, I hope you won't let me down."
<br><br>Bai Shangyi glanced at the old man and said quietly.
<br><br>The old man subconsciously shivered.
<br><br>But remembering that thing, he still felt there felt confident, after all, this kind of thing even in their Lingxu Realm he had never seen before.
<br><br>"Please rest assured, Goddess."
<br><br>The old man said respectfully.
<br><br>"One look will tell."
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi flicked his palm and the door in front of him opened automatically.
<br><br>It was an ordinary grocery store.
<br><br>In a corner, an elderly couple embraced together, looking at Bai Shouyi warily, their eyes full of fear. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Bai Shallow One just faintly swept a glance, then directly fixed his gaze on the portrait on the wall.
<br><br>"The power of the Great Dao."
<br><br>"It's really something good."
<br><br>She raised her lips.
<br><br>Obviously, she was also surprised to be able to see such a painting here.
<br><br>"Goddess, there's also that statue that's placed there." The old man pointed to the statue that was placed on the cabinet.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi inclined his head to look.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>There was also a statue on the cabinet.
<br><br>The statue is a figure dressed in black robes, robes printed with red auspicious clouds pattern, his eyes indifferent, with six nose studs, forehead also wearer of a hair band, the hair band has a four vertical and one horizontal pattern.
<br><br>Inadvertently look to think ordinary, when the white shallow a careful look at the time, the pupils suddenly shrink.
<br><br>She could clearly feel that the statue contained a powerful force.
<br><br>"It's really unexpected that this little mortal store actually hides such a good thing."
<br><br>She approached and carefully surveyed it.
<br><br>And outside the small store, the two father and daughter of Night Energy, who were hidden in the shadows, revealed a strong gloomy look.
<br><br>"Father, how did this Bai Shanyi suddenly come to Little Dance girl's house." Night Yi gaze said.
<br><br>"It should be attracted by Little Dance girl's painting and statue." Night Neng guessed: "But sir is really heavenly and unpredictable, I'm afraid that he had already counted that this Bai Shallow One would come, and only then deliberately explained that we came to Baier City."
<br><br>"Then we?"
<br><br>Night Yi looked at Night Neng.
<br><br>"On, absolutely can't let Bai Asaichi get his way."
<br><br>Night Neng's face flashed with anger and said in a deep voice: "Sir's things also dare to take, really ate the bear's heart and leopard's guts."
<br><br>"But can we stop Bai Shanyi?" Night Yi couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Don't worry, since sir called us to come, he definitely won't be aimless, much less call us to send us to our death." Night Energy said with firm eyes.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Night Yi nodded her head equally solemnly.
<br><br>The two turned into two streams of light and flickered towards the small store.
<br><br>"What are these two father and daughter doing?"
<br><br>"Could it be that they think that when they reach the Earth Immortal, they are the rivals of Bai Shao Yi?"
<br><br>"It can't be that they are tired of living and running to send death, right?"
<br><br>And in the dark, seeing the two father and daughter of Night Energy rushing towards the small store without hesitation, the four patriarchs couldn't help but cry out in alarm.
<br><br>"Stop."
<br><br>"Put down what you're holding."
<br><br>The night can two people came to the door of the small store, rushed to the white shallow one to send out a scolding voice.
<br><br>And while scolding, the two hurriedly winked at Xiaodai's parents.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two couples hurriedly fled out of the backyard in panic.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>For the couple's departure, Bai Shouyi did not care, but slowly put down the statue in his hand, and inclined his head to look at the two Night Energy people with a faint look of surprise.
<br><br>"Not only did you pull out my Soul Suppressing Nail, but you also let the two of you losers break through to Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"That's a bit surprising."
<br><br>She raised the corner of her mouth and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Hmph, you don't have to put on this high and mighty posture, warning you, you hurry up and put down what you're holding." Night Energy said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Put down?"
<br><br>Bai Shanyi's body was cold, when the voice fell, it was already in front of Night Energy, the cold palm was already pinching Night Energy's neck.
<br><br>"Since when did a small Earth Immortal dare to shout in front of us?"
<br><br>Bai Shangyi transmitted a one-word voice, while also slowly exerting force, grasping Night Energy's neck with a crunching sound.
<br><br>Night can withstand the great pain, the face rose red, but still red eyes to transmit a hoarse voice: "This is the sir's things, without the sir's consent if you dare to move, you can not afford the sir's anger."
<br><br>"Giggle ......"
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi sneered grimly.
<br><br>"I white shallow one need things, there is not yet can not get, and no one can stop, let alone just you two small earth immortals, even if your so-called sir personally came, in front of me also only obediently kneel down."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Night energy full of hatred stared at white shallow one, angry body trembling.
<br><br>"I would love for your so-called gentleman to come to me."
<br><br>Bai Shallow One said again icily, "After all, I don't have time to find him a shrinking turtle, so I was wondering if he would come to me if I killed you two?"
<br><br>"Hmph, sir if he strikes, you won't even have a chance to fight back." Night Energy said word for word.
<br><br>"Fine, fine."
<br><br>"Then I'm looking forward to him coming to me even more."
<br><br>"But you two, just go to hell first!"
<br><br>With a single movement of his hands, Bai Shangyi grabbed one person's neck with one hand and directly lifted the two up.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>In front of Bai Shanyi's methods, even if the two had broken through to Earth Immortal, they still had no power to fight back.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The two people were like chickens, their faces turned red, and their legs struggled frantically.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>"Watch them die?"
<br><br>"Should we make a move?"
<br><br>From afar, the four patriarchs who were secretly observing this scene, looking at the two Night Energy who were about to die, emitted anxious voices.
<br><br>But having said that, the four did not make a move.
<br><br>Because they can not play a role first, night can two Earth Immortals in front of the white shallow one still do not have the power to fight back can be seen, they still underestimate the white shallow one.
<br><br>In this way.
<br><br>They dare not stand in line easily.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>However, just at this moment, a loud sound erupted inside the grocery store.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>A powerful aura rushed up to the sky.
<br><br>And was preparing to crush the night can two people white shallow as soon as they felt the breath behind them, but also the face changed.
<br><br>Looking back, he found that the breath was coming from the statue behind him.
