Since the late barrel passed, half a month passed, Yi Feng still did not encounter an ordinary qualification.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng spit, he really overestimated this foreign world, but did not think that most people are waste.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Continue to be a salted fish!"
<br><br>Seeing that he could not complete the system's task for a while, Yi Feng had to return to the salted fish state, nothing to play carving, dancing square dance to exercise the body.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>Just then, the familiar voice came out again in the mind.
<br><br>"Detected that the host created the sect for half a month, still did not receive the standard disciples, hereby prepared ten flyers for the host."
<br><br>"Please ask the host whether to receive them?"
<br><br>"Leaflets?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had regained his salty state, sat up from his chair with one hip and hurriedly shouted, "Receive." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>And in the next instant when Yi Feng's voice came out, ten golden flyers fell into Yi Feng's hands.
<br><br>"Is it still bothered by the fact that you can't find a double practice?"
<br><br>"Is it because there are too few handsome girls who like you?"
<br><br>"Recruiting la recruiting la, heaven and earth door recruiting la!"
<br><br>"To ask which god is cultivating immortality, Nansha Pingjiang Tiandi Gate."
<br><br>"Here to be able to redisplay the male masculinity, female femininity, on the peak of life is not a dream, not a dream ......"
<br><br>Looking at the advertising words on it, Yi Feng frowned, this typography, this style of painting, proper alley sense of both ah.
<br><br>This motherfucker can recruit people?
<br><br>But right now there is no way for Yi Feng, only to dead horse as a living horse.
<br><br>"So, how should this flyer be used?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"All it takes is for the host to hold the flyer and move it with the intention of the mind, and the flyer will be able to be sent out randomly and fall into the hands of someone who meets the host's conditions." A voice came from the system.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"It's quite amazing ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes flickered slightly and he was busy asking, "Then the people who receive the flyers will definitely come to me to worship?"
<br><br>"As you wish."
<br><br>Once again, the system once again emitted a voice that was hated.
<br><br>Yi Feng was speechless.
<br><br>But right now there is no way out, pick up a flyer mentally.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The flyer in his hand turned into a star in the air, and then disappeared, not long, ten flyers were sent out by Yi Feng.
<br><br>And Yi Feng just ready to lie down when the ground suddenly came a heavy pace.
<br><br>When he opened his eyes, he saw Chi Yat Bucket carrying a large bowl, crotch moving those elephant legs, flying towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Master, master, I've realized."
<br><br>While running, Chi Yat Bucket shouted excitedly.
<br><br>"What have you enlightened?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him with a dumbfounded face and asked in bewilderment.
<br><br>"Master, I managed to enlighten the way to make fried rice through the Recipe Book you gave me, and I gave it a go."
<br><br>Chiyi Bucket wiped the sweat on his forehead and shouted with an excited face, while bringing a bowl of golden fried rice in his hand to Yi Feng's front.
<br><br>And it so happened that Wu Chang'an, who had been fiddling with the talisman paper all day, walked by and was startled when he saw the bowl of fried rice.
<br><br>"Good guy, this fatty can ah, even Yangzhou fried rice out, it also contains the power of the great dao, cattle ah!"
<br><br>But Yi Feng mouth could not help but twitch.
<br><br>This guy, not just fried a rice, to be so excited?
<br><br>As expected of a foodie ah!
<br><br>But looking at the fatty's excited look, Yi Feng couldn't bear to blow, after praising a sentence, he continued: "The Complete Book of Recipes" there are still many things worthy of your understanding, fried rice is only the beginning, continue to understand!
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Chi a bucket of excited obeisance, set aside the bowl of mockery, and left respectfully.
<br><br>"It seems to be quite fragrant?"
<br><br>Yi Feng moved his nose, sat up and patted his belly, then he picked up the fried rice and tasted it.
<br><br>"This fatty, fried rice tastes pretty good, ah, in the future to eat midnight snacks do not worry about no one to do."
<br><br>"This disciple, not for nothing ......"
<br><br>......
<br><br>The last two days a bit of card text sorry brothers, of course, write the old routine is actually very easy for me, after all, the old author, just their own reluctance to write then, plus these two days just turn point, especially important to understand, of course, there will be updates in the evening.
