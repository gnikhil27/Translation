The voice is getting closer and closer, and more and more pleasant to the ear.
<br><br>It also made Yi Feng, who felt more and more familiar with this voice, involuntarily stood up and looked at the door.
<br><br>Along with this constant sound, Lu Qingshan brought Mor Sihan finally arrived in front of Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>"Crap!"
<br><br>Looking at Mor Sihan, Yi Feng's mouth couldn't help but exclaim, his eyes looked straight at Mor Sihan, his eyes were about to burst out.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>He finally knew what Lu Qingshan said Strange Sihan's strange costume was.
<br><br>Also finally figured out what this giggling giggling sound is ......
<br><br>Because at this moment, the Strange Sihan, wearing a red dress wrapped hip.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>It is the dress wrap dress that Yi Feng had only in his previous life. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>And the voice that made him familiar was because Mor Sihan's feet were stepping on a pair of high heels.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Directly let Yi Feng look dumbfounded, up and down back and forth to look at Mor Sihan.
<br><br>Fragrant shoulders exposed, good-looking collarbone full of sex G, in addition to her tall figure, in the tight package hip skirt with, her simmering figure will be shown to the fullest, the convex convex the warp, showing the goddess temperament.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Let Yi Feng look dumbfounded is not because of the Morsihan good-looking.
<br><br>Rather, because the impact of this dress brought him is too big, so that his palms can not help but slightly tremble.
<br><br>It can be said that this dress he is twenty years, a full twenty years have not seen.
<br><br>Almost instantly, it pulled Yi Feng back to the endless memories.
<br><br>"Won't you invite me to have a seat?"
<br><br>Suddenly, Mor Sihan smiled gently and a nice voice came out.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly pulled a stool towards Morsihan.
<br><br>And Lu Qingshan on the side also had the sense to back off.
<br><br>Looking at the sitting Strange Si Han, Yi Feng still did not leave her dress, wiped his eyes, and even secretly pinched himself, afraid that what he saw all this is an illusion.
<br><br>"I know you have a lot of questions to ask me."
<br><br>Morsihan was not polite, her jade hand lifted the teapot on the table and took the initiative to pour tea for the two of them, while slowly saying, "But I am not what you think."
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"It means what you think."
<br><br>Struthers Han looked at Yi Feng and passed out a serious voice.
<br><br>"Then why do you ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Struthers Han's dress.
<br><br>"This is a very long story, but I am by no means the ...... travellers you are talking about." Struthers Han said meaningfully.
<br><br>For some reason, the word "travellers" was bitten extra hard by Morsihan.
<br><br>"Then you have seen the travellers?" Yi Feng was busy asking.
<br><br>Struthers Han smiled and did not answer.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned tightly, and the person calmed down a lot.
<br><br>Since this woman was able to wear this costume and say the words travellers, it meant that she was not a travellers, or at least close to travellers.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Yi Feng can be sure that this Immortal River continent must be more than just him a traveler.
<br><br>In addition, he always felt that this woman came to him today with another purpose.
<br><br>"Actually, I came today because ......"
<br><br>Mor Sihan seemed to see through Yi Feng's mind, lowered her head and pondered slightly, after a long silence, raised her head and looked at Yi Feng seriously and said, "Because I miss you a lot ......"
<br><br>"You miss me a lot?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was immediately confused.
<br><br>Heart can not help but spit, girl you know me, you want me?
<br><br>"And let me remind you."
<br><br>Morsihan said again.
<br><br>"Remind me of what?" Yi Feng looked up and asked.
<br><br>"Today, the fifth day of April." Struthers Han said.
<br><br>"I know it's the fifth day of April, but what are you trying to express?" Yi Feng asked in wonder.
<br><br>Morsihan smiled, her tall figure stood up, her jade hand held the stool stepping on high heels and came to Yi Feng's side.
<br><br>Along with a fragrance came, in a trance, Mor Sihan suddenly came closer.
<br><br>Red lips slightly pressed on Yi Feng's cheek, a gentle kiss.
<br><br>"Be sure to take good care of yourself, I'll wait for you ......"
<br><br>After a soft admonition, she stroked her hair and walked to the door like nothing was happening, then turned around and said, "Well, I've seen you and your arrangement is done, I, too, should leave."
<br><br>After saying that, she smiled gently, and finally gave Yi Feng a serious look, Mor Sihan pushed the door and left.
<br><br>Looking at the leaving Mor Sihan, Yi Feng did not know if it was an illusion, that last look, was it reluctance?
<br><br>Reacting to the Yi Feng hurriedly pushed the door to catch up.
<br><br>After all, he now has too many doubts, was somehow a kiss not to say, Mor Sihan words is to say that he a head two big, he must ask clearly how it is a matter.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When a few moments later Yi Feng chased up, but there was no trace of Morsihan, chased to the lake shore also did not catch up.
<br><br>"Walking so fast?"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but shake his head.
<br><br>This night.
<br><br>Yi Feng â‘  sleepless night.
<br><br>Today, the fifth day of April?
<br><br>Take care of yourself?
<br><br>Missed him and gave him a kiss on the cheek?
<br><br>From time to time, the words of Mor Sihan to him popped up in his mind, as well as her inexplicable actions.
<br><br>Wait a minute.
<br><br>The fifth day of April?
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly sat up from the bed, eyes wide open.
<br><br>Because he suddenly remembered that the day he crossed over, it was the fifth day of April.
<br><br>And today, it's exactly twenty years since he crossed over!
<br><br>So, what does this mean?
<br><br>Is it a coincidence? Or was it intentional?
<br><br>This is very thought-provoking.
<br><br>Just at dawn, the sky is still playing gray, Yi Feng rode slowly out.
<br><br>He wanted to find Mor Sihan.
<br><br>For all these questions, Yi Feng must find Mor Sihan to ask a clear.
<br><br>After arriving at Pingjiang City, Yi Feng directly asked people inside the city about the whereabouts of Mor Sihan.
<br><br>He thought it would be easy to inquire about her whereabouts, but the result was beyond Yi Feng's expectation.
<br><br>"Niu Da Ma, are you really not mistaken?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>"Oh, sir, what am I lying to you for, we really don't have any flower girl in Pingjiang City!" Niu Da Ma said bitterly, seemingly afraid that Yi Feng did not believe, directly launched a poisonous oath on the spot.
<br><br>After not getting the result here, Yi Feng asked a lot of acquaintances, but got the same result ......
<br><br>There is no flower girl in Pingjiang City, and there is no such person as Mor Sihan.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng directly doubt life!
<br><br>The flower leader Mor Sihan he often heard in Pingjiang City, and even inquired about these people heard, but now they all collectively said no this person?
<br><br>Is it possible that Mor Sihan did not want to find her and paid off these people?
<br><br>With such doubts, Yi Feng returned directly to the island and found Lu Qingshan and those workers who ate that day.
<br><br>These people have been on the island, and the meal that day have seen Mor Sihan, it is impossible not to know, and more unlikely to be bribed, right?
<br><br>"Old man, you should know where she lives, right?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Sir, there really isn't such a person, when did a flower girl appear in our Pingjiang City?" Lu Qingshan patiently explained.
<br><br>"Yes sir, there really isn't any Strange Sihan."
<br><br>"Yeah, I've never even heard of it!"
<br><br>Other people also came out with such voices.
<br><br>"Not you guys, you don't fool me!" Yi Feng said with a cold face: "That day dinner that play the piano flower girl, you guys do not know?"
<br><br>"Sir, we do not dare!"
<br><br>The crowd saw Yi Feng cold face, have a shiver of fear, and hurriedly bowed down.
<br><br>"Do not dare then still do not hurry to say?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted coldly.
<br><br>"Sir, not we do not say, is really no such person ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, there was no woman playing the piano at the dinner that day, it was you who was playing the piano for us!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we really did not lie."
<br><br>Under Yi Feng's anger, various solemn and even oath-bearing voices came from the crowd, and with anxious faces, they scrambled to explain towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Looking at their faces and voices, Yi Feng was instantly flustered.
<br><br>One will look at Lu Qingshan, and asked again in a deep voice: "Old man, the woman who came to see me yesterday, you always know, right, just that one dressed strangely!"
<br><br>"Sir, there is no woman to see you ah?" Lu Qingshan said with a difficult look on his face.
<br><br>"You didn't lie to me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked solemnly.
<br><br>"Really no ah!" Lu Qingshan said busily.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but take a step backwards on his paws.
<br><br>This was too bizarre.
<br><br>All say there is no this person, even Lu Qingshan who brought her here yesterday also has no memory of this woman, then he saw the woman yesterday who is?
<br><br>Is it a ghost?
