Jiang to this period of time has not been able to calm.
<br><br>How can not figure out why a mere human immortal can easily manage the fish, how to bite the others.
<br><br>In this puzzled emotions, Jiang to spend many days in the dark shadow island.
<br><br>Originally thought that the fish in the sea can use, using the mortal approach to live, but since that day, she will seaside are afraid to approach.
<br><br>In order to survive, shall not mobilize immortal elements to stay alive.
<br><br>Just in this way, she was not only slowly backfired by the raging power of this dark shadow island, but also because of the incorruptibility day by day weakness.
<br><br>For a long period of time, her face was hungry and yellow, her lips were dry and cracked, and she was walking shakily on the Shadow Island.
<br><br>She knew that if she walked in this state in the flat sand, she would be eaten by the ferocious vultures on the island.
<br><br>So you can only walk around the Gobi shrubs into the forest.
<br><br>Once in the woods, Jiang Zhi was stunned.
<br><br>She looked at the dark shadow wolf corpses all over the forest ...... and stared incredulously ...... One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The previous ones were just three wolves, but now, it was a forest full of Shadow Wolf corpses that could not be counted!
<br><br>How powerful a person should be to do this?
<br><br>Did a terrifying to the extreme existence really appear on the island?
<br><br>Jiang Zhi, amidst her uncertainty, cautiously approached the wolf's corpse.
<br><br>She gulped, picked up the entrails that were discarded aside, blew on them, and lit a fire in the forest ......
<br><br>Jiang Zhi, who had eaten and drunk enough, sat alone in the forest and thought about it.
<br><br>She intended to go to that day the human immortal.
<br><br>Was planning to ask in person, how he was bitten by those fish still unharmed.
<br><br>After the decision, Jiang Zhi did not hesitate to set out.
<br><br>Soon after walking out of the forest, Jiang Zhi stopped in front of a corpse.
<br><br>The vultures above were driven away by her.
<br><br>She looked at the corpse in front of her with a cold face.
<br><br>A wolf skin was half-covered next to the corpse.
<br><br>The corpse had been eaten by the vultures and only the bones were left.
<br><br>Next to the white bones, the shiny wolf skin was especially conspicuous.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi squatted down and picked up the wolf skin to seriously check it out.
<br><br>"This wolf skin ......"
<br><br>She muttered to herself, and after being surprised, her gaze gradually calmed down, "It's indeed his head wolf skin."
<br><br>Saying that, Jiang Zhi sighed helplessly, "Sure enough, it's still dead."
<br><br>She laughed bitterly, she still thought he was safe and sound, but it turned out that she had overestimated him.
<br><br>It is also true that in this Shadow Island, a mere human immortal can live that long, it is already very good.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was slightly disappointed, she spread the wolf skin, picked up the white bones one by one, put them into the wolf skin and wrapped them, then found a large stone leeward and buried them.
<br><br>"This Shadow Island, this is where you belong." She whispered to the place where the bones were buried, randomly transported here, it is also your life, rest in peace."
<br><br>After saying that, she closed her eyes.
<br><br>Suddenly, the sound of rolling roars came, and Jiang Zhi was startled.
<br><br>She hurriedly walked out and looked in the direction where the roaring sound came from.
<br><br>In a moment, she snapped awake.
<br><br>The sound was coming from the direction of the Black Sea!
<br><br>It was the sound of the Black Sea's roar!
<br><br>Not just a roar, but a roar of awakening!
<br><br>Jiang Zhi thought of the ancient books she had read before coming to Shadow Island.
<br><br>At the bottom of the black sea of Shadow Island, there is a giant demon named Demon Drought, shaped like a giant python, with four wings and six legs, sleeping under the sea.
<br><br>After waking up, it can swallow the sky and cover the sun.
<br><br>This demon will wake up once every thousand years. When it awakens, it will devour the essence of all living beings on the whole island.
<br><br>A roar shook the sky, with the sound of tsunami waves.
<br><br>Jiang to retreat, terrified face white with fear.
<br><br>It's over.
<br><br>It's the demon drought ......
<br><br>It's a disaster!
<br><br>How did it happen to meet the Devil Demon awakening!
<br><br>When the demon drought awakens, she, as a living being on the island, has no chance of dying. In an instant, she would be sucked up and turned into a dry bone.
<br><br>It's funny, she was just lamenting for others to become dry bones.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Above the black sea, the sticky black water surged, like the thick liquid of poison, giving people a sense of flat fear.
<br><br>Black waves rolled up, a thousand feet high.
<br><br>As the waves rise and fall, a giant green and black shadow in the sea surface appears.
<br><br>The evil scales glowing in the sea with a green light.
<br><br>Suddenly, the devil's body scurried out of the sea, leaping out along the ten-thousand-foot waves, a flight to the sky, blood-red eyes flowing with secretions, everywhere they went was corroded.
<br><br>A time to swallow the sky and cover the sun.
<br><br>At the same time, a toad sleeping in the sea, was a huge wave knocked over.
<br><br>The white belly was revealed.
<br><br>"Quack ......"
<br><br>The toad rolled over, extremely dissatisfied with its good dream being disturbed.
<br><br>It looked around.
<br><br>Its eyes fell on the huge black shadow rushing up into the sky.
<br><br>"Croak!"
<br><br>It swam over with both legs in stirrups, picking and pulling.
