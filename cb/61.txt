After long time.
<br><br>Only then did the flames of anger on Ning Xuanwu's body dissipate quite a bit.
<br><br>"Master, please calm your anger." Seeing this, Demon Ling'er came out at the right time and said, "But now at this time, it is indeed necessary to make a plan for the next, Master, what do you think?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's face was gloomy, but he also had to make plans for the future.
<br><br>Thinking about this, he raised his head to look at the demon Ling'er, said softly: "Ling'er, today is the most failed day in the history of my Xuanwu Sect, so the future of the Xuanwu Sect, but also rely on you ah!"
<br><br>"Rely on me?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er opened her astonished red lips.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu nodded heavily, helplessly glanced in the direction of the martial arts school, although he had a resigned heart, but in the face of such a supreme expert, he did not even have the courage to take revenge.
<br><br>Seeing Ning Xuanwu like this, demon Ling'er heart is not a taste, can not help but ask: "Master, that martial arts hall in the end what, actually will ......"
<br><br>Hearing that, Ning Xuanwu mouth corner twitched, sighed, then said with a palpitating heart: "Four Martial Sects, a Martial Saint or even a Martial Emperor!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Despite the speculation that the people of the martial school would be very strong, but when Ning Xuanwu told the truth, the crowd couldn't help but draw a breath backwards.
<br><br>This tiny martial school actually had four Martial Sects, and a Martial Saint or even a Martial Emperor?
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder as strong as Ning Xuanwu, but also so miserable ......
<br><br>"So ......?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er frowned at Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"That's why I want you to stay in Pingjiang City." Ning Xuanwu tightened his pupils and said, "The roots of my Xuanwu Sect are on this side, and although there has been friction with the Qingshan Sect for thousands of years, both sides have at least managed to maintain a balance."
<br><br>"But now, this equilibrium has broken."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ning Xuanwu's face showed deep concern, and then said viciously, "This old pickpocket, Lu Qingshan, doesn't know what kind of schemes and tricks he used to hook up with that youth from this martial arts school, and also obtained a supreme divine sword."
<br><br>"Imagine, in case Lu Qingshan gets something good from these masters again, will Lu Qingshan, who is on par with us, still let us go?"
<br><br>"And if he gets the benefit of an expert, will we still be a match?"
<br><br>It had to be said that although Ning Xuanwu had an explosive temper, as the head of a family, he usually thought about long-term issues.
<br><br>And when the crowd heard the words, they immediately understood the pros and cons of the relationship.
<br><br>Face.
<br><br>Exuded a strong look of gloom.
<br><br>"So Master is asking for me?" Demon Ling'er asked nervously.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu sighed and said with an ugly face, "The Earthquake Stone and Swift Cloak cannot be retrieved, and it is impossible to take this revenge today, although I cannot swallow this anger, but in front of absolute strength, there is nothing we can do."
<br><br>"Instead, we have to try our best to please and get close to that youth, at least to do the same, as Lu Qingshan."
<br><br>"Master, I can understand what you mean by that." Demon Ling'er said worriedly, "But ...... before the two heartless brothers first, but just today's incident, the two sides have already formed a beam, how are we supposed to please and get close to him?"
<br><br>"So, this is the reason I want you to stay, although you met with him last time, but that was after your disguise, he has not seen your real appearance ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ning Xuanwu took a deep breath, solemn gaze looked at the demon Ling'er, the voice came out of his mouth word by word.
<br><br>"Therefore ......"
<br><br>"I want you to do everything you can to seduce him and become his woman!"
