These words.
<br><br>Let the dozens of people in the hall filled with anger, killing intent in their eyes.
<br><br>However, they did not dare to act rashly until they were instructed by Yi Feng.
<br><br>After all, they did not forget their own identity, in front of Yi Feng is only a mortal.
<br><br>So for a time, the dozens of people in the hall, have looked at Yi Feng, full of questions.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng immediately gave the crowd a white glance and drank: "What are you looking at me for, you injured our people and are still so arrogant, just give Laozi a beating!"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the crowd's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>They were waiting for these words from Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, a bunch of ants, thinking that because there are so many people, they can be subordinate?"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the green clothed man at the head immediately emitted a disdainful voice and laughed rampantly.
<br><br>But while he was still holding his head high, his companion next to him pulled the corner of his coat while swallowing and sputtering, "Quick, look at ...... look at them." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Look at what look?"
<br><br>He said inexplicably, only then lowered his head and redirected his gaze toward the crowd in the hall.
<br><br>This look.
<br><br>His legs went subconsciously soft, his body shivered, and a horrified voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>"How can it be?"
<br><br>At this moment, he saw that a faint aura rose collectively from the large dozens of people in the hall, and an unparalleled pressure invaded towards them.
<br><br>"Ka ......"
<br><br>"Martial ...... martial martial, martial emperor, all of them are martial emperors, six lives, seven lives, nine lives, ten lives, and even more terrifying ......"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>For a time, the six green-clothed people completely without the arrogance of just now, one of the legs shivered, the inside of the throat is like a click of fish thorns, the speech also became stuttered.
<br><br>You know, this kind of situation, but they have never seen in their lives.
<br><br>Why would so many Martial Emperors gather here?
<br><br>They really can't figure it out.
<br><br>This was like stirring up a hornet's nest.
<br><br>"Run."
<br><br>I don't know which green-clothed person shouted, and the six figures drew their legs and ran, instantly sweeping into the sky.
<br><br>The dozens of Martial Emperors in the hall also followed instantly, and in the blink of an eye, they turned into dozens of streams of light in the sky of Pingjiang City and chased after them.
<br><br>And at this moment, Yi Feng, long ago took the man who was just injured to the side of the room, did not pay attention to their fight, because his mind was on this man's injuries.
<br><br>Damn, is this a work injury or not?
<br><br>This in case the fight is really serious, he, as the boss, how much money to pay ah.
<br><br>"How are you?" Yi Feng asked softly.
<br><br>"I, I'm fine."
<br><br>The young man faced Yi Feng alone and was extremely nervous.
<br><br>"Come let me take a look."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly checked the young man's injuries, and after some examination, he breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately, it was not particularly serious.
<br><br>But it is estimated to spend a lot of medical expenses, which I'm afraid he has to post the medical expenses.
<br><br>Out of the door, looking at the wrecked hall and the destruction of tables, chairs and dishes, Yi Feng frowned more deeply.
<br><br>It seems that not only the medical expenses ah.
<br><br>Yi Feng anxious, a while ago lost a few hundred gold coins, this is estimated to use a few dozen ......
<br><br>No way ah.
<br><br>The injustice has a head and the debt has a master, I can not be the big head ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng shouted towards Lu Qingshan next to him, "Older brother, go and tell them to catch the live ones."
<br><br>"Good, good."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan hastily responded, he was already blaming himself because of his lower cultivation level to keep up, now it finally worked a little, he also hastily ran out the door, and then flew up into the sky.
<br><br>"Remember, sir said to catch the live ones."
<br><br>He shouted loudly by voice transmission.
<br><br>The whole Pingjiang City echoed with his voice.
<br><br>"This old man has a loud voice." Yi Feng, who continued to help the young man maintain his injuries, pulled out his ears and couldn't help but spit out.
<br><br>"Sir said to capture the live one."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>"Catch the live one."
<br><br>And the rest of the people also got the message instantly, nodded their heads and went after those six people.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>The whole Pingjiang City whistled loudly, and the rolling pressure swept through the entire sky.
<br><br>But what makes people feel puzzled is that, in the face of the movement in the sky of Pingjiang City, the entire population of Pingjiang City, actually did not cause half a stir.
<br><br>The vegetable sellers sell vegetables.
<br><br>The chess player plays chess.
<br><br>The lady of the Yixing Yuan continues to yell and solicit customers ......
<br><br>"Quick, hurry up and sacrifice the walking boat given by Lord Duan."
<br><br>The six green-clothed people looked behind them to chase the crazy large dozens of Martial Emperors, suddenly their scalps tingled, panicked and sent out a voice.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>The leader of the green clothed man palm, as the light flashed, a flying boat instantly sacrificed, six people boarded the flying boat immediately play out countless times faster than before.
<br><br>Also in an instant, they left behind dozens of Martial Emperors behind them.
<br><br>"Haha, Lord Duan is really powerful, just giving us the flying boat to come out to complete the mission is so good."
<br><br>"Yes, this speed, I'm afraid it's comparable to the Earth Immortals of the Heavenly Realm."
<br><br>"In short, in this Immortal River Continent, I'm afraid no one will be able to catch up with us."
<br><br>"If we follow Lord Duan, sooner or later the Immortal River Continent will be controlled in our hands."
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>After boarding the flying boat, the six people became emboldened and laughed arrogantly.
<br><br>"You guys come after us instead, I'd like to see how you can catch up with us?"
<br><br>Seeing that the flying boat had already flown away from Pingjiang City, they couldn't help but send out provocative voices towards the dozens of Martial Emperors behind them.
<br><br>After all, with the flying boat in place, no one in the entire Immortal River Continent could catch up with them, so they naturally possessed the confidence of not being afraid.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as their voices fell, more than 300 heavenly auras suddenly exploded out from the east, south and north of Pingjiang City, the middle and west of the city, and other directions.
<br><br>This breath came together.
<br><br>The wind rose in the sky over the entire Pingjiang City, and the temperature suddenly changed.
<br><br>"You six trash, I'm afraid you're thinking too much."
<br><br>These three hundred or so breaths instantly rose into the sky, and almost in the blink of an eye, they caught up with the flying boat.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>The six green-robed men were dumbfounded!
<br><br>The previous sixty or so Martial Emperors were scary enough, but this sudden appearance of more than three hundred, what the hell is this?
<br><br>And they caught up with the flying boat in the blink of an eye?
<br><br>"Boom boom boom boom ......"
<br><br>More than three hundred slap marks coalesced from mid-air and slapped towards their ark.
<br><br>"Mummy, I was wrong!"
<br><br>The green-clad man who was just arrogant to the core suddenly came out with a ghostly cry.
