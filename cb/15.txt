"Ying'er!"
<br><br>Seeing this woman, Yi Feng's eyes lit up, the young girl in front of him was no other than his childhood friend Peng Ying, the two hadn't seen each other for several months.
<br><br>"Mmm!"
<br><br>Peng Ying nodded her head.
<br><br>"Go, sit inside." Yi Feng took her jade hand and said with a smile.
<br><br>"Forget it." Peng Ying broke away from Yi Feng's arm, her mouth wanted to say something, and only after a long time did she say, "No more sitting, I just came to take a look, by the way, to tell you the good news, I have successfully entered the Green Mountain Sect and become an outer disciple."
<br><br>"Is that so, then congratulations." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>But he had some complications in his heart.
<br><br>On the one hand, he was happy for Peng Ying.
<br><br>On the one hand, out of selfishness he didn't want Peng Ying to cultivate, after all, it meant that the two might not see each other for a long time.
<br><br>"I know, you don't want me to cultivate." Peng Ying sighed with emotion and said, "But it is my dream to be able to join the Castle Peak Sect to cultivate, and you should be happy for me that I can successfully join the Castle Peak Sect." 
<br><br>Yi Feng had a bitter smile on his face.
<br><br>He sighed.
<br><br>But it was true, each had their own path, he really should support Peng Ying's dream.
<br><br>"It's good that you accept it." After a moment of contemplation, Peng Ying added, "I'll go first, I'm afraid I won't come back to you later."
<br><br>After saying that, she walked towards the door.
<br><br>Yi Feng wanted to speak but did not know how, but also understood what Peng Ying said, since she began to cultivate, it means that the two are no longer the same.
<br><br>But the two lives, Yi Feng is also relieved, after all, each has its own pursuit.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng caught up with Peng Ying and shouted, "I wish you well, just uncle and aunt ......"
<br><br>"They I will take good care of." Peng Ying said with a slight sigh.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, his parents do not know where he grew up, Peng Ying's parents treat him extremely well, thinking of this, he held out the kitchen knife in his hand and said, "I also have nothing to send, remember last time aunt said, let me have time to help him beat a kitchen knife, help me bring them it!"
<br><br>Looking at the kitchen knife in Yi Feng's hand, Peng Ying frowned slightly, his expression was incomplete.
<br><br>"Ying'er, is it ready yet, have to go back to the clan."
<br><br>At this time, a white-robed youth walked next to him, holding a long sword in his hand, and gently asked towards Peng Ying.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Jie, wait for me, it will be ready soon, by the way, this is my friend Yi Feng." Peng Ying said softly.
<br><br>"Good, then you hurry up." The youth said in a soft voice, as for Yi Feng he didn't even look at him, after all, it was just a mortal, not worthy of his greeting.
<br><br>"He is?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Peng Ying looked complicated and sighed before saying, "I hope you won't blame me, you know I have only average qualifications, it's all because of his help that I was able to enter the Castle Peak Sect, I can't be negative to him."
<br><br>"As for this knife, you can keep it for yourself!"
<br><br>After saying that, Peng Ying quickly followed the white-robed youth and disappeared in Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>Peng Ying's words echoed in Yi Feng's ears.
<br><br>Can not be negative, but what about him, Yi Feng, what is it?
<br><br>It's really ironic!
<br><br>"Grass!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed.
<br><br>"Do not pull down."
<br><br>Put away the kitchen knife and put it in the kitchen.
<br><br>"Disciple, watch the store."
<br><br>After giving an explanation, Yi Feng leaned back to the recliner, two glasses of wine went down, and whooped and hollered.
<br><br>Green Mountain Sect main hall.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain was sitting at the top with a majestic face, and at the bottom, besides Luo Lanxue and others, were the elders of the Green Mountain Sect, while the personal disciples of the elders were also standing behind them.
<br><br>This kind of elite from the top to the bottom of the entire Castle Peak Sect sitting together, it is rare.
<br><br>The entire hall was filled with a heavy concentration of colors.
<br><br>The duel between Old Man Qingshan and Old Man Xuanwu would not be suspended because of Old Man Qingshan's breakthrough.
<br><br>Originally, I thought that after the breakthrough of the Martial King's realm, there was no suspense about the duel, but just now, I got the exact news that the Xuanwu Ancestor had broken through the Martial King's realm ten years ago.
<br><br>This news made the mood of the people of the Castle Peak Sect, like a roller coaster ride.
<br><br>One is just entered the Martial King's realm of the Qingshan old ancestor, one is into the Martial King ten years old Xuanwu old ancestor, which is stronger or weaker, it is clear to see.
<br><br>"Let's all brainstorm and come up with ideas!" Under the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, Zhu Yun, the Sect Master of Castle Peak Sect, said in a deep voice.
<br><br>The hall was silent.
<br><br>In front of absolute strength, all scheming was vain.
<br><br>Could it be that the Castle Peak Sect was really going to the end of the road because of this?
<br><br>Just then, a white-robed youth clutching a sword walked out, he was the personal disciple of one of the elders, if Yi Feng was here, it was the same one who appeared with Peng Ying before.
