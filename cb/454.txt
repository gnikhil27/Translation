Also at the same time when Wu Chang'an was lying down, Lu Zhengyi's palm print was already reaching the top of his head.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"Still pretending to be a god!"
<br><br>"Die."
<br><br>This careless stance of Wu Chang'an made Lu Zhengyi burn with anger, but when he remembered that Wu Chang'an would soon die under his palm, he gushed out a thick cold smile.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>The cold smile on his face froze abruptly.
<br><br>Because he suddenly found that a monkey appeared next to him at some point.
<br><br>He thunderbolt mouth, full of hair, holding an iron stick stick in his hand.
<br><br>This sudden appearance of the figure, almost Lu Zhengyi scared piss, while in this monkey's body, felt a great crisis.
<br><br>He also counted on the moment of truth, hastily withdrew the attack in his hands, rolled towards the back. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Also in the next moment when he rolled out, that thunder mouth a loud cry.
<br><br>"Tally, eat my old Sun a stick!"
<br><br>The voice just fell, a big stick through the sky in his previous standing place, draw down.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>This stick, directly pumped the ground out of a large canyon, the depth of the bottomless, the entire Baier City rumbled, as if sending an earthquake.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi did not eat this stick, but was lifted out by the airflow carried by this stick.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This stick stunned everyone present.
<br><br>Especially the crowd of Bai Yang True Palace stared with eyes full of incredulity.
<br><br>This mere airflow had lifted Lu Zhengyi off, if this stick actually landed on Lu Zhengyi's head, what would be the consequence?
<br><br>Think of all feel scared.
<br><br>And Lu Zhengyi himself is also a chill down his back, a face with palpitations.
<br><br>He stepped on the void and flew back again, narrowed his eyes and stared deadly at the thunder god's mouth, then said coldly towards Wu Chang'an: "I didn't expect that there was actually such a powerful wooden sculpture hidden inside this group of rags."
<br><br>"But so what?"
<br><br>"Do you really think that I, Baiyang True Palace, can't do anything about it?"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Lu Zhengyi let out a cold laugh and waved his hand and bellowed.
<br><br>"Although this wooden sculpture is strong, it is only expendable and there is only one, all of you listen to my order, follow me and destroy it first."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>All the experts of Baiyang True Palace answered in unison, their Qi was noisy and they all swept down from the sky.
<br><br>At the same time as they flew down, all of them unleashed their means, and dozens of Heavenly Immortal experts attacked that Thunderbolt monkey from all directions.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"How can a wooden sculpture stop the experts of my Baiyang True Palace?"
<br><br>"I vow to capture you and after a good torture, throw you into the Cave of Ten Thousand Ghosts and never be allowed to live again."
<br><br>On top of the flying boat, Bai Shanyi, who was watching the show, raised his lips and revealed a hateful smile.
<br><br>The crowd's attack reached the top of the thunderclap monkey's head in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>A dazzling golden light suddenly erupted from the side of that monkey's feet.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>After the golden light, there was a roar.
<br><br>It was then seen that a nine-tailed demon fox rose to the sky.
<br><br>It was covered with a red glow, its huge body brought a large shadow to the ground, and its sinister eyes contained a fierce light that made people tremble with fear at a glance.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"There's actually more than one wooden sculpture?"
<br><br>Seeing this nine-tailed demon fox, Lu Zhengyi revealed a gloomy look and emitted a gloomy voice.
<br><br>"What about the Patriarch?"
<br><br>The crowd felt a strong crisis in this nine-tailed demon fox's body, and could not help but ask towards Lu Zhengyi.
<br><br>"Don't be afraid."
<br><br>"Two is two, could it be that our Baiyang True Palace can't deal with two wooden sculptures?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said in a hurry to stabilize the army.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd also nodded their heads.
<br><br>They are so many experts together, only when the sect war will send out this kind of formation, now still can not beat two wooden eagles?
<br><br>The crowd breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when they were distributing the lineups, how to deal with the two wooden eagles separately, there were ten more golden lights flashing in the pile of rags.
<br><br>Then came the sight of ten men dressed in auspicious clouds and black robes appearing beside the thundercloud monkey.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The flying boat on the white shallow a cold smile frozen, like a lightning strike, immediately scared face white.
<br><br>Especially the leader of the ten men, but is not the one who killed her for the first time?
<br><br>Moreover, Bai Shanyi strongly felt that the one in front of him was much more powerful than the one before.
<br><br>The appearance of the ten people also immediately made Lu Zhengyi and the others dumbfounded.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>They were still dumbfounded, that the garbage pile of golden light kept flashing, one after another, one after another ......
<br><br>A youth with red satin on his shoulders, holding a spear and a red heart on his forehead, flew out on a wheel of wind and fire ......
<br><br>Dozens of men wearing red and white tights, with bulging heads and eyes topped with two goose eggs, rose up as giants of hundreds of feet ......
<br><br>Seven head gourd, wearing a vest bare chest of big-headed dolls, and then tumbled to appear ......
<br><br>Then.
<br><br>There are also hands resting on the pagoda, a middle-aged man of righteousness ......
<br><br>Cut watermelon head, thick eyebrows and big eyes of the guy ......
<br><br>The youth with slippers on his feet and a straw hat on his head ......
<br><br>Blond man with shield in left hand and spear in right hand ......
<br><br>A man in a cloak and tights with his underwear on ......
<br><br>man in red robe with a gourd on his back and a red love mark on his forehead ......
<br><br>Holding a nail rake, fat head of the human pig head and so on all kinds of characters, in a variety of ways to appear ......
<br><br>And accompanied by a burst of roar.
<br><br>Ape taller than the mountain ......
<br><br>A dinosaur like a mountain range ......
<br><br>A giant with a green body ......
<br><br>A golden dragon with five claws ......
<br><br>A phoenix on fire, etc. ......
<br><br>All kinds of monstrous beasts, or vanish into the ground, or rise up in the air.
<br><br>At one time.
<br><br>Under a wide variety of powerful aura, the entire Baier City has turned into an alternative Cyrus Field.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Let all the people present are frozen in place.
<br><br>Just the aura emanating from this group of people and monsters made their bodies dripping with cold sweat.
<br><br>Especially the crowd of Bai Yang True Palace, forehead cold sweat straight, legs and stomach are shaking, difficult to swallow a mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>"How about it, have you seen it?"
<br><br>"Surprise no?"
<br><br>Looking at this superb lineup, Wu Chang'an sitting on the recliner laughed leisurely.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi circulated gulping, breathing heavily, his face was red, holding it for a long, long time before he uttered a sentence.
<br><br>"Today's body is not well, we will fight again in the next day."
<br><br>After saying that, he disregarded the slightest face, the palms of his feet in mid-air straight stomp, and flew towards the flying boat.
<br><br>While flying, he shouted, "Asahi, quick, start the flying boat."
<br><br>But at this moment.
<br><br>A yellow-haired explosive head suddenly swept up into mid-air and appeared at the head of the flying boat.
<br><br>"Immortal law, oh TM take kidney Gan."
<br><br>With a shout from him, a huge blue rotating ball of light coalesced in his hand and blasted towards the flying boat of Bai Yang True Palace.
<br><br>Feeling this power Bai Shanyi hurriedly jumped out of the flying boat, and at the moment she jumped out of the flying boat, the huge ball of energy light, blasted down to the flying boat.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A burst, the flying boat instantly burst, into pieces and spread out, the whole sky in this huge sonic boom, are shaking with a boom.
<br><br>And Bai Shanyi was also directly impacted by the blasting force, spitting out blood from his mouth, and flew backwards, hitting the ground heavily.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The flying boat battleship in our clan, actually just like this ......"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi was immediately dumbfounded.
<br><br>This flying boat can be called their clan's heavy treasure, is spent countless precious materials to build out, can be called a mobile defense fortress, just like this one blow to destroy?
<br><br>This yellow hair, who is this person?
<br><br>How could he be so strong?
<br><br>This simply makes his heart drip blood while feeling a strong sense of fear.
<br><br>But more than the destruction of treasures, more worried about their own lives.
<br><br>Because the flying boat was there, perhaps they could use the extreme speed of the flying boat to escape from here. But the flying boat has been destroyed, want to return in one piece, it is simply impossible.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he turned around with a sullen face and fixed his gaze on Wu Changan.
<br><br>"I did underestimate you guys."
<br><br>"These wooden sculptures are indeed powerful."
<br><br>"Since that's the case, then I, Bai Yang True Palace, will let you people off the hook and we will not cross the river in the future, how about that?"
