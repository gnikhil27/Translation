 "Mao Mao, what is it?"
<br><br>The woman in white asked.
<br><br>"Uh, it's a youth, or a mortal." Mao Mao opened the door a crack and after surveying the door, he turned back and answered.
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>The woman in white knitted her pretty brows and spoke again with jade lips, "Ask him what he wants?"
<br><br>"Says he's borrowing a place to stay, Miss?"
<br><br>Mao Mao's inquiring gaze looked at the woman in white.
<br><br>"Let him in, arrange a courtyard for him, and at the same time warn him that he is not allowed to run around at night." The woman in white ordered, then did not pay any more attention to a glance, and then put her attention on the book.
<br><br>"Hey you come in!"
<br><br>Mao Mao opened the door and a young man carrying a bamboo basket and with a slightly tired face walked in.
<br><br>It was Yi Feng who had gone into the mountains to collect medicine. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>He originally had his own tent, but bad luck, the sky drizzled, coupled with the cold in the mountain, Yi Feng really could not stay.
<br><br>Good thing, there was actually a family deep in this big mountain.
<br><br>"Many thanks."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly said thank you, and only then did he walk into the gate.
<br><br>Just stepping into the gate, Yi Feng was attracted by the sight in front of him, especially that under the waterfall, there was a woman who was so mortal and unearthly sitting.
<br><br>After the new rain rain on the empty mountain.
<br><br>The twilight return to the nest late autumn.
<br><br>Quiet courtyard silver screen three thousand feet.
<br><br>Beautiful woman near the stone to fiddle.
<br><br>This scene, so Yi Feng could not help but borrow the ancient poem from his previous life to praise a little.
<br><br>Of course, in order to respond to the scene, he also made a slight adaptation of the patchwork.
<br><br>Otherwise, it would be incongruous.
<br><br>However, the poem that Yi Feng recited just fell, the woman who had never raised her head to play the piano suddenly looked over with amazement, not expecting that a mortal man in the mountains would actually make such a poem.
<br><br>"After the new rain rain on the empty mountain, into the twilight nest late autumn, the quiet courtyard silver screen three thousand feet, the good man near the stone according to the fiddle ......"
<br><br>Can't help but, she also softly recited.
<br><br>After reciting, but also can not help but nod, for the first time will be serious gaze towards Yi Feng survey.
<br><br>Body.
<br><br>Indeed there is no half cultivation.
<br><br>Mortal without a doubt.
<br><br>Under the drizzle, green shirt slightly wet, but does not show wretched, but rather give a very clean feeling, I have to say, this mortal to her feeling, very comfortable.
<br><br>Also for the first time, let her traditional concept of mortals, slightly changed.
<br><br>"Mortal man, not exactly ......" she thought so, at the same time Qian Qian jade hand put away the book, red lips open said: "Sir good poetry, the little woman thank you."
<br><br>"The girl is polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng arched his hand towards her, and then followed Mao Mao to the residence, before taking a break.
<br><br>"Settled in?"
<br><br>The woman in white asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Settled down Miss." Mao Mao walked back, then opened his small mouth wide in surprise and exclaimed, "Huh Miss, what you wrote, isn't it the same poem that he writes just now?"
<br><br>"Hmm."
<br><br>The woman in white nodded lightly, jade hand holding a pen to write down the poem written by Yi Feng just now.
<br><br>"Hey hey miss, you can't be looking at this mortal, actually wrote down his poem." Mao Mao covered her small mouth on the side and said in a shocked voice.
<br><br>"What are you talking nonsense?"
<br><br>The woman gave Mao Mao a white glance and put down the pen with her luxuriant jade hand.
<br><br>"I just think that this poem of his is really appropriate for our place, before I always felt that we were missing something here, with this poem, it's perfect."
<br><br>"So when the ink dries, after you decorate it, hang it up."
<br><br>"Hee hee, the lady also said that she didn't fancy that mortal and had to hang up his poem." Mao Mao naughtily covered her mouth and laughed.
<br><br>"You ninny, if you keep talking nonsense, be careful I'll beat you up!" The woman in white made a gesture to knock Mao Mao, while her mouth said, "A mortal is only a mortal even if he is good, he is worlds apart from us, besides how would I look at a person based on a poem alone?"
<br><br>"Besides ......"
<br><br>QianYin want to say and stop, did not say more, just will be in the hands of the Red Chamber Dream and the Supreme Treasure tightened.
