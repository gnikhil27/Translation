In the martial arts school, Yi Feng also gave Ye Bei three people a bowl of beef whip soup.
<br><br>After all, with such a big pot, the two of them, master and disciple, might not be able to finish it, so it was no big deal to share a bowl with them.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Three people holding the soup in their hands, the palms of their hands are trembling.
<br><br>You don't need to drink it to see, this bowl of soup dry down I'm afraid than what elixir are more precious.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"It's true that they are all poor people!"
<br><br>Looking at the appearance of the three, Yi Feng couldn't help but feel sad.
<br><br>In fact, he used to be similar, outwardly look like a man, but in fact, eat the last meal is not the next.
<br><br>Just these two years luck has been a lot better, by writing books or something to make a fortune.
<br><br>"Drink up, just a bowl of soup, no need to be embarrassed." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng gently reminded.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The three people could not help but smile bitterly.
<br><br>It is true that it is just a bowl of soup for you, but for them, it is a great opportunity that they have never had in their lives.
<br><br>The three of them swallowed it down.
<br><br>As soon as they got down, the medicinal power inside the bullwhip soup turned into a warm stream and surged all over their bodies.
<br><br>"My physique and meridian structure seems to have changed in some way." Ye Bei lowered his voice and couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Not bad, me too."
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que likewise couldn't help but nod his head.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng also similarly found himself in this condition.
<br><br>The three of them were instantly surprised.
<br><br>This was because this new physique brought them great benefits, benefits that were not simply as simple as boosting their strength.
<br><br>Rather, it was a qualitative enhancement.
<br><br>A fundamental enhancement.
<br><br>"For the future realm, I don't seem to have a bottleneck anymore." Ye Bei couldn't help but say again.
<br><br>"Me too, it feels like as long as I am given enough time to cultivate, what Martial Saint Martial Emperor is not a problem anymore." Shaking Heavenly Que was equally excited and danced around.
<br><br>The Guan Yunpeng on the side was even more excited with tears about to fall down.
<br><br>Although they didn't know what kind of physique they had become now, but this chance, it was simply too big!
<br><br>"Thank you, thank you sir."
<br><br>"Sir is like our regenerated parents."
<br><br>Saying that, the three people turned their hot tear-filled gazes towards Yi Feng, and wild voices came out one after another.
<br><br>"You guys are too polite, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said as he sipped the beef whip soup.
<br><br>"You should be should be."
<br><br>The three people hurriedly said.
<br><br>But at the same time as they spoke, all three of them held their faces ugly.
<br><br>Because when they were drinking tea earlier, they were already close to breaking through, and now that another bowl of cow whip soup had dried up, the cultivation in their bodies had long since exploded.
<br><br>"Sir, we'll take our leave first."
<br><br>Because they were worried about disturbing Yi Feng by breaking through here, the three of them hurriedly said goodbye.
<br><br>"Are you leaving so soon?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"We've already had enough." Ye Bei hurriedly explained, "And still mindful of what this gentleman explained, we'll go back and gather people here."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we have to go back and gather people first."
<br><br>Shake Heavenly Que and Guan Yunpeng also hurriedly concurred.
<br><br>"Well, that's fine, I won't keep you guys."
<br><br>Yi Feng finished the soup in his hand and got up to see them off to the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>"By the way sir, do you have any requirements for the workers, what do you want?" Before leaving, Ye Bei asked again.
<br><br>"Of course it is necessary to have people reliable, and the strength certainly can not be too weak, after all, doing is also physical work is not." Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>"Reliable, can not be too weak."
<br><br>Ye Bei three people looked at each other, nodded solemnly, and then left.
<br><br>And at this time, the cold-faced Bai Lengxi had already killed not far from the martial arts school.
<br><br>At this moment, anger was burning in her heart.
<br><br>God Body.
<br><br>But a divine body.
<br><br>This kind of physique from the ancient era had already disappeared for many years ah, it was no exaggeration to say that Zhong Qing was probably the last God Physique on the Immortal River Continent today.
<br><br>However, such an important physique was dried up by a bowl of soup.
<br><br>How could this make her not angry?
<br><br>And coming not far from the martial school, she was just about to kill her way into the martial school when she saw Yi Feng sending Ye Bei and the others away.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor, Martial Dignity and so on."
<br><br>"Hmph."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi just casually surveyed Ye Bei a few people, despite their breath well hidden, but Bai Lengxi still a glance through, disdainful cold snort.
<br><br>Because people of this cultivation level are really nothing in her eyes.
<br><br>Just then, the divine Phoenix Body inside him suddenly appeared to throb.
<br><br>And the source of this throbbing was coming from the Ye Bei trio.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's entire body trembled violently.
<br><br>Because her divine phoenix body was a branch of the divine body of that year, there could only be one possibility to make her divine phoenix body appear this throbbing.
<br><br>That is to encounter the ancient divine body.
<br><br>And it's not the kind of recessive ancient divine body of Zhong Qing, but the kind of divine body that is completely activated.
<br><br>In other words, the three people in front of Ye Bei, all of them are carrying ancient divine bodies.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>She was dumbfounded.
<br><br>The previous her searched the entire continent, none of them were found, and it was only through Lin Mo Lao Dao's calculations that she calculated that Zhong Qing might have a divine body.
<br><br>But now.
<br><br>But now there were three at once.
<br><br>Since when could ancient divine bodies pile up?
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face was filled with horror.
<br><br>The three divine bodies that appeared all at once directly refreshed her perception.
<br><br>And at this time, Yi Feng, who was still holding a bowl of bullwhip soup in his hand, burped, his expression filled with helplessness.
<br><br>This pot of soup.
<br><br>It's really too much.
<br><br>He was about to die, and there was still so much left, how can this be good!
<br><br>"Beef seller, come here."
<br><br>Yi Feng beckoned towards the beef stall boy across the street.
<br><br>"What's the order, sir."
<br><br>The boy put the towel on his shoulder and trotted over.
<br><br>"There is a saying that women are thirty like tigers, forty like wolves, fifty sitting on the ground and sucking dirt, sixty sucking rats through the wall, that old lady of yours is only thirty-four or fifty, but looking at that body embryo, I am afraid the demand is also when fifty or sixty female tigers."
<br><br>"So you come, I just have a bowl of soup here, give you a tonic."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a leisurely smile.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>The boy bowed and downed the bullwhip soup in one gulp.
<br><br>He was just about to leave when Yi Feng shouted again, "Wait a minute, I still have half a pot here, you bring it to your stall, call Old Li who sells tofu, Old Zhao from the vegetable market, and Old Sun who plays chess, all drink together."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>The boy carried the soup out from the martial arts hall and then set it on the beef stall table.
<br><br>With a shout from him.
<br><br>Seven or eight old men came over with faces full of fervor and competed to drink the beef whip soup first.
<br><br>For all this, Bai Lengxi saw in the eyes, but did not care.
<br><br>After all, a group of mortals in the city, it is not necessary for her to waste her mind.
<br><br>At the same time, she did not rush to find Yi Feng's trouble, but her mind was spinning madly, why three divine bodies appeared here at once.
<br><br>But at that moment, her divine phoenix body appeared to throb again.
<br><br>"Flutter."
<br><br>"Flutter."
<br><br>"Flutter."
<br><br>"Fluttering. ......"
<br><br>The throbbing was continuous.
<br><br>Stronger than the previous throbbing sensation of seeing the three Ye Bei, a time to make her blood soar.
