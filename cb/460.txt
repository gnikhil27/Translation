Lv Xin for the face draws animal.
<br><br>Angry body trembling and shaking.
<br><br>Could it be.
<br><br>His Xuan Xian cultivation, also not worthy to let this black-robed man in the eyes?
<br><br>Did he not hear clearly, or did he not believe himself?
<br><br>"Well, well."
<br><br>This completely inspired Lu Xinwei's desire to conquer, vowing to make this black-robed man available to him.
<br><br>"Wait a minute."
<br><br>Lv Xinwei shouted lightly, then quickly caught up with the four skeletal Benevolent, stopping in front of them.
<br><br>"You people are sick, right?" Skeleton Ben Wei said arrogantly with his crossed arms.
<br><br>Lu Xinwei's face was ugly. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>However, he endured the offensive words of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>In today's Immortal River Continent, it was really not easy to have such an expert, which had a vital role in his future grand plan.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>He turned the storage ring in his hand.
<br><br>A delicate box came out.
<br><br>"This is an Immortal Grade Xuan Dan, using it, you will be able to advance one small level in the Xuan Xian realm, without side effects."
<br><br>"In addition ......"
<br><br>Saying that, he took out another long sword that shone with a cold light.
<br><br>"This is one of my Lingxu Realm's heavy treasures, possessing this sword will enable you to have the ability to fight beyond the level, it was scrambled by me from a secret realm back then."
<br><br>"Now, both of these supreme treasures can be given to you, only if you promise me one condition."
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>Lu Xinwei raised the corner of his mouth to look at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>He didn't believe that with such heavy treasures, he still couldn't impress Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>To know.
<br><br>These two treasures even in the Lingxu Realm were things that could sell for sky-high prices and even make people earn their heads.
<br><br>"Just this?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei gave a sidelong glance and sauntered away.
<br><br>Lu Xinwei froze once again.
<br><br>Because in the face of these two supreme treasures, he actually saw contempt in Bone Ben Wei's eyes?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Not only the skeleton Ben Wei, the dog and black bear also walked past one after another with a slanted glance, half-heartedly to his two supreme treasures.
<br><br>It was the centipede who walked at the end that stayed one step.
<br><br>"Buddy, just these two garbage, you'd better not take them out, but also immortal pills, my dog brother knocked sugar beans are better than you this."
<br><br>The centipede also went away after saying a long sentence.
<br><br>"Garbage?"
<br><br>Lu Xinwei stood in the same place, his face a puff of animal.
<br><br>His two treasures were actually treated as garbage?
<br><br>Was he ignorant of the goods or did he not put him, Lu Xinwei, in his eyes?
<br><br>He was burning with rage, his body bursting out with anger, his eyes flashing with a strong coldness.
<br><br>With his status, even in the Lingxu Realm, he would not stoop so low as to take the initiative to befriend others.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>But here he was belittled over and over again.
<br><br>This is intolerable, what can't be tolerated!
<br><br>He swept out and directly stopped in front of the four Bone Benevolent.
<br><br>"Four of you, you are a little too noble."
<br><br>"Just because you have no enemies in the Immortal River Continent, do you really think that there is no one in this world who can cure you?"
<br><br>Lu Xinwei's voice came out gloomily.
<br><br>"I say you people, forcing to chatter for most of the day, what do you want?"
<br><br>Finally, Bone Ben Wei gave him an impatient look.
<br><br>"What do you want?"
<br><br>Lv Xinwei let out a cold snort and said, "This seat originally wanted to treat you as a guest, but you respect the wine, then I will not circle around with you, I want you, submit to me, work for me, serve me."
<br><br>"Today you have to agree and disagree."
<br><br>Lv Xinwei said soberly, the body's mighty pressure unrestrainedly exposed.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Lv Xinwei's words made the three dogs look like they had heard some big joke, their faces became wonderful to the extreme, and they looked at Lv Xinwei as if he was a fool.
<br><br>"What, don't believe it?"
<br><br>Seeing several people like this, Lu Xinwei sneered, "How about we have a match to see who is stronger, and if you are not beaten, submit to me?"
<br><br>"OK, you hurry up and make your move."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei slanted a glance at Lu Xinwei and said impatiently.
<br><br>"I make a move?"
<br><br>Lv Xinwei sneered and said, "I'm afraid I won't have the chance for you to make a move if I do, so I'll give you a chance to make the first move!"
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei nodded, didn't even look at him, and casually blasted out with a fist.
