Even the cultivation of the weaker people, at this moment can not stand.
<br><br>Also at the same time, countless experts within the entire Heavenly Sword Gate mountain gate flew out, stepping in mid-air and looking at the Heavenly Sword Gate below.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"How could this happen?"
<br><br>"What change has happened?"
<br><br>For a while, the crowd emitted gruff voices.
<br><br>"This what wall is quite hard, and it's quite mysterious."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the hole exposed in the wall after being kicked in front of him and couldn't help but spit out.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This hole looks a little small, not enough to let Yi Feng go in.
<br><br>After all, after kicking it open, Yi Feng might be able to get out of here. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Saying that, he kicked up a few more feet.
<br><br>"Rumble rumble rumble ......"
<br><br>Also at the same time, the Heavenly Sword Gate, which had just subsided, once again emitted a deafening sound, and many buildings shook as if they were about to collapse.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>A group of senior members of the Heavenly Sword Sect hovered in the sky, their faces were becoming more and more gloomy.
<br><br>"It should be a problem with the foundation of our Heavenly Sword Sect!" Duan Qingfeng guessed.
<br><br>"But how is this possible, the foundation of our Heavenly Sword Sect is made up of formations, and it was personally arranged by the founding ancestor, so how could something go wrong?" One of the elders said incredulously.
<br><br>"But right now, the Heavenly Sword Sect is in such turmoil, I really can't think of what's going on other than the foundation." Duan Qingfeng flashed a sharp gaze and ordered, "But no matter what the problem is, it will be clear once we investigate it, all of you listen to the order, investigate the cause thoroughly."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Numerous elders swept out into the air and urgently went to investigate the cause.
<br><br>Jiayi City.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Sir has been kidnapped?"
<br><br>"This Heavenly Sword Sect's Peng Xian'er has too much guts to actually kidnap Mister."
<br><br>Yang Tianyu and the rest of the bigwigs were stunned when they received the news.
<br><br>"But, how could sir be captured?" Yang Tianyu asked incredulously, "With his cultivation level, how could a little Peng Xian'er capture him?"
<br><br>"How can we guess what a high ranking person does, but I think there should be a deep meaning!" Xue Qinzhu guessed, "And this signal from sir is already obvious, obviously his next layout is related to the Heavenly Sword Sect, but I don't know if this is a blessing or a curse for the Heavenly Sword Sect."
<br><br>"Then it's not too late, let's immediately rush to the Heavenly Sword Sect to find out the situation!"
<br><br>The crowd said one after another.
<br><br>Countless forces then converged towards the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>Inn.
<br><br>"What do we do?"
<br><br>Porky Rong asked towards old man Wang.
<br><br>"Look at those three." Old man Wang glanced at his head and said with an intention.
<br><br>At his words, the crowd looked their eyes over.
<br><br>They found Skeleton Ben Wei, Dog, and a centipede lying at the window, with a shout of surprise and an occasional exclamation.
<br><br>"This is?" Porky Wing did not understand.
<br><br>However, Wu Yonghong reacted and said with a smile, "The meaning of this is obvious, that scum is not in a hurry, we need not be in a hurry, I think the gentleman this time, should be playful and want to play a little game!"
<br><br>"So it is."
<br><br>Pork Rong dawned on him, and asked, "Then we ......"
<br><br>"Fight landlord to pass the time, when the gentleman has played enough, he will naturally come back!" Wu Yonghong slapped a deck of playing cards on the table and laughed.
<br><br>Seeing this, Pork Rong and Old Man Wang's eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Good good, but old Wu you have to let us ha, we just learned not long ago."
<br><br>"Good talk, good talk."
<br><br>"Come on, hurry up and shuffle the cards."
<br><br>"A pair of small threes."
<br><br>"A pair of small four."
<br><br>"Pressed to death ......"
<br><br>"Pork Rong you hurry up ah, I wait for the flowers are thankful ......"
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>"What kind of shitty place is this?"
<br><br>Yi Feng finally walked out of that barren place, but after kicking open the strange glass, immediately found that many, many glasses appeared in front of him.
<br><br>This feeling gave Yi Feng a feeling of walking into the kind of star house in his previous life, dim and dark, like a maze, a chaos.
<br><br>"Damn, I see how much glass you have, all fucking kick you away."
<br><br>Yi Feng knew that backing out was impossible, so he started kicking the glass to find a way out.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>The next time, the entire Heavenly Sword Sect ground shaking, from time to time came the deafening sound, countless buildings collapsed in pieces, even the back peak of the forbidden land of the Heavenly Sword Sect also appeared cracks.
<br><br>"Sect Master, Sect Master, your palace has collapsed!"
<br><br>"Sect Master it's not good, the main hall of the council is cracked in half."
<br><br>All around poured scurrying human figures, as if in a world of doom.
<br><br>And in addition to the surface of the turmoil, the original everywhere emitting aura of the mountain door, the breath also became flocculent, a large number of spiritual energy began to lose.
<br><br>"Master, what the hell is going on here!" Peng Xian'er asked with a pale face as she followed behind Duan Qingfeng.
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng was anxious and couldn't tell what was going on.
<br><br>Just then, an elder flew in and hurriedly said, "Patriarch, we found the cause, it's indeed a problem with the sect's root formation, and the source seems to be in the Prisoner Dragon Domain."
<br><br>"Prisoner Dragon Domain?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng's face changed and he shouted, "Everyone follow me to the entrance of the Prisoner Dragon Domain."
<br><br>Everyone flew towards the Prisoner Dragon Domain.
<br><br>Arriving at the entrance, Duan Qingfeng couldn't help but ask: "Has the sect recently shut in anything new into it?"
<br><br>The crowd shook their heads one after another.
<br><br>This prisoner dragon domain generally only imprisoned the sect's traitors, as well as the enemies captured by the Heavenly Sword Sect, and over the years with the Heavenly Sword Sect's prestige in Nansha, there were less people who dared to go against them, so it had been a long time since the prisoner dragon domain had been opened.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was ready to say something on the side, but after thinking about it, she dismissed it.
<br><br>After all, she just imprisoned a mortal into it, it couldn't possibly cause such a big turmoil, so she didn't say anything.
<br><br>"Patriarch, what now?" Someone asked.
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng hesitated for a long time and said in a deep voice, "Come with me into the Prisoner Dragon Domain and find out what's going on."
<br><br>"What, Sovereign, that's too dangerous, right?"
<br><br>The crowd paled.
<br><br>After all, the Dragon Prisoner Domain is a violent place where all spiritual energy is cut off, even with their cultivation level, their strength will not survive, and if they stay for a long time, I am afraid it will affect their cultivation level.
<br><br>What's more, there are countless big demons inside since the creation of the Heavenly Sword Sect, locked in.
<br><br>These big demons may not have much demonic power, and even most of them can only maintain their original body size to survive inside, but to survive is enough to prove their extraordinary.
<br><br>These people go in and encounter these demon beasts, a moment may be able to protect themselves, but if the whole prison dragon domain of the demon beasts and attacked, I am afraid that only fleeing for their lives.
<br><br>"No matter how dangerous it is, we still have to go in."
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng gritted his teeth and said, "Without finding out what happened, there is no way to solve the turmoil of my Heavenly Sword Sect, in case all the mountain protection formations are destroyed, the consequences will be unimaginable."
<br><br>The crowd heard the words and knew the importance.
<br><br>Only then did they grit their teeth and nod their heads in agreement.
<br><br>Under the leadership of Duan Qingfeng, a group of experts from the Heavenly Sword Sect stepped into the Prisoner Dragon Domain vigilantly.
<br><br>As they stepped into it, everyone's cultivation was suppressed to one out of ten, and their body's Yuan Qi was in chaos, so they couldn't even fly through the air.
<br><br>Stepping on the yellow sand, the crowd walked vigilantly.
<br><br>But what puzzled them was that they hadn't encountered a single demonic beast along the way.
<br><br>This is really too evil!
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng felt more and more gloomy, and countless question marks rose in his heart, after all, it was reasonable to say that those demonic beasts would quickly pounce when they smelled the scent of a living person.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
