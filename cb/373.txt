The moment Black Feather was mentioned, Yun Xiang's whole face turned twisted.
<br><br>Clenching his teeth, he said word by word with a face full of hatred, "The reason why we were all wiped out is because of Black Feather."
<br><br>"Black Feather, Black Feather, he defected a long time ago."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Black Feather defected?"
<br><br>These words were like a heavy slap on Su Xuanjun's face.
<br><br>He never expected that his close friend, who had followed him for 10,000 years, would actually mutiny outright.
<br><br>"Tell me, tell me what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>"I valued him so much and even trusted him with the immortal weapon as well, how could he mutiny against me?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun asked incredulously.
<br><br>"Lord of the Continent, Black Feather has really rebelled." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Not only did he mutiny, he also gave all of your immortal artifacts as well as immortal pills to the other side's people in front of us." Cloud Elephant said one by one.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>These words directly made Su Xuanjun, who was attacked by anger, fiercely took a step backward, a mouthful of blood spilled out from the corner of his mouth, and his body was shaking sharply.
<br><br>"Continent Lord."
<br><br>"Lord of the Continent, calm your anger."
<br><br>"Are you all right, Lord?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the others held Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>"Get lost."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun waved his big hand, the crowd was pushed out by the force, then he angrily hairy voice came out, "Black feather ah black feather, really think I give immortal weapon you, simply because of trust?"
<br><br>"All do not know, I want to kill you easily."
<br><br>With that, he moved his palm, a complicated hand seal was immediately struck, directly crossing the border through the void space and contacted Black Feather.
<br><br>"Hey, big brother, all of these are the treasures scavenged from the bodies of this group of trash."
<br><br>On the edge of the lake.
<br><br>Since the island was still under construction, so Yi Feng temporarily placed these Black Feather these beasts outside the island.
<br><br>At this time, Black Feather respectfully squatted beside Bone Ben Wei and pushed a large pile of treasures to Bone Ben Wei's side.
<br><br>"Qing ah, take it and give it to the master, enrich the trash heap for the master."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei did not even look at it, waved his hand and ordered, then lay down under the tree.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The dog took the milking agent and began to move the treasure.
<br><br>However, this scene made the immortal world's demons hate their teeth.
<br><br>A pair of hateful eyes glared at Black Feather.
<br><br>"What are you glaring at?"
<br><br>"You hot chicken, are you worthy of glaring at me?"
<br><br>Black Feather landed on their bodies with a claw, suppressing them to the ground.
<br><br>The demons lying on the ground stared at Black Feather with dead eyes, gritting their teeth and passing out a bitter voice towards Black Feather word by word.
<br><br>"Black feather, the cloud elephant has gone back, the continental lord will kill over soon, you can't pop up for long."
<br><br>"That's right, you just wait to die, don't think that with that black-robed man backing you will be able to withstand the continent lord's wrath!"
<br><br>It seemed that their words were fulfilled by the spirit, just as the voice fell, a force came and a virtual shadow appeared above Black Feather's head.
<br><br>He was a tiger.
<br><br>With an angry face, his body exuded a thick aura.
<br><br>It was the shadow projected by Su Xuanjun through the heavenly means.
<br><br>Seeing this shadow, the subdued immortal world demons almost left tears of excitement, and roars of excitement came out of each mouth.
<br><br>"Black feather."
<br><br>"How did I, Su Xuanjun, treat you, why did you betray me?"
<br><br>Immortal world Su Xuanjun through the projection over the shadow, saw the subordinates who were suppressed, and the spirited black feather, suddenly angry, mouth out of the thick voice.
<br><br>"You old bastard, it's now, what are you still shouting for?"
<br><br>"How else do you treat me, I pooh."
<br><br>"You've been fucking feeding me raw meat for 10,000 years, have you considered my feelings?"
<br><br>Black feather has skeleton Ben Wei behind the back, pressed half unbelieving, crossed his back and cursed.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Su Xuanjun's body trembled with anger, ice-cold face, threatened: "I don't care what your reason is, no one has dared to betray me, now give you a chance to make up for your mistakes, send the old man's immortal weapon and immortal pills back, I'll leave you a whole body, otherwise ......"
<br><br>"Or else what do you do?"
<br><br>However, before Su Xuanjun could finish, he was interrupted by Black Feather.
<br><br>"You think it's still in your broken Green Jade Immortal Continent, you don't even look at whose subordinate I am now, and you dare to talk big here."
<br><br>"You come you come, you come and kill me, please come and kill me."
<br><br>Black feather crossed his waist, hooked his finger towards Su Xuanjun, and his words were full of provocation.
<br><br>"You, you you ......"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's body trembled with anger, and under the fury, the air around him became distorted, and those subordinates of his were under great pressure.
<br><br>"Then, even if I don't want this immortal weapon, I will now kill you on the spot."
<br><br>The angry Su Xuanjun could no longer remain calm, his palm flipped, and at the same time, the shadow also stretched out his palm, a thick palm print blasted down towards Black Feather.
<br><br>Wait!
<br><br>But just as his palm fell, his body trembled violently, and his palm froze straight in mid-air.
<br><br>Because he caught a glimpse of something unusual, even frightening to him, through the corner of the eyes of the shadow.
<br><br>Just now, on the edge of that lake, there was an old man who supported a boat past was ......
<br><br>He hastily lifted his gaze and cast it toward the lake.
<br><br>Also when he cast his gaze over, the old man who was rowing the boat, also happened to incline his head towards him and glanced over.
<br><br>Smiling.
<br><br>But it was this smiling glance that almost scared Su Xuanjun's soul away.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>He thought of a terrifying existence, and a legend that made people tremble.
<br><br>He hurriedly withdrew his gaze and was considering what to do when he saw another thing that made him even more terrified.
<br><br>In another direction, a young man in white and a monk were slowly walking and chatting.
<br><br>"Aiya, monk Kunpeng, we are really destiny, I really did not expect you to chemistry to my place!" Yi Feng said with a smile, then sniffed his nose again and said leisurely, "But this smell on you, is it rouge?"
<br><br>"It is indeed a fate."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng folded his hands and smiled gently, "As for the rouge you said, that must be your mistake in smelling, how could a monk get this kind of thing on him?"
<br><br>Seemingly afraid that Yi Feng did not believe, Kun Peng added: "Monks do not play deceitful words."
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>But looking at the monk Kun Peng, Su Xuanjun drew another breath of cold air.
<br><br>This monk, this monk is ......
<br><br>Thinking of this, his body was already trembling and shaking.
<br><br>Just when he was retreating on one side, but hesitating between killing the black feather, he subconsciously glanced at another scene, directly scared him seven.
