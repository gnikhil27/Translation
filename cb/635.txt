"How was it?"
<br><br>"Exciting, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>Enjoyed the small eyes of this group of little disciples who were shocked and dismayed.
<br><br>It was also.
<br><br>One mortal.
<br><br>Frying as a chef.
<br><br>Robbery when the king of the mountain.
<br><br>Riding cows to plant rice seedlings.
<br><br>All of a sudden became immortal, not surprised and stunned to be strange.
<br><br>But the disciples panicked. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>It was hard to cultivate one by one to the present realm, but to go back to the earth immortal all of a sudden?
<br><br>"Master brothers, calm down a little, will the master still pit us?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun transmitted a voice towards the crowd, "Since Master said he was giving us a chance, then he must be giving us a chance."
<br><br>"Even if Master wants to lower our cultivation level, we still have to believe that it is for our good!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The master brothers nodded their heads one after another.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>They were given this entire Dao by their master.
<br><br>Wouldn't Master still pit them against each other.
<br><br>In a flash, the crowd accepted the result.
<br><br>"We thank the Master for this."
<br><br>The disciples knelt on the ground one after another.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Yi Feng was satisfied.
<br><br>While internally communicating with the system, he rather pretentiously waved his palm.
<br><br>A mysterious power descended and fell on the crowd of disciples.
<br><br>Sure enough the next moment.
<br><br>The disciples, no matter what their original cultivation levels were, all became Earth Immortals in this moment.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Although I have become an Earth Immortal realm, my strength has not weakened, but on the contrary, it seems to have improved quite a bit." Su Yun Yun Yun felt her cultivation level in dismay and transmitted a voice towards the disciples.
<br><br>"Me too."
<br><br>Li Tai Bai's eyes shone with light as he transmitted his voice.
<br><br>"Yes, this feeling is like, compressing our original cultivation level, seemingly becoming lower, but qualitatively changing." Qian Duo Duo transmitted his voice.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"If our original cultivation is an ocean, it is equivalent to now compressing it into a small pond, but every drop of water left in the pond is the essence of the impurities that have been dispelled!"
<br><br>Su Yunyun was busy nodding, her heart growing more and more excited.
<br><br>Master this hand.
<br><br>Not only did it solidify their cultivation, it was equal to pulling up their ceiling against the heavens.
<br><br>Just imagine, her current Earth Immortal cultivation was able to take down the Sun and Moon Immortal Realm in seconds.
<br><br>If one day, in this state, she raised her cultivation to the original realm, it would still be seconds to the sky and the earth and the air?
<br><br>"We, thank you so much, Master."
<br><br>The crowd of master brothers knelt on the ground respectfully, and respectful voices came out one after another, and at the moment of frenzy in their eyes, they looked at Yi Feng as if they were looking at a god.
<br><br>After elevating all the disciples to Earth Immortal, Yi Feng began to elevate others to Human Immortal.
<br><br>The first ones were Qing Huan Xiang, Ye Bei Shake Tian Que and others.
<br><br>This was followed by the dung-picking class and the vegetable-growing class.
<br><br>And finally called the island's other old men, such as Zhao Qian Sun Li, Zhou Wu Zheng Wang and other masters also elevated one by one.
<br><br>Busy for several days.
<br><br>Yi Feng felt doubly satisfied.
<br><br>So many earth immortals plus a thousand human immortals, to put aside this immortal river continent, is certainly invincible.
<br><br>If there is no system prompted the hundred-year catastrophe, with this group of disciples and masters in the immortal river continent as the emperor of the land is not too comfortable.
<br><br>But can not ah.
<br><br>I have to reach the goal of raising fifty levels in a hundred years, so that I can be sure to face the catastrophe in a hundred years.
<br><br>"Zhong Qing, pay respects to Master."
<br><br>In the courtyard.
<br><br>Zhong Qing respectfully knelt next to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Disciple, what is this, get up." Yi Feng helped up his precious disciple who had experienced a lot with him in these two years, and said softly, "Who are we with, no need to be so polite."
<br><br>"It's Master who has given me the ultimate cultivation!"
<br><br>"This is something I didn't dare to imagine before."
<br><br>Zhong Qing was full of gratitude and his palm tightened the large sword in his hand, "Now with this strength, I can finally have a chance to start my revenge plan."
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"It's really hard on you."
<br><br>Yi Feng touched Zhong Qing's head, the hatred in this child's heart, how could he not know it.
<br><br>"I think, now that you have Earth Immortal strength, you should be able to take revenge!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Can be, but they were originally an ancient family in the Immortal River Continent, and in their clan, it seems that the Immortal Realm also has roots." Zhong Qing said, "And that enemy who killed my parents, seems to have also ascended to the Immortal Realm."
<br><br>"I heard my master once say that the earth immortals are in the immortal world, and they seem to be quite weak." Zhong Qing raised his head weakly and said, "So, can I make one more request to Master."
<br><br>"Go ahead."
<br><br>"Can I ask the master to borrow all the senior brothers and sisters, so that they can help me to take revenge together." Zhong Qing said sincerely, "Because I might not be able to beat one Earth Immortal, but a hundred of them, it should be possible."
<br><br>"Silly boy."
<br><br>"You yourself are the senior brother of that group of mongrel guys, you want them to help you, you can just tell them directly, where to borrow or not."
<br><br>"But I feel that you are a bit redundant, or master I help you out to fuck them!" Yi Feng raised the corners of his mouth, squeezed his fist and said.
<br><br>"No, I still want to kill the enemy with my own hands, this is a knot in my heart."
<br><br>"If the master had done it, he might have been able to avenge me easily, but that's not what I want." Zhong Qing said firmly through clenched teeth.
<br><br>Yi Feng had a black line.
<br><br>This child.
<br><br>Why is he so single-minded.
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Yi Feng had no choice but to agree.
<br><br>"Many thanks, Master." Zhong Qing kowtowed, "But disciple has one more question to ask master."
<br><br>"You say."
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Master is so powerful, why has my disciple never known about it?"
<br><br>"And why did Master take the disciple to eat chaff for two months before he wrote the book to make money?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing weakly lifted his head and asked in a serious manner.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>This question asked Yi Feng a face of embarrassment.
<br><br>This said as if he wanted to eat chaff and gulps at that time.
<br><br>This is not at that time he is also a weak chicken well.
<br><br>But how to say this to the disciples?
<br><br>Can't say that he became an immortal one day because of the system, right?
<br><br>That how to look like a mob, that how humiliating ha!
<br><br>"Ahem, disciple ah." After a moment of silence, Yi Feng coughed twice and said in a serious voice: "To be honest, your master I show my cards, I am actually a hidden world, do not ask the world's affairs of the supreme master!"
<br><br>"The supreme master well, have to have that state of mind, have to have that model, since the precipitation of mortal life, then you can not rely on cultivation to achieve the purpose!"
<br><br>"For what?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing looked up and asked.
<br><br>"Uh, affect the cultivation!"
<br><br>Yi Feng casually excused and said.
<br><br>"So that's how it is, Master is highly intelligent." Zhong Qing pondered.
<br><br>And not far away.
<br><br>Chen Kunpeng, who was sweeping the floor, came this way.
<br><br>"Alas, curiosity kills people!"
<br><br>"When we first met, the poor monk felt that Master Yi was hiding secrets and was definitely not the supreme master that people had been talking about, so in order to find out what kind of person Master Yi really was, he deliberately lurked on the island for such a long time."
<br><br>"After staying for so long, from all the demeanor, it is really not what the poor monk expected, this monk Yi is not a great master at all before, and the cultivation is only recently acquired."
<br><br>"But now it's just a guess, we still have to find Master Yi to confirm and confirm."
<br><br>"Also ask him what secrets he really has."
<br><br>Chen Kunpeng walked towards Yi Feng's courtyard with a smile on his face.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as he walked to the courtyard door, he heard Yi Feng's conversation to Zhong Qing's young disciple.
<br><br>His eyes suddenly glared.
<br><br>"So the poor monk was hasty!"
