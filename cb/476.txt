"Die!"
<br><br>"No one can save you!"
<br><br>Chen Yi Zhen always smiled faintly.
<br><br>It was that confident about taking Su Yunyun's life.
<br><br>Even if he already knew that Su Yunyun's side has a good strength of the black man, also more know Su Yunyun is in this martial arts school some extraordinary, that the entrance of the martial arts word sign filled with a strong martial intent ......
<br><br>But even so, in his opinion, a finger to kill Su Yunyun is also still a sure thing.
<br><br>This is the absolute confidence that comes with great strength.
<br><br>This finger.
<br><br>Already with the power of destruction, it descended on Su Yun Yun's head.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun had a reluctant face.
<br><br>But in the face of absolute power, she has already given up struggling. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, the backyard of the martial arts school suddenly came a heavenly aura, as if a demon had awakened, making the heart and soul tremble.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>An acacia tree branch suddenly reached out and instantly wrapped around Chen Yizhen's palm.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Feeling the power coming from this branch, Chen Yizhen's mouth spit out an incredible voice.
<br><br>This tree branch.
<br><br>How could it have such a strong power?
<br><br>It actually made him unable to break free?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before his shock subsided, the branch that wrapped around him came with an even stronger power, making him completely unable to resist.
<br><br>In an instant, Chen Yizhen, along with his entire body, was torn towards the backyard of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Su Yunyun, who had thought that she was sure to die, also stared at this moment, stunned by this incredible scene.
<br><br>She hurriedly chased him to the backyard.
<br><br>But when she looked at the scene she saw happening in the backyard, she covered her mouth in shock, and her face turned pale with fright.
<br><br>She saw Chen Yizhen being pulled to the backyard by that old acacia tree in the yard, and from inside that well in the backyard, a toad jumped out.
<br><br>The toad croaked twice, opened its mouth full of devouring power, and swallowed Chen Yizhen in one bite.
<br><br>After burping and giving Su Yunyun a glance, he jumped back inside the well.
<br><br>And the old acacia tree, which erupted with a monstrous aura, like an astounding demon, also completely regained its calm.
<br><br>As if.
<br><br>What just happened had never happened.
<br><br>But the courtyard restored calm, Su Yunyun's heart, but set off a shocking wave, even if she respected as an immortal emperor in her previous life, but never saw such a shocking scene.
<br><br>This made her unable to calm down for a long time.
<br><br>All this.
<br><br>It was a long story.
<br><br>But from the time Chen Yi Zhen made his move, until he was swallowed by the toad, it was only two breaths of time.
<br><br>And it was just a short two breaths.
<br><br>Chen Yizhen, actually, was gone?
<br><br>Although this is not Chen Yizhen's body, but only a doppelganger, but the strength of this doppelganger right now, at least has the cultivation of Xuan Xian!
<br><br>A XuanXian Immortal just instantly lost, this is too let people feel unreal.
<br><br>And she finally woke up to the fact that Bone Ben Wei was not lying to her at all.
<br><br>And understand even more, why the previous skeleton Ben Wei scolded her for running around and called her a fool.
<br><br>It turned out that when she faced those three old men before, there was absolutely no need for her to run, and if she stayed properly in the martial arts school, she would be incomparably safe.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Inside this martial arts hall, even Chen Yi Zhen's doppelganger swallowed instantly, those three old men could not turn up any waves?
<br><br>It was ridiculous that she had even made a smart move to invoke the teleportation scroll and teleported herself out of the safety barrier.
<br><br>She was filled with a bitter smile.
<br><br>Only now did she realize that she was the real clown.
<br><br>After a long, long time, Su Yunyun finally had some peace in her heart.
<br><br>And at that moment.
<br><br>The time for her first turn of Nirvana had also finally passed.
<br><br>At this moment, she had a qualitative improvement in both her talent and qi, and her cultivation level, as well as her senses, were also recovering rapidly.
<br><br>Only, she couldn't wait to fully recover before rushing to the backyard.
<br><br>She wanted to find out.
<br><br>What exactly was the old acacia tree that struck last night?
<br><br>What kind of existence was that toad at the bottom of the well?
<br><br>But.
<br><br>With her eyesight, she actually failed to see half of the clues.
<br><br>The well.
<br><br>It was still the same well.
<br><br>That can be acacia tree is also still the same acacia tree, seems to see no half anomaly, but also can not capture half of the other breath.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>The acacia tree and toad she could not see anything, sensory cultivation restored her, but in the kitchen next door in the utility room, saw something even more incredible.
<br><br>Knives, spears, swords and halberds of all kinds of weapons were piled up all over a large room, just like rags piled up.
<br><br>But Su Yunyun was staring at her eyes, unable to breathe.
<br><br>Because, among the weapons that were piled up with the rags, in addition to the Immortal River Continent's saint and emperor grade, there was also an immortal weapon level found among them.
<br><br>And among them, a coat rack especially caught her attention.
<br><br>"This is, for drying clothes?"
<br><br>She blinked and carefully picked up the hanger and sized it up.
<br><br>But when she held the hanger in her hand, her whole body trembled violently as if she was facing a lightning strike.
<br><br>"This, this is a top-tier immortal weapon?"
<br><br>Her voice became trembling, and she was completely unable to express her emotions with words at this moment.
<br><br>A top-tier immortal weapon.
<br><br>What kind of existence was it?
<br><br>That was an existence that even in her previous life, she treated like a bottom card, she had only two top-tier immortal weapons in her hands after so many years of becoming an Immortal Emperor.
<br><br>But here it was.
<br><br>One piece was found?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She just put down the hanger in her hand, but then she saw a hoe in the corner.
<br><br>Surprise!
<br><br>Another top-tier immortal weapon!
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>The shock hit her straight in the head.
<br><br>However, one wave had not yet subsided and another wave started.
<br><br>After the hoe, she found seven or eight more top-tier immortal weapons, in the shape of kitchen knives, rake heads, and scythes ......
<br><br>And they were all, without exception, piled up like rags in the miscellaneous room.
<br><br>Su Yunyun was already too shocked to speak, and her body was trembling uncontrollably.
<br><br>She hurriedly withdrew from the miscellaneous room.
<br><br>Because if this continues, it will definitely affect her cultivation.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that after exiting the miscellaneous room, she found many other top treasures.
<br><br>From artwork paintings to placed statues, from household items mirrors to umbrellas, from dog food in the dog bowl to firewood piled up in the kitchen, there was everything.
<br><br>Every single one.
<br><br>All are no less than the existence of top-level immortal weapons.
<br><br>Su Yunyun did not dare to look at it anymore, and hurriedly took a pill and sat down, because her mind, could not bear such a shock anymore.
<br><br>After a long time ......
<br><br>She opened her eyes, and her heart was finally a little calmer.
<br><br>Looked around, the heart can not help but feel.
<br><br>Such a martial arts hall, I really do not know what kind of talent can build ah!
<br><br>Wait a minute.
<br><br>She suddenly remembered something and stood up abruptly.
<br><br>The owner of this martial arts hall ......
<br><br>The owner of the martial arts school is?
<br><br>She suddenly remembered the Heaven and Earth Sect Sect Master who brought her here, the Yi Feng who was dressed in white robes and said he was very powerful but looked like a mere mortal.
<br><br>Since he was the owner of this martial arts school, wouldn't he be, wouldn't he be a super expert so powerful that she couldn't even see through him?
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>Thinking of this, Su Yun Yun Yun's mind resounded with explosive thunder, and her whole body fiercely stunned in place, her whole face turned bloodless.
<br><br>If we recall that when Bones Ben Wei saved her, he once mentioned the master ......
<br><br>These information put together, that Yi Feng is a super expert identity, is already eight or nine is not far.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Su Yun Yun Yun staggered back, straight feel themselves some breathless, in the strong mind shock, a mouthful of blood could not help but vomit out.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>She couldn't care less about the impact of her mind, and her tragic white face was filled with self-deprecation.
<br><br>Because she realized how ridiculous she was.
<br><br>How guilty the brain was before!
