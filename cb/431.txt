Cloud Dancing was just an ordinary family, her parents were doing a small business in Baier City.
<br><br>They were all good people to deal with, and when they knew that Yi Feng and the others were all friends of Yun Dai, they received them extremely politely.
<br><br>"You guys sit here, I'll go cook for you guys right away." With a smile on her face, Yun mother put down the work in her hand and started cooking.
<br><br>"Auntie mother doesn't need to be polite." Yi Feng hurriedly got up and asked, "Auntie mother what do you need help with, I'll help you."
<br><br>"You child, why are you so polite, how can you be so kind." Yun mother hurriedly laughed.
<br><br>"It's okay, I'll help you wash the dishes." Yi Feng directly began to help.
<br><br>Because this kind of happy feeling of gathering, let him like, and dinner can not just eat, have to have a sense of participation ah.
<br><br>"This gentleman has really reached the state of returning to the basics!"
<br><br>"This state of mind, we are afraid that we will never learn it in our lifetime."
<br><br>Seeing this look, the side of the night can teach his daughter night Yi.
<br><br>"Yes, who would have thought that the one picking vegetables there is a super power that can make the North Sea tremble three times with one stomp of his foot!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Mr. this kind of identity, but easy-going, everything is still personal, to be able to know him, it is really three lives lucky." Night Yi looked at Yi Feng with a face full of fervor.
<br><br>"What are you still waiting for, let's also hurry to help!"
<br><br>Night Energy shouted.
<br><br>So the two father and daughter also hurried to find work to do.
<br><br>As for Wu Changan, as early as when Yi Feng was washing the vegetables, he was burning the fire at the side.
<br><br>Under the laughter of Yun's mother, the small courtyard was happy and busy.
<br><br>"Old Night, bring that dish to auntie mother and fry it."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>"Sir, this is the spinach I just washed."
<br><br>"Take it to auntie."
<br><br>"Right Old Night, go and help Brother Wu Tao hold some firewood again."
<br><br>"Right away."
<br><br>With some busy work, a delicious and fragrant meal was brought to the table.
<br><br>The father and daughter wiped their heads full of sweat and said contentedly, "This feels so good!"
<br><br>"Yes, I've never experienced this feeling in my life."
<br><br>"I feel like I have a higher state of mind."
<br><br>"Me too, I have some cultivation enlightenment in my heart, and this kind of improvement is even more important than the improvement in cultivation level."
<br><br>"Not bad, after this time, the future advancement of our realm will be smooth sailing!"
<br><br>The crowd sat down at the dining table.
<br><br>Looking at the delicious meal, Yi Feng couldn't help but ask, "Does auntie have wine?"
<br><br>"This family usually doesn't have wine, so I'm really sorry." Yun mother said apologetically.
<br><br>But Night Neng, who was on the side, raised his palms attentively and said, "It's okay, I'll go buy it."
<br><br>After saying that, he put down his chopsticks and ran out the door with a faint heart.
<br><br>To him, every thing he experienced here was an improvement to his state of mind!
<br><br>Sky.
<br><br>Four figures scanned Baier City.
<br><br>"This sea of people is so vast, we don't have half of that senior's news, how can we find someone!" Liu Gu Yi said with a sad face.
<br><br>Hearing this.
<br><br>The others were also sighing heavily.
<br><br>However, just then, Jian Hengtian exclaimed and shouted, "Look, who is that?"
<br><br>The crowd turned their eyes to it and their eyes immediately glared.
<br><br>"It's that old pipsqueak Night Energy!"
<br><br>"This guy, what is he doing?"
<br><br>Under the eyes of the four people, Night Neng hit a few pots of wine at some tavern, and trotted back with a jug of wine in his arms.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Looked dumbfounded Liu Gu Yi four people.
<br><br>The hall of a ten life martial emperor, has become a human immortal experts, actually ran to the mortal market to play wine?
<br><br>Especially the look of that trotting, like and the city jin Xiao Si, completely without a hint of the appearance of experts.
<br><br>"This guy, not normal ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, what the hell name it!"
<br><br>"Go, go over, ask this guy what the hell."
<br><br>The four people swept out and stopped in front of Night Energy after landing on the ground.
<br><br>"Night family master, long time no see."
<br><br>The four laughed meaningfully.
<br><br>"It's the four of you?"
<br><br>Night Energy glanced at them and said, holding the wine jug and bypassing them, "I don't have the time to care about you guys, sir is still waiting for me."
<br><br>"Sir?"
<br><br>Night Energy's words immediately made the four people's eyes glaze over and asked excitedly, "But that senior?"
<br><br>Night Neng covered his mouth, also immediately knew that he had omitted to say, and quickly waved his hand impatiently and said, "You guys don't care so much, do what you like."
<br><br>After saying that, the night can ignore them at all, jogging away.
<br><br>"This old son of a bitch, still pretending, must be with that senior."
<br><br>"Not bad, otherwise with his cultivation level today, who dares to let him hit the wine, who dares to let him address him as sir?"
<br><br>"Then what do we do?"
<br><br>"Since this old bastard Night Energy wants to eat alone and doesn't want us to find that senior, then we'll keep an eye on Night Energy, in this way, it will be clear who that senior really is."
<br><br>"Good idea."
<br><br>The four people excitedly answered, have cast various concealment means, hidden into the void, watching the movement of Night Energy.
