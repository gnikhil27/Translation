Abrupt sound.
<br><br>Caused the attention of everyone present.
<br><br>Even the middle-aged man and the old man, who were preparing to leave in the distant void, also stopped in their tracks and looked back.
<br><br>Then they saw, in the ruins of the battle, a young man carrying a sack, walking slowly towards this side.
<br><br>As he walked, he muttered to himself.
<br><br>"Originally a person facing this situation, I'm afraid there is a risk of life in ten thousand."
<br><br>
<br><br>"There is a big brother master is good ah!"
<br><br>"This life is expected to become a god, not afraid of the midway aborted."
<br><br>Finished murmuring, subconsciously patted the sack on his body.
<br><br>"Wu Gongzi, it's Wu Gongzi!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"We reckon we're saved!"
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, Night Neng and Night Yi trembled with excitement.
<br><br>The look of resignation on Jian Hengtian's face was also swept away.
<br><br>The people watching the battle from afar, such as Liu Gu, also showed a surprised look on their faces.
<br><br>Could it be that the reversal was about to come?
<br><br>Although Yi Feng did not personally appear, but they all clearly know that this Wu Chang'an is a person of the Green Ox Sect, and also stay with Yi Feng every day.
<br><br>"You are their so-called sir?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi narrowed his eyes at this youth who came from afar and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Oh, I am not."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an raised his head and said, "I'm just his disciple."
<br><br>"Disciple?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's face sank as he said icily, "Is he so afraid that he shrinks from coming forward and sends one of your disciples to die?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an glanced at him lightly and said leisurely, "My master, his old man, has been exercising recently and is dancing in the mountains, so he doesn't have the time to take care of you guys."
<br><br>"Of course, to deal with you crooked people, there is no need for his old man to do it himself."
<br><br>"Hahaha, what a big mouth, you're not afraid of the wind blowing your tongue." Lu Zhengyi's voice was icy cold as he drank, "Sending one of your disciples out to face my Baiyang True Palace is a complete death wish."
<br><br>"Wait, I think you've misunderstood something." Wu Chang'an said hastily.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi turned his gaze towards him.
<br><br>"I'm not here to deal with you guys either, after all, I'm also Master's disciple, so I'm not so low as to come and deal with you guys personally."
<br><br>Wu Changan said indifferently.
<br><br>Then put the sack next to the ground, slowly untie the rope at the mouth of the sack.
<br><br>And while untying the rope, he said indifferently: "Don't you want to see my master's wood carving?"
<br><br>"Immediately satisfy you."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi and the others all focused their eyes on the sack and shrank their brows.
<br><br>Because what made him feel unusual was that the Wu Changan in front of him was too calm.
<br><br>This is facing his entire Baiyang True Palace, it is too unconventional.
<br><br>Self-consciousness told him that there must be a demon in the matter.
<br><br>"Master, don't be compelled by him, he must be pretending to be a god, a broken sack, can't there be anything good hidden inside?" Bai Shanyi said in a cold voice at the side.
<br><br>At these words, Lu Zhengyi nodded his head.
<br><br>That's right.
<br><br>A broken sack, what good things could there be?
<br><br>Moreover, with so many experts in Bai Yang True Palace, he could still lose?
<br><br>It was him who was too cautious.
<br><br>So he raised his head towards Wu Chang'an and shouted coldly: "Pretending to be a god, if you have anything, then hurry up and bring it out, so that I can see it properly, otherwise you won't have a chance?"
<br><br>"Heh."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an laughed at Lu Zhengyi's words.
<br><br>Naive half a day can not untie the bag, the heart can not help but spit Yi Feng tied a dead end after the knot, simply move the teeth.
<br><br>Finally, the rope was bitten off, Wu Changan lifted the burlap sack.
<br><br>"Satisfy you."
<br><br>With the sack lifted, a sack of wooden sculptures was dumped out by him.
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>Hundreds of wooden sculptures were all piled up on the ground, like a pile of rags.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It was such a pile of seemingly broken things, but it set off a big wave.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha, wooden carvings, all of them are wooden carvings carved by sir, indeed, sir has a backhand, all of this is in his calculations." Night can laugh loudly, to Yi Feng is full of reverence.
<br><br>"Yes, sir is sir, always unexpected in critical moments."
<br><br>Night Yi was also crying with joy, Yi Feng in her heart simply became a faith.
<br><br>And Jian Hengtian likewise danced with his hands on the side.
<br><br>"I bet right, Hengtian Sword Fast, to rise, to rise hahaha ......"
<br><br>And Bai Yang True Palace and others, the cold smile on their faces was also instantly frozen.
<br><br>Especially the white shallow one, but also subconsciously hide behind Lu Zhengyi, before that wood carving into the auspicious clouds of black-robed man, brought her fear is still vividly.
<br><br>Seeing the subordinates of the crowd such a state of disorder, Lu Zhengyi hurriedly waved his hand, drinking: "Do not be afraid, so many wooden sculptures, can not all have the same kind of power, probably that person put out a blindfold, want to scam us."
<br><br>Hearing this.
<br><br>Others have also reacted.
<br><br>Good.
<br><br>These wooden sculptures are definitely ordinary wooden sculptures, put out the blindfold only.
<br><br>If these wooden sculptures really have the same kind of power as before, then it would still be?
<br><br>This Immortal River continent must be pushed by this person?
<br><br>"Master, we must capture them alive, torture them fiercely, and finally let them die a good death."
<br><br>Thinking about how she was scared again just now, Bai Shanyi's face showed a look of anger and frustration, gritting her teeth and drinking with a face full of malice.
<br><br>"Don't worry, none of them can get away."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi narrowed his eyes and turned his gaze towards Wu Changan.
<br><br>"Hmph, kid, playing tricks in front of me, Lu Zhengyi, is still a bit too young, I can see through your blindfold at a glance."
<br><br>"No more effort to bother with you, just go to hell for me first, consider it as collecting an interest first."
<br><br>After saying that, he swept down from the sky.
<br><br>With a flip of his hand, a mountain of power covered towards Wu Changan.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Facing Lu Zhengyi's attack, Wu Changan didn't even look at it, but dragged out a recliner from the ruins nearby.
<br><br>"Some people, ah, are always so ignorant."
<br><br>"After being comfortable for a long time, they get carried away and don't know what they are."
<br><br>"Since that's the case, let's enjoy it."
<br><br>He muttered while blowing the dust on the recliner and lay on it head first.
