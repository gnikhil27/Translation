However, the next moment.
<br><br>The scene that appeared in front of them directly touched their nerves, and their eyes almost fell off.
<br><br>Only to see Yi Feng raised the palm of his foot and kicked the black-robed man over to the ground.
<br><br>This kick came down and the black-robed man's head fell around.
<br><br>"Which God damned sneak attack this scum?"
<br><br>The black-robed man broke his head squarely with both hands, while curses came out of his mouth.
<br><br>After he hurriedly broke his head upright, he abruptly met Yi Feng's meaningful eyes.
<br><br>"OMG rash!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei scared soul, turned around and pulled his legs to run.
<br><br>But he just ran two steps, Yi Feng a sweeping leg to catch up, along with a muffled grunt, Bone Ben Wei fell headlong in the grass, and then was dragged back by Yi Feng pulling a leg.
<br><br>"Ooooooooo ......" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei hands left ten claw marks on the ground, and a wailing sound came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Just then, the dog running behind also saw this scene, and was stunned and petrified in place.
<br><br>"Run, run, we can't lose all the troops!"
<br><br>Looking at the dog, Skeleton Ben great shouted out.
<br><br>The dog sniffed, nodded dumbly, turned around and started running.
<br><br>"Wangcai, stop for me."
<br><br>However, Yi Feng shouted, and it scared him to stand in place.
<br><br>"Come back."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved at him again and shouted.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words Ao Qing dared not disobey, so he had to stifle his head, lifting his heavy feet and walking towards Yi Feng's side.
<br><br>"Good you two, I said how come I didn't see you at the martial arts school, so you ran so far and came here!"
<br><br>"Say, what did you come here for?"
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped on the dog's head, and then slapped on Bone Ben Wei's head.
<br><br>A bone and a dog in Yi Feng's scolding, the atmosphere did not dare to breathe a breath, planted his head like a chicken.
<br><br>However, this scene but looked silly Li Shuhua and others.
<br><br>This appearance, this scene, so they could not help but doubt that the sky-devouring demon wolf in front of them is still the sky-devouring demon wolf that killed the Tiger Demon with one claw?
<br><br>The terrifying black-clothed man, or the black-robed man who had kicked Song Ke's body to death?
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>The crowd drew a cold breath.
<br><br>But they also heard out that the black-robed man and the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf were both Yi Feng's henchmen.
<br><br>And if his men were so powerful, then what kind of identity should Yi Feng have!
<br><br>Think carefully!
<br><br>They no longer dared to guess further, only the shock in their hearts.
<br><br>"Oh, what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng grabbed the sack in the hands of Bone Ben Wei and Dog, after opening it, the glittering gold coins shone straight in Yi Feng's eyes, causing an aunt-like smile to appear on Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>However, he quickly put away without moving, coughed lightly and asked with a stern face: "Ahem, quickly, bring so many gold coins?"
<br><br>"Aba aba!"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei lowered his head.
<br><br>"Say something human!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's voice sank.
<br><br>"Pick up, pick up the ......"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei emitted a wishy-washy voice.
<br><br>"Picked up?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>"This time it's really picked up!" Bone Ben Wei said in a hurry.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Bone Ben Wei's sincere appearance, also believed a few points, after all, this deep mountain forest, said they stole at all impossible, I am afraid that really from which mountain lumps picked up.
<br><br>"All right, this time I will spare you."
<br><br>Yi Feng then waved his hand.
<br><br>"That ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei raised his head toward Yi Feng, and the small claws in his black robe quietly reached for the sack.
<br><br>"What for what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped his palm away and lectured with a stern face, "What do you need so much money for a broken skeleton?"
<br><br>"But, but this is what I picked up ......"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei said aggressively.
<br><br>"You picked up so what, I support a family do not want money, you guys only know light mouth to eat, bare arms to sleep, have not thought about how difficult it usually is for me ah, meal money, food money, travel carriage fees, street management fees, are not expenses?" Yi Feng said in pieces: "Besides, I did not say I want your, just that exist here, when you want I will give it?"
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng and looked at Bone Ben Wei asked: "Last time to give you a gold coin how is it used?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei closed his mouth and did not say anything.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him and sighed, shook his head and said, "Forget it, I'll give you another one."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng took out a gold coin and put it into Bone Ben Wei's hand, while admonishing in a serious tone, "But you have to remember to save, it's not easy to live, you don't spend money like water, understand."
<br><br>Looking at a gold coin in his hand, Bone Ben Wei moved his upper and lower jaws and looked up at the sky.
<br><br>Obviously the sun has not yet set.
<br><br>Why does it feel so sad?
<br><br>"Okay, it's cold, you hurry up and get some firewood to burn it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed again.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei sullenly went to collect firewood, the more you think about it, the more aggrieved you are, the more aggrieved you are, looking at the nearby acacia tree, a fist smashed over.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Large dozens of people to surround the trunk of the tree, was hit a penetration.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>Song Ke, who was still secretly hurt by the damage to the Heart of the Tree, who was lurking in the shadows, was hit by this punch, and his huge body was straight up with cold air.
<br><br>The whole acacia tree swayed for a while.
<br><br>At the same time, a fragrant bag fell down, just fell into the hands of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Looking at this incense bag in his hand, Yi Feng's heart astonished.
<br><br>This is not his damn it, how to hang the tree above the head?
<br><br>It's too much of a coincidence!
<br><br>And looking at this incense bag, Li Shuhua and other people's eyes stared straight, gulping, full of salivation.
<br><br>But in Yi Feng's hands, they did not dare to fight for it, and only hoped that Yi Feng would return this fragrant bag to them.
<br><br>Night, gradually fell.
<br><br>Li Shuhua watched as Bone Ben Wei plucked a root from the acacia tree to make a fire, too scared to speak.
<br><br>Unknowingly, Bone Ben Wei and dog lying on the ground snoring, Yi Feng and Zhong Qing have also fallen asleep, Li Shuhua also sitting beside the fire, into a closed-eyed state of rest.
<br><br>Behind the acacia tree, a pair of eyes appeared.
<br><br>Full of hatred.
<br><br>Reluctantly, the heart of the tree energy coalesced and attacked fiercely toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>At that exact moment, Yi Feng rolled over, and since there were always moths flying by the fire, he subconsciously waved his palm.
<br><br>"Pop!"
<br><br>It was with such a wave of the hand that the attacking energy folded back and landed with a bang on one of the eyes on the tree trunk.
<br><br>"Ooooooooo ......"
<br><br>Directly blinded an eye, Song Ke painful, the whole acacia tree trembled violently.
<br><br>This, what the hell kind of divine tactics ah!
<br><br>Song Ke is full of grief and anger, he finally reacted to the fact that he could not be a match for this man.
<br><br>And he was afraid that he had been playing with himself, treating himself as a plaything in his hands.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Song Ke body hairy.
<br><br>Can no longer rise half a thought of revenge, and even want to stay away from this horrible human.
<br><br>Just like that, its huge body slowly moving, slowly moving ......
<br><br>......
<br><br>And for all this, Li Shuhua and others, who had been wary of Song Ke, all looked at it.
<br><br>Can't help but to that youth, the heart has produced a greater admiration.
<br><br>In fact, directly scared Song Ke away.
<br><br>The day dawned, Li Shuhua and others began to clean up, while the fire left behind with the earth layer buried.
<br><br>After all, it is also considered a rule to enter the mountain, even if the cultivator is no exception.
<br><br>Yi Feng up, immediately startled.
<br><br>Because around a large empty block, the big acacia tree directly missing.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>What's going on here?
<br><br>Looked around the people around, not a collective sleepwalking?
<br><br>I can't understand it.
<br><br>After eating some dry food with a confused face, remembering Zhong Qing's training in the past few days, Yi Feng felt it was about time.
<br><br>A group of people, so towards the mountain.
<br><br>"Oooh ...... finally gone ......"
<br><br>And a mountain, a pair of eyes watching them out of the mountain, out of excited tears.
<br><br>After leaving the mountain, they were finally faced with separation.
<br><br>"OK guys, goodbye if you have fate."
<br><br>Yi Feng clasped his fist and was ready to leave.
<br><br>"Eh, senior."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng was leaving, Li Shuhua and the others couldn't sit still.
<br><br>"Why is there something else?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>Several people stammered, finally Yang Tianyu said embarrassedly, "Sorry senior, that incense bag in your hand is ours, can you return it to us?"
<br><br>"Yours?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyebrows instantly frowned.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, it's ours, senior are you able to return it to us?" Li Shuhua looked at Yi Feng and said.
<br><br>These words made Yi Feng laugh at once.
<br><br>Originally, I thought these few people were not bad, but suddenly evil feelings rose up in my heart towards a few people.
<br><br>You say you really want this fragrance bag, say it is, give them also does not matter. But in front of his face open-mouthed, saying that it is theirs, Yi Feng can not bear.
<br><br>"I'm afraid you're mistaken, I'm the real owner of this incense bag!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said to them nonchalantly and left with Bones Ben Wei and the dog.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back as he left, Li Shuhua and the others had ugly faces.
<br><br>But they didn't dare to say anything more to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Patriarch, family head."
<br><br>Just then, several figures flew in, it was none other than Xu Mozhu and Li Renhao who were waiting for them at the periphery.
<br><br>"How is it?"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin asked in a hurry.
<br><br>Li Shuhua and the others hung their heads and told what happened behind them roughly, finished with a sigh, shook their heads and said, "Alas, what can be done!"
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Just then, Li Renhao looked at the distant back, suddenly trembling, mouth sharply said: "This back, this back, this back is not the senior ......"
