The man held a cautious heart and went through a lot of hardships.
<br><br>Finally reached the south shore.
<br><br>The south bank is a huge square, a shadow of a person is not seen during the day.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>There is no his brother.
<br><br>In short there was not even a hair.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"Did they have a problem?"
<br><br>"No, it can't be!"
<br><br>"That strong man who pretended to be a child has been held back by me, there's no way they could have run into any danger."
<br><br>"Yes, they'll be back soon." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Wait, wait!"
<br><br>He had plenty of confidence in his brothers.
<br><br>But for safety's sake, he burrowed into a cliff crevice, watched the surroundings closely, and waited for his brothers to arrive.
<br><br>This wait.
<br><br>It was late in the evening.
<br><br>The brothers did not come, but a large group of women arrived.
<br><br>Gathered together in a square formation!
<br><br>With the music together.
<br><br>They twisted their bucket waists and danced unevenly.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"A bunch of mole crickets."
<br><br>In the crevice of the cliff.
<br><br>The man looked at them with disdain.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>Instead, his eyes fiercely glared.
<br><br>To his horror, he found that as the group danced, there were uncountable amounts of Dao power filling their hands.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This this this ......"
<br><br>"This group of old women?"
<br><br>"Exactly, exactly ......"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before one wave subsides, another wave rises.
<br><br>A group of old men gathered aside again.
<br><br>Some played the erhu, emitting the magic sound of the road, which haunted his ears and made him prostrate and tremble.
<br><br>Some played chess, the moment the chess piece fell, as if a shocking beat, shocked the soul.
<br><br>Others played a slow, ancient fist, seemingly powerless, every move seemed to communicate with heaven and earth.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>Another group of children came running next to them.
<br><br>The children kicked the ball, laughing and smiling, so happy.
<br><br>And the moment they kicked the ball palm force, is actually involved in the power of space?
<br><br>What appalled him most was this.
<br><br>The child, who had been fighting with him for days, sat next to him and watched in awe, saying that he wanted to kick together.
<br><br>Other children said: you are too weak, do not want you to come.
<br><br>You're too weak?
<br><br>?
<br><br>????
<br><br>?????
<br><br>The man had a question mark on his face.
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>A mosquito buzzed past the cliff crack in front of him and gave him a cold glare.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>This glance made the man scream straight.
<br><br>What kind of a look was this?
<br><br>Disdain?
<br><br>And what kind of aura was it just now, emanating from its body?
<br><br>He glanced again, next to the grass a chirping robin actually let him see impervious to cultivation?
<br><br>On the other hand, the seven little wolf dogs playing, the invisible pressure emitted by the body, so he felt so unfathomable.
<br><br>The man involuntarily shrank towards the cliff crevice, retreating to the point of no retreat.
<br><br>His body was drenched in sweat and his teeth were chattering.
<br><br>"Boy!"
<br><br>"What the hell, what kind of a place have I fucking come to!"
<br><br>"Mamma."
<br><br>"I miss home!"
<br><br>He cried.
<br><br>His body was spread with fear.
<br><br>Just then, he noticed a gaze in the darkness that seemed to be staring at him.
<br><br>Turning his head, he looked.
<br><br>A dozen ants whose heads were bigger than their bodies stared at him.
<br><br>"Brothers, come to live."
<br><br>The ant in the lead lifted his foot as if he uttered these words, and then a dozen ants swarmed towards him ......
<br><br>The summer night.
<br><br>It is still so cool.
<br><br>It's just a small bug being eaten by ants, too normal a thing.
<br><br>Outside the Tiandi Gate Island.
<br><br>The exterminator touched the top of his head.
<br><br>Smelled it again, and when he found that it was bird shit, he wiped the bird shit off his hands in anger.
<br><br>"It's been several days, why haven't those nine lords returned yet?"
<br><br>Perisher muttered.
<br><br>But remembering the man's explanation when he left, he regained his composure.
<br><br>"Usually a retreat is decades, a few days only, how can I be so impatient."
<br><br>"Die waiting!"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>He closed his eyes again.
<br><br>This wait.
<br><br>It was a month.
<br><br>"Why hasn't he come back yet?"
<br><br>"Nothing will happen, right?"
<br><br>He opened his head.
<br><br>Thinking about the strength of the nine bits, he put his heart down again, then nodded firmly.
<br><br>"Die waiting!"
<br><br>Another three months passed ......
<br><br>Once again, Perdition opened his eyes.
<br><br>"Hasn't come back yet?"
<br><br>"But we've waited for three months, what's the harm in waiting for a while longer?"
<br><br>"Die waiting!"
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>He closed his eyes again.
<br><br>And in Shadow Island.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was living the life of an idle fish, took a look at his Qi luck point and sat up with a slap on his thigh.
<br><br>"It's done."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly purchased the Dark Shadow Island's teleportation array connecting to the Heaven and Earth Gate at the Qi Luck Exchange Shop.
<br><br>He couldn't wait and wanted to teleport back.
<br><br>While teleporting.
<br><br>He deliberately changed into a new outfit.
<br><br>The teleportation array was activated and the clouds above the Heaven and Earth Gate broke open.
<br><br>He descended to the Heaven and Earth Gate with full force.
<br><br>"Look at La!"
<br><br>"It's Mister!"
<br><br>"Mister is back."
<br><br>"Sir looks like a real high light!"
<br><br>"Yes, the clouds break open, directly walk down, this kind of means, simply ignore the laws of heaven and earth like nothing!"
<br><br>A small number of people who had not long been on the island saw this, and immediately exclaimed in excitement!
<br><br>"What are you excited about, what are you excited about?"
<br><br>On the side, several old men who were playing chess together glared at these youngsters and drank in a deep voice: "Look at you guys, you look like you've never seen the world, how big a deal is this?"
<br><br>"Yes, isn't it normal for such things to happen to gentlemen?"
<br><br>"Look at you all look like stammering."
<br><br>"Boys, we don't blame you, stay here in Pingjiang City and Tiandi Gate for more days, you will know that all the unbelievable things that happen to the gentleman are normal."
<br><br>"Yes, stay for a long time, even if one day see Mr. tear this sky in half also do not have to shout, that may just be Mr. lost the money bag again due to the."
<br><br>Several old men taught.
<br><br>After saying that and play chess by themselves.
<br><br>"General!"
<br><br>"Shit, no, no, no, repent one move."
<br><br>"You dead old man, do you want to shame?"
<br><br>And the other old men and women next to them, the ones who should sell tofu, the ones who sell kings, have no expression for what is happening in the sky.
<br><br>See more.
<br><br>And it is not strange to see.
<br><br>"Rub!"
<br><br>The sky.
<br><br>The majestic Yi Feng cursed.
<br><br>This group of old men and women from the Heaven and Earth Sect, were their brains missing a tendon?
<br><br>He had descended with such a big bigness, but there was no reaction?
<br><br>At least you also came to worship, the gods descend.
<br><br>If not, you have to exclaim a cry or two, right?
<br><br>"Pork Rong!"
<br><br>He descended from the sky and came to the front of Pork Rong's stall.
<br><br>"Hello, sir."
<br><br>"Do you want ribs?"
<br><br>Pork Wing chopped off a pig's front hoof and handed it over.
<br><br>Looking at the pig's hoof in front of him, Yi Feng's face turned black.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>Is it the pig's hoof thing?
<br><br>At least, give some reaction.
<br><br>In front of you guys, how do I have to, also considered a great power it!
<br><br>Not to marvel at the marvel, how he is so powerful?
<br><br>Oh, come on.
<br><br>Failed to play hard to get.
<br><br>He should not pretend in front of this group of old men and women who are slow to react.
