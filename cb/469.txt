However.
<br><br>The woman frowned.
<br><br>"This emperor has actually fallen to become, something that this kind of unworthy clan has vaulted to?"
<br><br>It couldn't be helped.
<br><br>Her eyes flashed with anger.
<br><br>In her previous life, she was originally an immortal emperor, and had fallen by a treacherous person before she was reincarnated here.
<br><br>Originally.
<br><br>She did not care to join these sects at all.
<br><br>But in order to recover her cultivation faster and seek revenge on the treacherous person in her previous life, she was ready to find a sect to hibernate first.
<br><br>I think, with her talent and means, even in this most powerful sect, want to mix a saint as a daughter is easy to do.
<br><br>But what she never expected was that because her body has a hidden physique, the group of blind people in the sect alliance could not see it and actually ranked her at the bottom, even as a candidate for selection was also a passable kind. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But that's not all.
<br><br>For her, staying in a weaker clan is just a matter of taking more time to recover, as long as she hibernates and is not found by the treacherous people of her past life.
<br><br>The actual fact is that you are actually being transferred to another small sect as a plaything?
<br><br>So angry.
<br><br>If she hadn't dared to reveal herself freely, fearing that the traitor of her past life would find her scent, her character would have shot this person to death.
<br><br>"Girl, what is your name?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at her and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The woman but faintly glanced at Yi Feng, more disdain.
<br><br>That Nine Heavens Sect's Sect Master was okay, at least there was that drop of cultivation, this person in front of him was half a cultivation.
<br><br>"The Heaven and Earth Sect Master asked you, did you not hear?" Seeing this, the old man of the Nine Heavenly Sect immediately shouted.
<br><br>The woman's eyes were icy cold and she could not wait to make a move right away.
<br><br>But she, nevertheless, held back.
<br><br>Secretly consoling herself.
<br><br>Su Yunyun ah Su Yunyun, in a previous life you were at least a female emperor.
<br><br>Even this small Immortal River Continent is not worthy of being put in your eyes, now why do you need to be common sense with such people?
<br><br>So be it.
<br><br>Now just find a place where you can quietly recover.
<br><br>As for the specific place, it doesn't make much difference.
<br><br>After all, cultivation recovery is the big plan.
<br><br>Before recovering, it is better not to cause trouble.
<br><br>A trash sect is a trash sect, anyway, in her eyes, it was just the difference between trash and more trash.
<br><br>"Su Yunyun."
<br><br>She said expressionlessly.
<br><br>"Then Su Yunyun, you will join my Heaven and Earth Sect!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun's face was expressionless, did not say anything, and did not refuse, also considered to join his Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>After saying thank you to that old brother of the Nine Heavenly Clan, Yi Feng took Su Yun Yun Yun, Qing Huan phase set off on the way back to Pingjiang.
<br><br>No way.
<br><br>Flying sword can not sit.
<br><br>Yi Feng only had to rent a carriage, and Qing Huan Xiang drove it back towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Ah, Su Yunyun ah, I know, the Nine Heavenly Sect gave you to me, you have more or less emotions in your heart, can understand." Yi Feng looked at Su Yun Yun Yun who didn't say a word and softly comforted, "But don't be discouraged, the Nine Heavens Sect Master is not weak, but I am also very strong."
<br><br>Su Yunyun, who had her eyes closed, opened her eyes to look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>You're also strong?
<br><br>She almost laughed.
<br><br>As for the emotions, there was no way to bounce.
<br><br>From one trash sect to another trash sect only, what emotions could she have, could it be that he thought she wanted to join the Nine Heavens Sect very much.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She suddenly found that the young man in front of her was much more pleasant to the eyes than the old man of the Nine Heavenly Clan.
<br><br>Especially that off dust, always with a faint smile look, it is difficult to let people disgust up, and also know how to comfort comfort themselves.
<br><br>Is a good warm man.
<br><br>To be this emperor future cultivation recovery, perhaps can slightly support some.
<br><br>I think in the future, your heaven and earth door, should be able to get the light of this emperor.
<br><br>This is also considered your good luck!
