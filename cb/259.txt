Came to the door.
<br><br>But found that the door was open.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er bit her red lips nervously and was about to speak when, inside that door, a terrifying energy suddenly came out.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>This terrifying force came, Peng Xian'er found no resistance, and with a miserable scream in her mouth, she smashed through the roof and flew backwards.
<br><br>"Phew, that was close, that was close, that was close."
<br><br>Inside the room, Bone Ben Wei put away his fist, patted his chest and said with a palpitating heart, then fled the room with a gold coin of battle.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Hundreds of feet away.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er smashed heavily on the ground and couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood from her mouth.
<br><br>But even harder than the injuries on her body was the fact that she hadn't even entered the room before she was blasted out with a punch. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>In other words, the plan she had made with great difficulty had failed before she could implement it.
<br><br>And also most likely, had offended that one.
<br><br>"Damn, damn, really damn!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er cursed bitterly with a gloomy face as she braced her injured body and left with a face full of reluctance.
<br><br>But just a few steps later, she took a step.
<br><br>With a sharp gaze, she looked to the side of the street.
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng is bargaining with a hawker on the side of the street.
<br><br>I heard the peddler say with a red face, "You, you, you mean, you buy a pack of fruits from me, and I have to pay you a gold coin back?"
<br><br>"Then how about this, I don't want your one gold coin, it's okay, right?" Yi Feng said generously.
<br><br>"That's more or less the same."
<br><br>The vendor scratched his head, and only then nodded in satisfaction, but Yi Feng carried the fruit far away, and only then did he react violently.
<br><br>"A narrow path of injustice, I really didn't expect that I would run into you here."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er narrowed her eyes at the scene, and a gloomy voice came out.
<br><br>She hadn't forgotten that day at the shore of Pure Stream Lake, because of Yi Feng, she received two slaps from Mao Yun'er and Demon Ling'er for nothing, and it was because of the disfigurement of these two slaps that Yu Wujie had nearly lost her life by kicking her into the lake.
<br><br>Thinking about all this, Peng Xian'er heart filled with full of resentment.
<br><br>Originally wanted to kill Yi Feng with a sword, but after thinking about it, such a shame if not properly tortured and tormented, and how to relieve her heart's hatred.
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>She swept out quickly.
<br><br>Instantly close to Yi Feng, a bundle of trapped bag to Yi Feng set over.
<br><br>The walking Yi Feng's eyes went black, and he felt himself being carried away.
<br><br>A commotion came from the street.
<br><br>But a group of mortals face this kind of thing, they also just feel scared.
<br><br>Inside a dark room, Yi Feng was tied to a pillar.
<br><br>The hood was lifted, and the light that was only faint stung Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>"Damn, am I being kidnapped?"
<br><br>Yi Feng exclaimed in his heart, and it took a long time for his eyes to adjust before he could see a coldly smiling figure standing in front of him.
<br><br>"Hmph, Yi Feng, didn't expect it, we meet again." A teasing voice came from Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"So it's you?"
<br><br>Recognizing that it was this former childhood friend, Yi Feng was slightly surprised.
<br><br>No wonder a mortal like him, who did not have any grudges or enemies with people, was kidnapped, it turned out to be Peng Ying.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he softly persuaded: "Peng Ying ah, this time you are really impulsive, although I rejected you last time, not willing to get back together with you, but why do you have to hate out of love, besides at that time it was you who wanted to leave ah!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng sighed, and then said in a serious tone, "You also know that I have principles, I will never eat grass, so you tie me, I will not get back together with you."
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words directly touched Peng Xian'er's nerves.
<br><br>She really couldn't understand, where did Yi Feng get the face to think that she, the holy maiden of the Heavenly Sword Sect, would want to get back together with him, a punk mole charm?
<br><br>And she kidnapped him obviously to torture him, no wonder he couldn't see the current situation?
<br><br>"Yi Feng, please have some self-awareness, what kind of person am I, Peng Xian'er, a cultivator above ten thousand people, I will think of getting back together with a mortal like you, will you have some face?" Peng Xian'er drank at Yi Feng with a hostile face.
<br><br>"Oh, that's really great."
<br><br>Yi Feng let out a sigh of relief and showed a relieved look.
<br><br>But seeing this scene, Peng Xian'er got even hotter.
<br><br>What kind of look is this.
<br><br>Relieved?
<br><br>Why wasn't he afraid?
<br><br>Shouldn't he show fear and kneel down to beg for mercy? Couldn't he see what he would face next?
<br><br>Well, well, well.
<br><br>Since that's the case, then I'll show you how powerful I am.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er bit her red lips tightly as the Martial Sect's aura surged out.
<br><br>Along with a long hair towering up, the entire aura coalesced together and crushed towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Tremble.
<br><br>Mortal!
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Pang Ying was flooded with a thick cold smile.
<br><br>She had even seen Yi Feng crying out in pain under her aura, kneeling down and begging for mercy, repenting for ignoring her anger.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Yi Feng but sleepy-eyed, even yawned a few times, pressed that file.
<br><br>This scene, look stunned Peng Ying.
<br><br>Yawning?
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>Why was he a mortal able to ignore her pressure?
<br><br>She was a martial arts sect.
<br><br>How did he, a mortal, manage to do that?
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was puzzled and even suspected that her cultivation was wrong, but looking at Yi Feng's sleepy-eyed and yawning appearance, she was furious in her heart.
<br><br>This is simply a provocation to her majesty.
<br><br>This is simply not to put his Peng Xian'er's greatness in the eyes!
<br><br>With a long sword in her hand, she immediately fell on Yi Feng's neck and roared, "Shut your mouth."
<br><br>Yi Feng closed his mouth in fear.
<br><br>But just after he closed it, he couldn't help but open it again.
<br><br>This directly made Peng Ying angry and exploded his hair, slashed his sword on the pillar beside Yi Feng and said with a face full of killing intent, "Are you really not afraid of death?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's head shrunk, said with a helpless face: "Sorry, I'm too tired these days, I really, really can't help ...... ah ah ......"
<br><br>Said, under the eyes of Peng Ying, another yawn.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>A manic voice came out of the stormy Peng Xian'er's mouth, the longsword in her hand shook, and a blasting sound came from the entire room.
<br><br>Then, the longsword landed on Yi Feng's neck again.
<br><br>"You are smart, I am impressed with you, deliberately provoking me to want to give you a pain."
<br><br>"But I prefer not to kill you, instead I want to take you back to the Heavenly Sword Sect and torment you properly!"
