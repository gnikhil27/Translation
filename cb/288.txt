Yun Lang, who was lying on the ground and spitting white foam, stared at him with wide eyes.
<br><br>What was with this woman's words?
<br><br>Meaning that this dwarf is better than him?
<br><br>How is this possible ......
<br><br>But Shui Xing completely ignored him and stepped over his body, standing and stopping at a distance of one zhang from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Those eyes, looking up and down at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>It seems to want to see through Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>However, she could not detect the slightest cultivation in Bone Ben Wei's body, it looked just like a mortal.
<br><br>It is no wonder that this punk at his feet treats this black-robed man as a mortal.
<br><br>But this waste can not recognize the demon pellet, but she can recognize, can put two life demon emperor's demon pellet grasped in the hands of the existence of play, can definitely not be a mortal so simple ah.
<br><br>At least, this impervious to guess the situation, let her water line for a time also dare not act rashly. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Moreover, the way he stared straight at her made her very uncomfortable.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei made a move.
<br><br>This made Shui Xing alert.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that this black robe picked a small flower next to her and suddenly reached towards her.
<br><br>This inexplicable scene instantly filled Shui Xing with confusion.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, what is the meaning?"
<br><br>Shui Xing looked at Skeleton Ben Wei warily, and then looked at the small flower, and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Oh expletive, I forgot to introduce myself."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei straightened his black robe, raised his back and said solemnly, "I am Skeleton Ben Wei, the scum of the earth, to the nun at first sight, send a small flower, hope to spend the night with the nun!"
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>Shui Xing almost opened his mouth wide.
<br><br>This person, is not aware of her strength?
<br><br>In this case, actually tease her, and tease so unlevel?
<br><br>The Yun Lang who was lying on the ground foaming at the mouth wanted to die, this shorty, really fucking unusual, he did not know whether to say admire or should say he made death.
<br><br>Looking at the sincere look of Bone Ben Wei, Shui Xing laughed awkwardly and said, "Your Excellency, don't joke with me in such a non-nutritious way, let's get right to the point, I want that bead in your hand."
<br><br>"So Your Excellency, can you let me have it?"
<br><br>Saying that, she looked at Skeleton Ben Wei with a gleaming gaze.
<br><br>Today.
<br><br>She was imperative for this demon pellet.
<br><br>If this person was willing to give it to her, then all was well.
<br><br>But if he was not willing to give it to her, even if she could not see through his cultivation, she could only rob it by force.
<br><br>"So the aunt likes this bead." Skeleton Ben Wei said, "Yes, as long as the aunt spends the night with me, chatting with me and drinking, I will give it to the girl."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Shui Xing's face changed several times.
<br><br>She could see that the black-robed man in front of her was an oddball.
<br><br>Since that was the case, it would be better to go along with him and try ......
<br><br>"Okay, I promise you, so you can give me this bead, right?" Shui Xing raised the corner of his mouth and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Yes, yes!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said happily, without saying a word, he gave the demon pellet in his hand to Shui Xing, while the flower in his hand did not forget to hand it over.
<br><br>Grasping the demon pellet in her hand, Shui Xing revealed an unbelievable look.
<br><br>She never thought that she would really get this demon pellet in her hand.
<br><br>She originally only tried to follow the black-robed man's words, she had no hope that he could really give herself the demon pellet.
<br><br>But who knows, this black-robed man is really so generous?
<br><br>What an oddball!
<br><br>She was greatly excited, with this demon pellet, she might be able to help her breakthrough.
<br><br>"Auntie come over and sit down, come over and sit down."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei waved impatiently, while moving a stone from the side, patting the dust on the stone cleanly, and waving attentively.
<br><br>"Tsk, it's better for you to sit by yourself if you sit, besides, thanks for the demon pills." Water line raised the corner of the mouth leisurely said.
<br><br>After all, the demon pills have arrived, who really accompany you a strange man to spend the night together?
<br><br>After saying that, she gave a cold laugh.
<br><br>Then with a long sweep, she flashed into the fog and disappeared.
<br><br>The skeleton of the urgent Ben Wei looked at the woman who suddenly disappeared, silly.
<br><br>The whole person, stunned in place.
<br><br>On the side, Yun Lang staggered up from the ground, looking at the already departed water line felt full of incredulity.
<br><br>Originally thought it was a certain death, but did not expect Shui Xing just left.
<br><br>This feeling of survival after the robbery, so good.
<br><br>He hurriedly asked toward Bone Ben Wei, "Shorty, what the hell just happened, what kind of bead do you have that is so important that she actually has no interest in both of our lives."
<br><br>Yun Lang's voice came, the stunned Bone Ben Wei then reacted, he cried out, "How to cheat, how to go away, did not we agree to spend the night together, where is the trust between people?"
<br><br>He touched his heart with his right hand, and stumbled backward a step on his paws.
<br><br>It hurt.
<br><br>What a fucking heartache.
<br><br>He finally realized what it was like to be deceived and hurt by a woman.
<br><br>"Come on, you're lucky to have escaped. You really want her to spend the night with you, a mortal, do you know what kind of person she is?" Yun Lang rolled his eyes and said.
<br><br>But Bone Benevolent ignored him and turned to be filled with anger.
<br><br>"No, damn woman, I said I would accompany me, I have to get her back."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's voice full of anger came out.
<br><br>Palms, lightly raised up, mouth shouted: "Give this scum back."
<br><br>"Cut."
<br><br>Yun Lang gave Bone Ben Wei a white glance.
<br><br>He could also see that this shorty was really a douche.
<br><br>Just by raising your hand, can you really catch Shui Xing back?
<br><br>You think you are a god?
