A punch will Ao Bi Fang killed.
<br><br>The Devouring Emperor felt hot and unbearable, his power was still nowhere to vent, he wanted to look for his wife again, but remembered that she was dying last night, if he made up another stick, he would have to be a bachelor for the rest of his life.
<br><br>So, his fiery gaze was fixed on those experts of the Red Sun lineage.
<br><br>At this moment, under the strength of the Heaven Devouring Emperor Demon Dignity, those experts left in the Red Sun lineage did not even have a chance to escape and were all exterminated by the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>And with less high-end combat power, the rest of the Red Sun lineage immediately collapsed.
<br><br>At the same time, the Heaven Devouring Emperor's power was also considered to be released, and his cultivation level was still at the half-exalted realm, but he was only one step away from being a true demon exalted.
<br><br>The crisis of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>It was finally lifted.
<br><br>"Ao Yun!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor shouted.
<br><br>"Present." Ao Yun respectfully approached. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"In a few days when I finish cleaning up the mess of my tribe, you will take me to my son and, by the way, pay homage to that high person who saved my royal family from the fire!" Emperor Devouring Heaven said with a face full of fervor.
<br><br>"As you command."
<br><br>Ao Yun lowered his head.
<br><br>"Right, also, drive those two trash Ao Tie out of the Devouring Heavenly Son Hall, that is my Qing'er's chambers, even if he doesn't come back, no one else should try to get involved!" Devouring Heavenly Emperor ordered again.
<br><br>Ao Yun glanced at this realistic Heaven Devouring Emperor, bowed his head and left.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"What a nice day!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched his back and walked out of the martial hall, then walked towards the wasteland behind.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>In the wasteland, Wu Yonghong and the others were still diligently wielding their hoes, and when they saw Yi Feng walking, they all greeted him respectfully.
<br><br>"You guys are busy, I'll just stroll around!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile and looked around for a while, although these old men were slow in progress, they were still doing a pretty good job.
<br><br>"Uh, that, sir."
<br><br>At this time, Lu Dasheng came coyly, with a shit smell, not that he is not sophisticated, on the contrary, he wants to get rid of the smell than anyone else, but without the word of the one in front of him, he is half cultivation means do not dare to use ah!
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Uh, sir, that Master Wang, Master Zhang, Master Li's family's dung is finished, do you think I can leave now?" Lu Dasheng asked cautiously with an expectant look on his face.
<br><br>"Oh, really?"
<br><br>Yi Feng took a look at the dung needed in the field, obviously not enough, and if such a good dung picker was let go, where would he find such a person?
<br><br>So, he said in a serious manner: "Look, people should always have a beginning and an end, there is still a lot of manure needed in the field, so you should help me finish it all before you go!"
<br><br>At these words, there were tears in Lu Dasheng's eyes.
<br><br>He titled the first pill refiner in Nansha, in these days has long been driven crazy, the usual kind of high days no longer, but also have to work with dung every day, the mentality is about to collapse.
<br><br>Finally endured the mentality, picking all the dung, I thought I could regain my freedom, but did not expect this one is still not willing to let him go.
<br><br>However, he did not dare to refuse, so he had to nod his head with difficulty and tearfully agreed.
<br><br>Looking at this depressed look of Lu Dasheng, Yi Feng also knew that he was feeling a little low pay.
<br><br>Think about it, the burden of so many dung on so little gold coins, is indeed a little less.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he lifted his head and said solemnly: "Don't worry, you pick the dung well, I won't treat you badly, the benefits are few!"
<br><br>At these words, Lu Dasheng's heart and soul trembled, and his godless eyes were suddenly filled with blazing heat, and he was busy looking his head toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>Quite a look full of hot tears.
<br><br>This, finally willing to forgive himself, and willing to give himself blessing?
<br><br>"Many thanks sir, many thanks sir."
<br><br>He hurriedly nodded his head, full of expectation for Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>This appearance of Lu Dasheng made Yi Feng smile heartily.
<br><br>This guy is really low pay ah, I thought it was a hobbled meat, now contact for a long time actually is not ah, still seems to be quite honest a person well, otherwise it would not be too low pay has been afraid to say out.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng's view of this person also changed a lot, said with concern: "Although you work is capable, but in the future, ah do not be so anxious, every time you are about to fly up the model of efficiency is there, but exhausted body is not good, you see the last fall in the cesspit is not a lesson?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng like a chicken pecking rice like nodding, heart excited to the extreme, Mr. finally considered to forgive him, and also gave him so many words of concern.
<br><br>Really.
<br><br>Too moved!
<br><br>"All right go, other people's dung no more, first burden their own family!" Yi Feng instructed.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng a thank you, and began to work.
<br><br>After all, there is a motivation, so picking a bucket of manure to work more nimble.
<br><br>As long as you do a good job, you are not far from the reward of Mr..
<br><br>He picked a bucket of dung to open the dung pit behind the martial arts school, because of previous experience, he subconsciously skewed his head away.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>The expected stench did not come, but rather with a burst of fresh fragrance.
<br><br>What made him even more incredible was that the cesspool, on both sides, was actually full of flowers and plants, and when recognizing these flowers and plants, Rudasheng's eyes almost stared out.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This this this ......"
<br><br>"This is actually the Zong Pin medicinal herb Violet?"
<br><br>"That's the Zun Pin medicinal herb Ding Chicken Flower!?"
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng pumped backwards, the whole person was like a pillar, standing next to the cesspool pool.
<br><br>These herbs, to their pill refiners, are simply the most precious things.
<br><br>For example, the violet, it is worth a lot of money, enough to make people scramble.
<br><br>As for the Ding Chicken Flower, the value is even higher, just this one herb, can become the main medicine of many kinds of medicine, rumor has it that a Martial Saint expert in order to find a Ding Chicken Flower, do not hesitate to take out the holy treasures in exchange.
<br><br>And in addition to these Rudasheng can recognize, there are many others that can not be recognized, but looking at its character and breath can tell that it is no less than Ding Chicken Flower such existence.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just this kind of heaven defying level of herbs, something that cannot be found by looking around, but grows all over a cesspit?
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>"Why is it like this?"
<br><br>Rudrasheng felt dumbfounded in the head.
<br><br>To grow these things, you need to have the kind of hard-to-find feng shui treasure, after thousands or even tens of thousands of years of breeding, only then may grow a plant.
<br><br>But this cesspit, not to say that it is not a feng shui treasure, even the fertile soil is not considered.
<br><br>Just as he pondered this question, struggling to understand in shock, Lu Dasheng's eyes snapped again.
<br><br>"That's?"
<br><br>The palm of his hand pointed deadly at the pile of dog shit in the pool of the cesspit, and his whole body could not help but tremble.
<br><br>Under the sharp excitement, he defiantly lunged towards the cesspit.
<br><br>At the same time, the round eyes came closer, deadly surveyed the pile of dog shit, while the mouth backwards, the look full of shock.
