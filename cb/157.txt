I can't believe I was defiled by this punk!
<br><br>How is this possible?
<br><br>How could this be possible?
<br><br>This was something she would never dare to imagine!
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>A hysterical voice came out of her mouth, full of anger and humiliation hitting her mind, but under the suppression of the Demon Subduing Mirror, she couldn't exert half of her power, and could only let Ao Qing pound her one by one!
<br><br>A time, unwilling tears flowed down from her eyes, the reddened eyes, filled with a strong hatred.
<br><br>These two humans.
<br><br>And Ao Qing, the trash.
<br><br>All must die, all must die!
<br><br>And outside the door, those black-robed people were Yi Feng thrown out of the door after the cultivation on the body is considered back, originally thought that the saint maiden immediately came out, but found that the saint maiden's screams came from inside. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Their faces changed greatly, their bodies flashed, and they even rushed towards the gate regardless of life and death.
<br><br>However, no matter how much power they exerted, they could not push the door, and could only look through the doorway with anxious eyes.
<br><br>It doesn't matter if they don't look.
<br><br>One look, their brains are all dumbfounded, the mind like a thunderstorm!
<br><br>The holy maiden.
<br><br>Holy Maiden ......
<br><br>The holy maiden was actually given ...... by Ao Qing
<br><br>In an instant, they felt that the sky had collapsed.
<br><br>If the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan had gotten this news, the Red Sun Clan had gotten this news ......
<br><br>At this moment, they seemed to have seen the chaos of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>Because Ao Qingcheng is the hope of the new generation of their Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan, and also the pillar of their Red Sun lineage, and because of the cultivation reason, the demon clan must remain intact before the body.
<br><br>Over the years, Ao Qingcheng has been maintained.
<br><br>See, open the demon secret realm Ao Qingcheng will be able to step into the demon clan in one fell swoop, no longer bound by the framework, will lead the sky-devouring demon wolf clan to a new glory.
<br><br>But do not want to be at this critical moment, but by Ao Qing to ......
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>These black-clothed people who regarded Ao Qingcheng as sacred suddenly let out a roaring sound and hit the gate heavily ......
<br><br>But the gate remained motionless.
<br><br>They could only watch the white sky-devouring demon wolf, being impacted by Ao Qing in bursts ......
<br><br>Each impact of Ao Qing was like a huge hammer on their chest!
<br><br>I don't know how long had passed, they were powerless, before the white Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf was thrown out, lying motionless on the ground, blood tears flowing from its eyes, losing its sparkle.
<br><br>"Holy Maiden!"
<br><br>"Holy Maiden!"
<br><br>The crowd roared and clustered towards her, looking at her appearance, each gritting their teeth and wanting to rush into the martial school to take revenge.
<br><br>"Stand still!"
<br><br>But before the crowd could rush in, Ao Qingcheng, who was lying on the ground, hissed out.
<br><br>The crowd paused in their steps and looked at her.
<br><br>"Take me back!"
<br><br>She said word by word, her face looked like she was about to be cut off from life.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd reluctantly gritted their teeth and hurriedly lifted Ao Qingcheng and disappeared.
<br><br>"I, I actually really put, Ao Qingcheng on!?"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, the dog, even though he was already a sage time, still felt unbelievable about the scene that just happened.
<br><br>He, Ao Qing.
<br><br>Actually really took Ao Qingcheng!
<br><br>I really don't know what kind of stir this matter would cause if it were to spread back to the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan!
<br><br>Of course, he understood.
<br><br>All these chances and benefits were granted to him by the one lying on the recliner in front of him.
<br><br>"Qing ah, you're weak!"
<br><br>And at this time, the skeleton head rubbed up to the dog in a flash and said quietly, "It's only been so long, you can't do it!"
<br><br>"Hey, hey, naturally, I can't compare to brother!" Ao Qing said with a smile.
<br><br>"But talk to brother, just now cool not, quickly say in the end what is a taste?" Skull glanced at Yi Feng, revealing an expectant look, asked in a small voice.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"The aftertaste is endless ......"
<br><br>......
<br><br>The Mighty Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan, settled in the middle of the South Sand Plain.
<br><br>Normally here, no one dared to approach except for the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>And when Ao Qingcheng rushed back with a group of subordinates, in the Red Sun Hall, there were already many people with profound breath sitting at the end, all from the Red Sun clan.
<br><br>"Qingcheng, how come you didn't bring back that punk Ao Qing?" One of the old men asked.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Ao Qingcheng's body trembled, her expression was icy cold, her face covered with frost was filled with hatred, while not saying half a word.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The old man sensed the end, and asked again.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's body trembled sharply, wriggling red lips for a long time without saying anything, killing intent in the body straight up, climbing.
<br><br>"What's going on here?"
<br><br>"Yes, could it be that Ao Qing was not brought back?"
<br><br>At one moment, another voice of suspicion came out from the hall.
<br><br>At this time, the old man who just spoke approached and asked in a soft voice: "Qingcheng, Ao Qing that waste temporarily did not bring back also do not rush, but you, is the hope of our entire Red Sun lineage, nothing can happen half a thing, you tell me, in the end what happened to make you as ......"
<br><br>However, his voice was not completely, then a sudden shock.
<br><br>That sharp gaze, deadly stared at Ao Qingcheng, feeling Ao Qingcheng that is not the same breath as before, the old man simply stared up!
<br><br>"You ...... you you, you actually ......"
