"Li Mo Xie, what are you doing, hurry up and let us out?"
<br><br>In a canyon behind the Shifu Mountain, the place was peaceful with birdsong and flowers, and on the surface it looked like an out-of-this-world paradise.
<br><br>However, at this moment, this place was riddled with dangers, and every step was frightening.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and the others never expected that after leaving from the martial school, Li Mo Xie brought them to this place on the pretext of exploring treasures and plunged them into it.
<br><br>"Li Mo Xie, I warn you, if you don't let us out, I, Chu Wild Lion, will not share the same fate with you." Chu Mad Lion erupted with a monstrous anger and sent out a heavy bellow towards Li Mo Xie.
<br><br>The eyes of Sun Zhuge and Wu Yonghong also flashed with thick hatred.
<br><br>It was completely unexpected that they had been victimized by one of their own.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"Scream, scream, it's useless even if you scream your throats out."
<br><br>Li Mo Xie's eyes flashed with thick mockery and said, "Not to mention going out, it's difficult for you guys to move a step now, this place looks peaceful, but it's actually a heavenly danger, not only is there a natural formation, 30,000 years ago this place was also the remains of an ancient battlefield, and back then those great powers added several more great formations on top of the natural formation when they fought."
<br><br>"Of course ......"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie raised his head, then sneered: "It's not that I didn't add a layer of force, on top of the original formation, I arranged two more layers, so even the gods can't save you guys from getting out."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong three people revealed a strong gloomy look, and their faces became bloodless.
<br><br>If that was really the case, then the three of them would only be able to wait for death here!
<br><br>"Why are you doing this?" Wu Yonghong asked in a pained voice.
<br><br>"Of course, it's because of the Sacred Divine Rake in your hand." Li Mo Xie laughed coldly, "You, Wu Yong Hong, are not as strong as me, you are not as intelligent as me, so how do you have the qualifications to use such a good thing?"
<br><br>"You actually ......"
<br><br>Under extreme anger, Wu Yonghong spat out a mouthful of blood from his mouth.
<br><br>"Bring it!"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie just coldly smiled, and with a wave of his palm, Wu Yonghong did not have any resistance, and the Sacred Divine Rake in his hand went into Li Mo Xie's hand.
<br><br>The divine rake changed hands, Wu Yonghong's body trembled with anger, but there was nothing he could do.
<br><br>The power of multiple formations had not only restricted their movement, but also oppressed their cultivation, so in Li Mo Xie's hands, they were fish meat on a sticky board.
<br><br>But Wu Yonghong was still unwilling, gritting his teeth and saying word by word: "This divine rake is given to me by sir, and I have long made a vow to serve him, you plundered sir's things like this, aren't you afraid that sir will find you in trouble?"
<br><br>"Exactly."
<br><br>"If the gentleman knows about this, you should fly into oblivion."
<br><br>Talking about the one from the martial school, the Sun Zhuge and Chu Mad Lion on the side seemed to see hope, and they all spoke out to scold, only hoping that Li Mo Xie would be scrupulous.
<br><br>"Haha!"
<br><br>But however, Li Mo Xie vocalized and laughed.
<br><br>"What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>The three men said coldly.
<br><br>"I'm laughing at the three of you for being so naive." Li Mo Xie raised the corners of his mouth and said coldly, "To tell you the truth, I am not afraid of him, even the treasures in his martial school make my heart pine for them!"
<br><br>"You actually so do not put sir in the eyes, and dare to salivate sir's treasures, only afraid that you do not even know how to die." Wu Yonghong said coldly.
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>"You guys are right, that one is indeed terrifying, normally I wouldn't even dare to think about it, but recently there is a heavenly opportunity for me, Li Mo Xie." Li Mo Xie raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>"What heavenly opportunity?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong's three people revealed a puzzled look.
<br><br>"Tomorrow, it happens to be a rare cloudy year, cloudy month and cloudy day in my Immortal River Continent for ten thousand years, so ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Li Mo Xie showed a profound and mysterious look and did not say more.
<br><br>However, Wu Yonghong three people stared in disbelief.
<br><br>"You ...... you you, you actually know that lost ten thousand years of the Heavenly Yin Grand Formation, this kind of evil formation, how can, how is it possible?"
<br><br>For a moment, the three people's faces became white.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>"You three pedantic old things, you don't seem to be stupid." Li Mo Xie laughed loudly, "Good, the old man has learned exactly the Heavenly Yin Formation, just I need to arrange the Heavenly Yin Formation around that martial hall, below the Immortal, all will lose their cultivation and still do not know, then, that revered gentleman you are talking about, will be a plaything in my hands."
