<br>"Stop."
<br><br>Seeing this, Old Ancestor Qing Shan took an arrow step over and held Zhu Yun's palm.
<br><br>These martial books others don't know what they are, how could he, the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, not know? Those were divine objects that contained monstrous martial intent!
<br><br>Yi Feng seems casual, but does not mean that they can move at will, so even if this divine object right in front of his eyes, the old ancestor of Castle Peak does not dare to rise the slightest salivation, but this Zhu Yun does not know how to move without permission, is not want to be killed?
<br><br>If you provoke the displeasure of that, the consequences are not conceivable.
<br><br>"Who told you to touch other people's things?" The old ancestor of Green Mountain shouted.
<br><br>Zhu Yun face suffocated, he as the Castle Peak Sect leader, a mortal things, turned over, and what is the big deal, his uncle's reaction is too big, right!
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng could not help but feel a sigh of relief.
<br><br>This old man of Castle Peak's quality is really excellent, so he hurriedly rounded up and said, "It's just some small things, take a look if you want, it's nothing."
<br><br>At these words, the old man of Castle Peak let out a sigh of relief and let go of Zhu Yun's palm.
<br><br>Zhu Yun casually flipped open a martial book. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The moment he opened it, the three big words of Vajra Fist fiercely magnified in Zhu Yun's eyes, accompanied by a monstrous martial intent, and then transformed into a fierce beast and pounced towards Zhu Yun.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun's heart was so shocked that his pupils almost exploded, and he hurriedly dropped his cultivation to block it, but he couldn't block it by half, and the mysterious fist came blasting towards him with a devastating force, as always.
<br><br>"Poof!"
<br><br>Zhu Yun let out a stifled grunt and nearly spat out a mouthful of blood, with a shriveled look on his face.
<br><br>"Hoo hoo hoo."
<br><br>Zhu Yun breathed heavily in place, his forehead had long been covered in cold sweat, and while his heart was filled with fear, he turned his gaze towards the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>The old ancestor of green mountain is also full of gloom, at this moment he is also not good.
<br><br>Because just now when Zhu Yun opened the martial book, he also glanced, but this time viewing the martial book is not the last time, the three words of the Vajra Fist that pervades the martial intent like a raging wave attacked him, but in his deep cultivation, so not as wretched as Zhu Yun.
<br><br>As for why this is the case, I'm afraid it's because of their cultivation techniques.
<br><br>His Qingshan Sect took the yin and soft route, and the previous Taijiquan just fit them and could bring them benefits.
<br><br>The Vajra Fist, on the other hand, is the most rigid fist method, which just restrains them.
<br><br>Of course, it seemed to Qingshan why Zhu Yun happened to be turning over this kind of supreme rigid fist, which must also be Yi Feng's intention.
<br><br>I'm afraid, is Yi Feng to Zhu Yun's insensitive, slightly punished it!
<br><br>However, the uncle and nephew of the two different Yi Feng did not pay attention to, feel a cool breeze came, he got up and said, "a little cold, the two or with me into the house to sit!"
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng then first got up and walked towards the house.
<br><br>"Master uncle, this, this is ......"
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Zhu Yun asked with a face full of incredulity looking at the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>"You ah you ......" Old Ancestor Qingshan pointed at Zhu Yun and scolded: "You are usually quite moral, this time why so no eyesight, do you know, just now you have walked in the ghost gate, almost killed me? "
<br><br>"Uncle, this, what is going on?" Zhu Yun asked.
<br><br>"Still asking me what's going on, can't you still see?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan scolded, "Do you really think I'm brain-dead enough to be polite to a mortal, do you really think this youth in front of you is some kind of mortal?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun was shocked, "But, but he really doesn't have any cultivation on him!"
<br><br>"Humph!" Qing Shan old ancestor snorted angrily and said, "You can't see his cultivation is not that the senior does not have the strength, but your eyesight is not enough, not to mention you, I can't see through his cultivation at all, you only need to know that he is a return to the true through the heavenly power, next to the martial book, is the best proof."
<br><br>"And you just disrespected him, and rummage through things, the injuries on your body, is a lesson for you from your predecessor."
<br><br>"You'd better, endow to remember it."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan taught a lesson word by word.
<br><br>Zhu Yun remembered the fear of the martial book just now, and immediately sucked in a breath of cold air.
<br><br>Do not dare to have any more questions about the words of the old ancestor of Castle Peak, at the same time, his heart is full of fear, looking back, he really walked in the ghost gate ah!
<br><br>No wonder, no wonder his senior uncle was so polite to him.
<br><br>Hate, but also can only hate their own stupid like a pig, did not see it at first.
<br><br>"But senior uncle, like this kind of heavenly power, how can appear in this small Pingjiang City?" Zhu Yun asked again, puzzled.
<br><br>Asked to this, Castle Peak Old Ancestor gaze also became solemn, looking into the distance leisurely said: "I guess it is this senior game on earth, just by our luck to stumble upon, but more likely ......"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan wanted to say something but stopped.
<br><br>"What is it ......?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun lifted a breath, his face tense as he waited for the following.
