"A landlord fight?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Demon Ling'er in surprise and asked, "Could it be that you have fought landlords?"
<br><br>After all, there is no landlord fighting in this other world, and the few who know how to fight landlord are taught by him.
<br><br>"No, no, I definitely haven't fought landlord, even if I fought landlord with sir, it must be the first time." Demon Ling'er's pretty face surged with a flushed color and said with her head lowered.
<br><br>"Oh!" Yi Feng nodded, I'm afraid that Demon Ling'er had heard others talk about landlord, and did not put it to heart, so he said, "Then I will accompany you if you want to fight landlord, just say a time."
<br><br>At these words, Demon Ling'er's beautiful eyes lit up.
<br><br>Never thought that Yi Feng would agree so readily, and in her heart, she couldn't help but feel a little smug about her own posture.
<br><br>"But, this matter of landlord, it's not too good during the day, right?" Demon Ling'er said with a lot of style: "If you want to fight, it is also Ling'er to fight with Mr. all night long, right?"
<br><br>After Yi Feng promised, her courage also enlarged a lot, under the table, a jade foot gently picked up, intentionally or unintentionally rubbed on Yi Feng's thigh.
<br><br>Yi Feng is full of black face.
<br><br>This girl, actually still want to play all night. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But it is understandable, the previous life when the landlord was all the rage, he also all night all night fight, lost tens of millions of joy beans, two days and two nights without sleep.
<br><br>"Okay, you say all night, then all night!" Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>"Yes sir, then Ling'er must accompany sir to have fun tonight." Demon Ling'er sex g red lips gently wriggling, heart surprised, did not expect this task actually completed so easily.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng chucked a mouthful of vegetables after swallowing, put down his chopsticks and said, "Really want to fight landlord, what's the point of two of us? It must be three people, so Yuner girl also come along!"
<br><br>The demon spirit child, whose heart was pleased that her purpose was about to be achieved, opened her red lips fiercely.
<br><br>"Sir, you, you want three people to fight the landlord?"
<br><br>She looked at Yi Feng in surprise.
<br><br>"That's for sure, since it's a landlord fight, it should be at least three people." Yi Feng said with a smile, "Of course, if there are enough people, four people will also work."
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"So mister is good at this."
<br><br>"Li, great."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er said with an ugly, slightly shocked face.
<br><br>"What's so awesome about this, it's supposed to be a routine operation." Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>At that, the corners of Demon Ling'er's mouth twitched, her heart was a little impoverished Mao Yun'er actually got the opportunity to fight together because of this, but Yi Feng had asked for this, where she dared to say anything.
<br><br>"Okay, you guys eat first, I'm going to get a room, by the way, send a junior back to my home to take the props needed for the landlord." Yi Feng was the first to put down his chopsticks and got up and said, then walked towards the counter.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words couldn't help but make Demon Ling'er choke.
<br><br>Surprisingly, props were still needed?
<br><br>This kind of old monster is an old monster, the taste is unique ah!
<br><br>For a moment, she had a creepy feeling, and suddenly realized that Mao Yun'er was also fighting the landlord together, which was a good thing for her instead.
<br><br>She could not help but look at Mao Yun'er and said in a cold voice, "The matter has come to this, let's get to the point, you approach Mr., you also have a plan, right?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er's face changed slightly, but she was silent.
<br><br>"It doesn't matter if you don't say, but I don't care what your intentions are, since the gentleman has said so, tonight are with me to accompany the gentleman to put up a good landlord fight." Demon Ling'er eyes burning stare at Mao Yun'er, said word by word: "Do you understand?"
<br><br>Hearing that, Mao Yun'er also instantly comprehended the meaning of the words.
<br><br>As the Chamber of Commerce Pearl, the appearance may seem soft, but it doesn't have to be a real silly white lotus.
<br><br>"If my guess is good, the landlord of the fight is that meaning?" Mao Yun'er said equally tit-for-tat, "So, now we are putting aside our prejudices for the time being and each seeking our own way?"
<br><br>"You can interpret it that way."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er said, while raising her red lips.
