Seeing this.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's indifferent face, finally a cold smile emerged.
<br><br>In this strength of the lineup, not to mention the martial arts school so few people, even the human kind of half a foot into the martial daddy of experts, but also may not be able to resist.
<br><br>These people, will certainly die.
<br><br>For the Xiu Luo Demon Sect and Voodoo Demon Sect martyrdom!
<br><br>A cold laugh, Ao Bi Fang's own forehead red sun mark also lit up, apparently he is not prepared to stand by and watch, will join everyone to fight.
<br><br>"Prepare ......"
<br><br>Destructive energy brewed on the mark, ready to launch out at the same time, he fiercely waved his palm, about to order the crowd to do it together.
<br><br>Hearing Ao Bi Fang's commanding voice, the crowd of the Red Sun lineage's pupils shrank and all held their breath.
<br><br>At the same time, the attacks in their hands are already ready to move, ready to go, just waiting for Ao Bi Fang's final order to fall, their hands will be the same time the attacks will explode out.
<br><br>But however, Ao Bi Fang words have been to the mouth, he suddenly caught an unusual atmosphere. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>That?
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Martial Dignity?
<br><br>One, two, three, and fucking three?
<br><br>And on top of that, there's a Martial Emperor who is on par with me?
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang opened his mouth wide, as if he was afraid that he had perceived it wrong, and subconsciously wiped his eyes.
<br><br>Finally, he determined that the few people sitting and eating were three Martial Exalts and a Martial Sect, although he didn't know what the last one's cultivation level was, but those four people alone almost made his eyes fall off in shock.
<br><br>"Attack attack attack ......"
<br><br>"Withdraw!"
<br><br>Under the trembling of his mouth, he finally shouted the words out of his mouth.
<br><br>With this order, the corners of the mouths of the entire Red Sun lineage were raised.
<br><br>Did they finally give the order?
<br><br>Then since that's the case, then the little crickets from the martial school will suffer the baptism of death from my Red Sun Lineage!
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>They then realized that something was wrong.
<br><br>A pair of incredulous eyes instantly turned to Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>"Withdraw?"
<br><br>The crowd almost thought they had heard wrong, but incredibly, they saw that Ao Bi Fang had retreated first.
<br><br>While dashing, his mouth was still shouting: "What are you still waiting for, retreat!"
<br><br>This scene, making the eyes fall off the ground.
<br><br>And this cry of retreat, but also simply suffer these clansmen of his Red Sun lineage.
<br><br>Pants are off, actually told them that they can not go on?
<br><br>This is one of the strongest attacks gathered ready to launch, this will be the attack back, so they collectively suffered a backlash.
<br><br>One by one in the sky wow spitting blood.
<br><br>But because of Ao Bi Fang's order, they did not dare to stay, one endured the repercussions of the injury, hurriedly began to retreat.
<br><br>This before and after the contrast, it is difficult to describe.
<br><br>When they came how rampant, now retreating how wretched!
<br><br>Finally, they retreated to the outside of Pingjiang City, the leader of Ao Bi Fang speed is considered to slow down, mouth breathing heavily, a face after the robbery.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang, what the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Finally, someone asked the reason toward Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Bi Fang, didn't we agree to attack together, but why did they say retreat at the last moment?"
<br><br>"Good, we all suffered a backlash, please give everyone an explanation?"
<br><br>Along with the first person's question, the others also sent out inquiring voices towards Ao Bi Fang, hindered by his status although they did not dare to roll their eyes, but their tone was more or less tinged with some blame.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"You think I don't want to make a move?" Ao Bi Fang coldly snorted, glared at the crowd, and said in a deep voice: "But do you know that this martial school crowd is more powerful than we can imagine?"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ao Bi Fang took a deep breath and said with a resigned expression on his face, "Among those five people, one person could not see the depth, one is a Martial Sect on par with me, and the other, there are three Martial Dignitaries!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When Ao Bi Fang's words fell, he immediately stunned the crowd, never expecting that the people from that martial school were actually so strong.
<br><br>Not to mention the three Martial Dignitaries, even one Martial Dignitary is a frightening existence!
<br><br>"If I hadn't used the Red Sun Seal to discover all this at the last moment, then I'm afraid we would have been in bad luck today." Ao Bi Fang sighed and said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd also immediately surged up a cold sweat, a face of fear.
<br><br>And looking at Ao Bi Fang's gaze, there was no more blame, but thankfulness, thankfulness that Ao Bi Fang had discovered the situation of the martial school in time.
<br><br>Otherwise, if the three Martial Dignitaries had moved their hands, they were afraid that the Red Sun lineage would have been directly extinct today.
<br><br>"So what now?"
<br><br>At this time, someone asked towards Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang shrunk his pupils and said with a face full of reluctance: "Martial Hall, we are only able to respect and stay away, but didn't you just say that Ao Qing is not in the Martial Hall?"
<br><br>At those words, the crowd's eyes lit up.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>"Good, bypass the Martial Hall, directly make a move on Ao Qing, first catch him back, I just don't believe that those people in the Martial Hall, will still come to the door because of this waste of Ao Qing."
