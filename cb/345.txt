Wu Changan did not expect that his most powerful travellers' bottom card was also revealed by this person in one word.
<br><br>He was even able to know his course of action like the back of his hand.
<br><br>To be able to know all this, this is definitely not ordinary people can do, this kind of person, is bound to be a super power who has insight into the heavenly opportunity.
<br><br>And in the hands of such people, their death crisis, I'm afraid, reached one hundred million!
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>In front of this white-robed man, Wu Chang'an even if he cowered inside the earth, but also feel like stripped naked general, there is not the slightest secret.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an cold sweat.
<br><br>Even the heart has emerged from the picture, Yi Feng stood in front of him with a knife, a knife stabbed over.
<br><br>The red knife into the white knife out, he Wu Changan on the crunch hiccups.
<br><br>However, just when he was afraid that he was going to die in Yi Feng's hands, Yi Feng suddenly stretched out and said lazily, "I'll leave now, see you next time."
<br><br>After saying this, Yi Feng left the island with his bamboo raft. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Looking at the lone boat on the lake, and that robe hunting white, and remembered that white before leaving that meaningful words ......
<br><br>Wu Changan stared straight.
<br><br>This one, obviously want to slowly play him to death ah!
<br><br>And that phrase next time see ......
<br><br>This kind of words, seemingly lightly and casually said, but in fact is said to him to listen ah.
<br><br>The actual fact is that you can't escape from my palm.
<br><br>"Oooh, big brother."
<br><br>"Don't play me like this, I just want to find a place to live, but I don't want to provoke you, even if I made a mistake just now, there is a saying that the one who doesn't know is not guilty, after all, I didn't know you were so powerful ah!"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an cried, his face was full of ashes, and he sat down weakly on the ground.
<br><br>He looked like he was waiting for death with a sad face, and his own death appeared in his mind over and over again.
<br><br>Thinking about it, he stood up violently.
<br><br>"Ooo ...... death is too terrible, such a terrible thing, I do not want ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, can not die can not die, absolutely can not die ......"
<br><br>He repeated desperately in his mouth, and clenched his fist to cheer himself up.
<br><br>"Wu Chang'an, cheer up, you are a travellers, you have great luck, you have the main character aura, definitely will not die so easily, you can definitely jump out of his palm."
<br><br>When Yi Feng had disappeared from sight, Wu Chang'an dived head first into the earth.
<br><br>After that, he exerted his extreme speed under the ground and disappeared far away towards the area of this small island.
<br><br>After a whole day, he had already vanish out of the range of Nansha, and only then did he burst out from the ground with his head in the dust.
<br><br>"Since he did not kill me directly, this proves that he is not afraid of me escaping and has great confidence that I cannot escape from him."
<br><br>"However, relatively speaking, this period of time is also the only chance I have to be able to turn around, I absolutely can't take it lightly and must seize this opportunity."
<br><br>"So even though this place is very far away, it is definitely still not safe."
<br><br>Thinking of this, he gritted his teeth, and complicated hand seals were immediately struck.
<br><br>Then, from the storage ring, he drew out a yellow talisman paper with extreme speed.
<br><br>"One hundred million replacement talismans, change for me."
<br><br>Finally, as his hand seal fell, this sheet of yellow talisman paper collectively shone with a dazzling light, and then one by one, it transformed into Wu Changan's appearance.
<br><br>"This substitute talisman transforms into a character with my aura on it, and has the exact same appearance appearance as me, enough to help me escape that person's control by disguising it as real."
<br><br>"Give me scatter."
<br><br>As his voice fell, one by one, Wu Chang'an, who was transformed by the substitute talisman, began to scatter in all directions.
<br><br>Some left the ground, some swept the air, some took the water route and plunged into the water, and some hid close by.
<br><br>These Wu Chang'an, all have a lot of strength.
<br><br>Within a few days, it has spread throughout the continent.
<br><br>Eastern victory left more than twenty million, the southern wilderness also went to more than twenty million, the western demon forest also did not leave behind, also went to more than ten million wilderness survival, the remaining thirty to forty million is distributed to the Central Continent and the North Sea land.
<br><br>In this way, Wu Chang'an with his own strength, hard to make the continent an additional 100 million people.
<br><br>Although this more than 100 million people on the way there are bad luck violent death, but for the huge base, these losses are not much.
<br><br>And Wu Chang'an also mixed in this more than 100 million replacement talisman, came to the North Sea land.
<br><br>"In the whole continent, the North Sea Land is the farthest from Dongsheng, so it's already relatively safe."
<br><br>"Even if he pursues to the North Sea Land, there are still almost 20 million of my doppelgangers here, even if he really comes over, it will take quite a bit of time to find my real body, which is enough for me to deal with."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an nodded in satisfaction, his panicked heart, finally, was a little bit calmer.
<br><br>"Then, this real body of mine will continue to find a place to linger next, preferably, one that doesn't attract attention."
<br><br>As he thought this, he just happened to find a nearby town where a sect was recruiting disciples.
<br><br>"In that case, I'll blend in with this sect and become a handyman!"
<br><br>"And this identity is very good at hiding people's ears, expecting that person's strong and monstrous means, it is impossible to find me."
<br><br>After that, he collected his cultivation and walked towards that place where disciples were recruited.
<br><br>Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Yi Feng led a large group of people and rushed towards the island.
<br><br>"Sir, sir!"
<br><br>At this time, a large group of old men and women rushed over with anxious faces and asked, "Sir, ah, I heard that you are going to get the sect to move places, is it true?"
<br><br>"I didn't expect that you all knew about it."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed awkwardly.
<br><br>I didn't expect that he, a mortal, got the clan actually spread out, which was quite ridiculous to say the least.
<br><br>But they were all old acquaintances, so he didn't hide it and said with a smile, "Yeah, there was this idea."
<br><br>The people looked at each other and said busily, "Sir, do you think we can go with you or not."
<br><br>"Yeah, yeah, just let me go near that clan of yours and open a tobacco store?"
<br><br>"Yeah, I want to go get a beef noodle stand too."
<br><br>"I'll go there to sell tofu!"
<br><br>The people looked at Yi Feng expectantly.
<br><br>"This, no, what business can there be in the past like this?" Yi Feng couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Aiya sir what are you talking about, when sir's clan grows up, won't we have business?" An old man said.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, although this city has a large population, but the competition is also big, it is better to follow Mr., to go to do the business of Mr. clan." Another person went on to say.
<br><br>"You guys really think so?"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but ask.
<br><br>The people nodded their heads.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hesitated.
<br><br>Because it stirred up an idea deep inside him.
<br><br>Remembering when he first crossed over, he had an idea to build a utopia of his own, a small city of his own, and he could even modernize the place.
<br><br>And now, with that island and such a good group of neighbors, doesn't this just fulfill some basic conditions?
<br><br>Step back, even if he can't establish a sect, or even disciples can't be recruited, and he can't cultivate in this life, he can still make use of that island.
<br><br>Developed into a small resort, a small town, he became the landlord inside, collecting rent, get two little wives, shamelessly living a small life, seems pretty good ah!
<br><br>The thought of this, Yi Feng heart moved.
