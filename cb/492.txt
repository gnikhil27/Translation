One hundred percent being empty-handed.
<br><br>What kind of odd name is that.
<br><br>Is it an immortal spell?
<br><br>Or was it?
<br><br>But the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor could never get that answer anymore, as a flying sword forced its way straight in and locked onto his chest.
<br><br>And under the control of being 100% empty-handed with a white blade, the Heavenly Spirit Old Ancestor could only watch as the flying sword enlarged in his eyes.
<br><br>Finally, it pierced directly through his chest.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Ancestor stared at him and fell to the ground in response to the sound.
<br><br>A hush fell over the scene.
<br><br>It was filled with disbelief.
<br><br>From the appearance of the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor, to kneeling, to dying, it was only a few words before and after. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Old ancestor."
<br><br>"Old ancestor."
<br><br>"Ah, is the sky going to kill my Heavenly Spirit Sect?"
<br><br>And Yin Tianxiong and the others, whose hopes were once again dashed, knelt down and wailed.
<br><br>"Stop howling, you will all go down to accompany him soon as well."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun retrieved the longsword that was inserted into the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor and locked her icy gaze on Yin Tianxiong and the others.
<br><br>From the moment the Heavenly Spirit Sect wanted to kill Xiao Zhan, it had already sentenced these people from the Heavenly Spirit Sect to death.
<br><br>What's more, that Heavenly Spirit Ancestor also said the words to take their lives in place of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Replacing the master.
<br><br>A trash instead?
<br><br>Such a great disrespectful act deserves to be executed!
<br><br>They should be sentenced to imprisonment!
<br><br>The crowd, who had lost their fighting spirit, was like a scattered sand under Su Yunyun's next attack, unable to put up an effective resistance.
<br><br>As the swords started to fall, Su Yun Yun Yun reaped the lives of Yin Tianxiong and the others.
<br><br>The whole space.
<br><br>The smell of blood was overwhelming.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>All of them, including Yin Tianxiong, had turned into dead bodies.
<br><br>The remaining survivors, apart from those ordinary disciples of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, were only Liu Ruyan.
<br><br>But at this moment, she has long lost her previous noble aura, curled up on the ground, trembling all over.
<br><br>She was proud of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>Her powerful master, her powerful old ancestor, had all died.
<br><br>And the reason for all this was simply because they bullied Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>The more she thought about it.
<br><br>The more powerless Liu Ruyan became.
<br><br>The high and proud her heart could never understand why this kind of encounter would happen to her.
<br><br>Why did Xiao Zhan, whom she despised and even wanted to withdraw from the marriage, suddenly became a figure that she could not reach, not only was she strong, but she also had such a strong backing.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>She was like a clown.
<br><br>Also long lost the hope of living, a heart to die.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Waiting for death to come for a long time, Su Yunyun ignored her, but turned away.
<br><br>Looking at Su Yun Yun's leaving body, she couldn't help but shout out hysterically, "For, why didn't you kill me?"
<br><br>"Since my senior brother Xiao Zhan left you a cheap life, I am naturally too lazy to kill you." Su Yunyun said indifferently.
<br><br>"But, but if you leave me behind, aren't you afraid that I will seek revenge on you guys in the future?" Liu Ruyan shouted.
<br><br>After saying that, she stared at Su Yunyun with a deadly gaze.
<br><br>Hoping to see a trace of scruples in Su Yun Yun's eyes and kill her with a single sword.
<br><br>In this way.
<br><br>It is also considered to find a little bit of dignity that belongs to oneself and find a little bit of comfort before dying.
<br><br>However, Su Yun Yun Yun only gave her an oblique glance.
<br><br>"You are also worthy?"
<br><br>Lightly said a sentence, and then ignored her again.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan instantly sat helplessly on the ground.
<br><br>Her heart was filled with frustration.
<br><br>That cold indifferent look was so disdainful.
<br><br>Herself in her eyes, not even the qualification to make her produce a trace of scorn?
<br><br>Liu Ruyan how Su Yun Yun did not have the heart to pay attention, but came to the side and inclined her eyes to look at Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>"Senior Brother Xiao Zhan, how is the collection of the eighteenth senior brother's corpse bones."
<br><br>"Enlightened senior sister, they have all been collected." Xiao Zhan said.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun nodded, covered her nose again and looked in another direction, and asked again, "Senior Brother Qi Yu, are you done yet?"
<br><br>"Are you leaving?"
<br><br>Bai Qiyu put down the comic book and looked up and asked.
<br><br>"Yes, it's time to go."
<br><br>Su Yunyun put away his long sword and shouted.
<br><br>"Oh, wait a moment, I'll be ready soon."
<br><br>Bai Qiyu said as he wiped his butt and got up.
<br><br>Seeing this, Su Yun Yun Yun couldn't help but shake her head and asked, "You say you, making such a long trip just to pull a ...... what's the point?"
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>"Seems like there's no point then." Bai Qi Yu froze, looked up and asked, "Then senior sister, should I do something more next?"
<br><br>"Forget it, go back."
<br><br>Su Yunyun said rather breathlessly.
<br><br>"Oh, okay."
<br><br>Bai Qiyu put on his pants and hurriedly followed Su Yunyun.
<br><br>Looking at the dull-headed Bai Qiyu, Su Yun Yun Yun sighed.
<br><br>This junior brother of hers.
<br><br>Since he became bald after reading that comic book, although he did become stronger, he also became dull, always with those dead fish eyes demented look.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>Several brothers, carrying a blood-soaked large sack, while chatting, while walking towards the mountain.
<br><br>Left behind.
<br><br>Just full of wreckage and dead bodies everywhere in the Sky Spirit Sect, as well as the many spectators who have long been stunned speechless.
<br><br>Who would have thought.
<br><br>Today is actually the death anniversary of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>And after Su Yun Yun Yun a few teachers and brothers left, the events here immediately spread throughout the Cang Dao Empire.
<br><br>A mysterious sect called the Heaven and Earth Sect has even risen from the mouths of the people.
<br><br>There were even quite a few shadowy forces that began to investigate what kind of power this Heaven and Earth Sect really was.
<br><br>On the edge of the lake in the Makufu Mountain Range, there was a large black umbrella that was extraordinarily dazzling.
<br><br>Under the black umbrella, a reclining chair was placed.
<br><br>Yi Feng was holding a fishing rod in his hand, lying on the recliner, relaxed.
<br><br>But this is far from the island.
<br><br>Can't help it, the salted fish days are too boring, Yi Feng is hooked on fishing.
<br><br>But the damn fish near the island ghostly, as if they know Yi Feng to eat them.
<br><br>So in order to find a good fishing spot, Yi Feng came here.
<br><br>Floating up and down, lying on the recliner Yi Feng eyes a bright, patted the belly leisurely sat up.
<br><br>Fishing rod together.
<br><br>Sure enough, another carp of half a catty in size was hooked.
<br><br>"Today's harvest is good ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
<br><br>Just then, a familiar voice rang out in Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, the reputation of the Heaven and Earth Sect has increased, rewarding fifty flyers."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised.
<br><br>The Heaven and Earth Sect's reputation had actually increased?
<br><br>Could it be that it was the propaganda of that group of old men and women in Pingjiang City, so that his Heaven and Earth Sect's fame increased?
<br><br>I'm afraid it's really true.
<br><br>After all, everyone in his Heaven and Earth Sect, including his master, had nothing to do all day long, so I'm afraid that this group of old ladies were the only ones who could increase their reputation.
<br><br>"It's been really smooth lately!"
<br><br>Yi Feng showed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>The last few days and recruited a few chickens, the number of disciples developed to thirty-five people not to mention the fifty flyers sent out, even after deducting part of the flyers do not come over, the number of disciples I'm afraid can also develop to seventy people.
<br><br>The goal of 100 people.
<br><br>Closer, closer, closer!
<br><br>And embarking on the path of cultivation, is also close at hand.
<br><br>PS: not too comfortable today, tonight on a chapter, tomorrow to make up a total of three chapters.
