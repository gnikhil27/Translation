 "Vajra Sutra?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was a bit puzzled.
<br><br>Could it be that he had misread it?
<br><br>But this monk had the appearance of a senior monk, it was really hard not to believe.
<br><br>Probably, it might really be that he was mistaken.
<br><br>After all, in the hands of such a high monk, how could there be the kind of book he imagined.
<br><br>"Master, please bother to see if I have spiritual roots!" The monk extended his palm and said with a smile.
<br><br>The goat-bearded old man nodded and put his hand over.
<br><br>A moment later, he said leisurely, "Medium spiritual roots."
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha, then I will sit down, monk?" Drinking his hands together, he said.
<br><br>"Sit down." Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The goat-bearded old man nodded his head.
<br><br>With that, the two began to play.
<br><br>And Yi Feng did not rush to leave, but just watched the chess on the side.
<br><br>Yi Feng could see that these two people's chess skills were very high, and they were not comparable to the previous Yin Shengfu.
<br><br>Soon, the game of chess had reached a white heat.
<br><br>The old man with a goatee, who was expressionless, had become square.
<br><br>Then, sweat gradually flowed out of his forehead, and he looked at the monk in front of him with disbelief.
<br><br>He never thought that the monk in front of him was a superior person that he could not imagine!
<br><br>"Seniors ...... seniors, how dare I present myself in front of seniors?"
<br><br>He could no longer maintain his calm, and while looking at the monk in front of him, he was about to get up.
<br><br>"Eh, where are the words of the monk, monk, there is no need to do so." The monk smiled gently, "Just think of it as a normal game."
<br><br>"Many thanks, senior."
<br><br>The old man with the goat's beard sat down again, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and became extra serious at the same time.
<br><br>And the next result was not unexpected.
<br><br>After a struggle, the old man with the goat's beard lost the game directly.
<br><br>He hastily got up and bowed towards the monk, saying with a face full of awe, "Thank you, senior, for your generous hand, the game just now has benefited my junior."
<br><br>"You are very kind, Master."
<br><br>The monk smiled with a kind face.
<br><br>But the goat-bearded old man on the side is still full of awe, as for the matter of inheriting the mantle according to the banner, also turned to shut up.
<br><br>And watching the lively Yi Feng is also ready to get up and leave.
<br><br>Of course, he could see that the monk's chess skill is indeed much better than the old man, and just now in the game of chess, he also gave the old man water.
<br><br>But at that moment, the monk, who was sitting on his back, suddenly shouted at him, "Do you want to play with the poor monk?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up, in fact, he has long been itching to play, the key is this monk's chess skill is still very high ah!
<br><br>"Really can?"
<br><br>He hastily asked.
<br><br>"Of course you can."
<br><br>The monk smiled gently and said.
<br><br>After getting the monk's consent, Yi Feng looked at the goat-bearded old man again.
<br><br>After all, this was his place.
<br><br>"Of course it's no problem."
<br><br>Seeing this, the goat-bearded old man hurriedly spoke out, after all, the monk had agreed, so how could he dare to disagree?
<br><br>And look at the monk's gaze, also full of admiration.
<br><br>This is the true return to the real high people ah!
<br><br>Even in the face of such mortals without spiritual roots, but still able to do the same treatment.
<br><br>I really don't know what kind of luck this mortal with no spiritual roots has had to actually get the favor of this senior.
<br><br>After Yi Feng sat down, the two began to play against each other.
<br><br>After the opening game, both of them were mainly probing.
<br><br>"What do you think about life, monk?"
<br><br>While playing chess, the monk suddenly asked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Life?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed, a senior monk is a senior monk, he actually talked to him about such a profound topic.
<br><br>While putting the chess pieces down, he said, "If you talk about the high level, you will explore why I am here, what the true meaning of life is, where I came from and where I am going ......"
<br><br>"But according to my ideas, I'm just a layman, my view of life, well ......" Slightly thoughtful, Yi Feng laughed: "Just do it in time and have fun."
<br><br>"Of course everyone's view of life is different, for my ideas, you can say I am a salted fish."
<br><br>"Then I am indeed, a salted fish."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>After hearing that, the monk nodded thoughtfully.
<br><br>He seemed satisfied with what Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"By the way."
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng suddenly remembered something and said in a hurry, "I always feel that you look familiar, I always feel that I have seen you somewhere."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The monk's hand subconsciously trembled, and then said in a serious manner, "No, monk, you remember wrong, you must not have seen me before."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>The two people's chess, so unhurriedly played, completely without the previous state of killing each other.
<br><br>This, on the other hand, made the old man with the goatee look confused.
<br><br>Perhaps.
<br><br>Maybe this monk is intentionally giving way to this mortal!
<br><br>Can't help but, sheep bearded old man look at the monk's gaze more respect.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was that the monk suddenly said at this moment: "Master is really skillful in chess, this game, is to lose again."
<br><br>"I'm flattered!"
<br><br>Yi Feng arched his hand and smiled.
<br><br>This scene made the old man with the goatee next to him directly confused.
<br><br>This game of chess, it was clear that there was no winner yet!
<br><br>Even from his gaze, the monk even had a slight upper hand.
<br><br>What the hell was going on here?
<br><br>Suddenly lost?
<br><br>Even if this senior monk let the water out and deliberately wanted this mortal to win, it was not this way!
<br><br>The point is that the mortal's face, but also a look of deserved?
<br><br>Yi Feng had a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>Just now this game, he played a very happy and comfortable. The surface seems nothing, the game of two people is actually very dangerous.
<br><br>The reason why the monk said he lost is because he did lose.
<br><br>The opening simple game, the two sides of each other's strength has long been understood, and the master of the game, a small disparity can determine the winner.
<br><br>And just now, Yi Feng is a move to the monk's front.
<br><br>And it is such a move, the monk understood in his heart, want to break back this game has been unable to return.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>The subsequent chess, there is no need to continue.
<br><br>Just at this time, a familiar voice rang in Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, chess skill has reached a level comparable to that of a god."
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, completed the task of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting, obtained the mount reward slowly one, has been delivered to the martial arts hall, please host acceptance ......"
