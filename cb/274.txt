What the hell?
<br><br>Skull head?
<br><br>Ye Wuchen was so scared that he almost had a heart attack.
<br><br>What made him feel more scared ...... was that the skull head actually smiled at him.
<br><br>This smile, so Ye Wuchen scalp numb, a bad feeling in the heart.
<br><br>Sure enough, a cold kick landed in the middle of Ye Wuchen's thigh.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen straightened up with a chill as an unprecedented pain came from the bottom of his foot and climbed up to his head.
<br><br>Miserable screams spread throughout the entire Ye Family.
<br><br>When the people of the Ye family rushed back, the culprit had long since run out of sight, and had taken dozens of gold coins from the room with him.
<br><br>"Woo, my mother has been replaced, quick, go find it for me, and the ones I met when I picked up the bride, I'm sure they're not to blame either, blockade the whole Hanchang City for me." Ye Wuchen bowed while screaming miserably, while hissing ...... Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>That day, countless experts of the Ye family were sent out.
<br><br>"Humph, dare to hurt my son, I'll see where you escape."
<br><br>Ye Huai.
<br><br>The family head of the Ye family, also Ye Wuchen's father, and also the strongest expert of the Ye family, led people to chase out at this moment.
<br><br>He had countless eyes throughout Hanchang City.
<br><br>He soon found out about Yi Feng's group of people and eventually caught up with Yi Feng and the others in a remote place in the west of the city.
<br><br>"Give me death!"
<br><br>Ye Huai raised the air and cut out a stunning sword.
<br><br>"Run."
<br><br>"What a strong sword."
<br><br>"The experts are quick to strike, this is the Ye Family's Martial Spirit rushing over."
<br><br>Seeing this earth-shattering sword, old man Wang and Pork Rong with a group of South Sand's sect leaders pissed their pants and sent out a cry for help towards Jian Wuxin who was pressing the formation.
<br><br>The corners of Jian Wuxin's mouth twitched as he looked at this group of big shots who were pissing their pants.
<br><br>What a damn good pretender.
<br><br>But he did not dare to be ambiguous, and then swept into the air with his sword to meet Ye Huai.
<br><br>In less than a moment, Ye Huai was knocked away by him.
<br><br>Obviously, the same martial spirit, coming from a big clan is really different.
<br><br>"Retreat."
<br><br>Ye Huai knew that he was no match, and instantly lost his previous hardness, leading his people to run away directly.
<br><br>"A master is a master, powerful."
<br><br>Yi Feng gave a thumbs up towards Jian Wuxin, I have to say, this martial spirit expert is really strong.
<br><br>Hateful ah.
<br><br>It's his damn system that doesn't compete, otherwise he would be able to be that strong!
<br><br>"Oh, average, average."
<br><br>Jian Wuxin gritted his teeth to hold back his trembling body, so he put on a rather calm posture and responded.
<br><br>Withdrawing from Hanchang City without any danger, Yi Feng and the others rested in a secret place.
<br><br>"Alas, today's trip, although a successful success, but killed a few innocent people ah!" Yi Feng thought of the few people Ye Wuchen had killed and felt quite guilty in his heart.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The crowd has cast a look of admiration towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Sir really had a great compassionate heart, the death of those crickets they did not even put in their eyes, but did not think that sir was so nagging.
<br><br>Just then, a figure swept in from the darkness.
<br><br>"Father."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Mengtian rushed to greet him with tears streaming down his face.
<br><br>It was obvious.
<br><br>The person who came was none other than Yun Sheng.
<br><br>Originally, Yi Feng wanted to grab the person and run away, but after learning the story from Yun Mengtian, Yi Feng realized that he had almost pitted this in-laws.
<br><br>"Yun family master, I'm really sorry, I didn't even discuss with you before ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng was filled with sweat.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, where is this coming from."
<br><br>Yun Sheng also said guiltily: "Speaking of which I would like to thank you guys, I have long wanted to plan the escape of Meng Tian, but have not been able to make up my mind, but you guys directly helped me to complete the ah!"
<br><br>"Father, but, but what about you guys when I'm gone?" Yun Mengtian asked with tears streaming down his face.
<br><br>"Yes Yun family master, how about leaving together?" Yi Feng also said the same.
<br><br>"Alas, my Yun family has stayed in Hanchang City for generations, how can we leave."
<br><br>Yun Sheng shook his head, stroked Yun Mengtian's hair, and said softly, "Meng'er, it's my father who is useless, not strong enough to protect you, but now it's better, I'm still very relieved to leave you to this kid."
<br><br>Saying that, he turned his gaze to Zhong Qing who was on the side.
<br><br>"Don't worry, I will definitely take good care of Meng'er." Zhong Qing said with a firm expression."
<br><br>"Good, I trust you."
<br><br>Yun Sheng had a relieved look on his face.
<br><br>He then hugged his fist towards the crowd and prepared to leave.
<br><br>"Father."
<br><br>But the tear-stained Yun Mengtian simply did not want to let Yun Sheng leave, and pulled Yun Sheng's palm with a deadly grip.
<br><br>"Child, you do not need to worry about me, you know clearly in your heart, our Yun family has developed for so many years, and is not a soft persimmon." Yun Sheng softly comforted, "Even if we really want to fight, our Yun family is not necessarily weaker than the Ye family."
<br><br>But Yun Mengtian still wouldn't let Yun Sheng leave.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng on the side also rose in doubt and asked, "Yun family master, since the strength of the Yun family is not weaker than the Ye family, then why is it still so afraid of the Ye family ......"
<br><br>"This is not something that has not been told to you before."
<br><br>Yun Sheng sighed.
<br><br>"It's that little captain who joined the Whatzhuang?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Yes, blowing snow mountain village." Yun Sheng answered.
<br><br>"Clang."
<br><br>On the side, the two fifth Tianming father and son who were fetching water at Yi Feng's order, fell on their asses and smashed their bowls on the ground.
