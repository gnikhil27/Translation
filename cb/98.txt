So Yi Feng grabbed him, in Ye Bei's fearful eyes, directly broke his arm, and then threw it heavily on the ground.
<br><br>Ye Bei's heart was a color of death.
<br><br>Yi Feng's attack, even if he used all his cultivation, but the hit on him would still be real pain, already lying on the ground dying.
<br><br>"Senior, yes, it's my fault, please let me go."
<br><br>He said in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>With a face full of remorse, he begged for mercy.
<br><br>"Let you go?"
<br><br>Yi Feng coldly walked over and stepped on Ye Bei's body with two more feet, seeing that the demoralization was almost over, Yi Feng was ready to think about how to settle this guy without staining his blood when a sound of crashing to the ground came from the inner room.
<br><br>"Disciple?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, his face immediately showed anxious color.
<br><br>After a glance at Ye Bei and a look at his clothes, he hesitated for a moment before saying in a deep voice: "Fried Heaven, got, I remember, let you off the hook for now, but in a few days, I will personally come to your door to find you." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng did not pay attention to Ye Bei again, and hurried towards the house.
<br><br>After all, the monk can't run away from the temple, since this bastard came to the door to kick the museum, then he must take a time to kick back.
<br><br>But right now, this waste is more important than Zhong Qing, certainly Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Sure enough, when he walked into the inner room, Zhong Qing had already woken up, but his consciousness was not particularly clear, and he rolled off the bed at the same time.
<br><br>Yi Feng picked him up heartily and put him back on the bed.
<br><br>And seeing Yi Feng leave, Ye Bei's heart that was stuck in his throat, it was like it turned into something, not caring about the injuries on his body, pulled his legs and ran.
<br><br>But he was so badly injured that he just swept up and smashed on the ground, but not half a second later, he flew up again, rising and falling to flee towards the outside of Ping General City.
<br><br>When he returned to the Sky Blast Gang, even with his Martial Emperor cultivation, he was about to be deflated.
<br><br>He hurriedly took two pills to slightly recover his injuries, and without bothering to take a rest, he rushed towards the direction where the great formation was located.
<br><br>"Sovereign, you are really strong!"
<br><br>Just then, three people rushed over in the direction where Ye Bei was, and they were the three great martial spirits from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>The three escaped under the old ancestor Qingshan due to the cultivation of secret arts, and after returning to the Explosive Heavenly Gang, they were reborn, and although their faces still looked weak, the three were indeed resurrected.
<br><br>"Look at those wretched looks of Lu Qingshan and the others, what a relief!"
<br><br>"Haha, that's right, when they've been tortured by the big formation and don't look like human beings anymore, then bring them out, I'll torture them severely."
<br><br>"Good, especially listening to Lu Qingshan said, there is a kid named Yi Feng behind, this matter is because of him, this revenge absolutely must be revenged, when there is a chance, I will definitely thirst for his flesh and blood."
<br><br>"But, thanks to the patriarch!"
<br><br>The three of them had a cold smile on their faces, spitting out their hatred with abandon, while not forgetting to praise Ye Bei on the side.
<br><br>"Someone, arrest the three of them for me."
<br><br>However, Ye Bei suddenly burst into flames and burst out in fury.
<br><br>"Sovereign, you you you, why are you doing this?"
<br><br>The three martial spirits instantly changed their faces and looked at Ye Bei with disbelief, but they had just been reborn, their strength had not recovered at all, and they were directly captured.
<br><br>"Still asking what's going on? ......"
<br><br>As soon as he heard this, Ye Bei became more and more on fire, his gloomy eyes stared at the three, and a deep voice came out.
<br><br>If the three of them did not cause this matter, how would they head iron run to that small martial arts school to be humiliated, and almost lost their lives?
<br><br>Of course, the most frightening to Ye Bei, or Yi Feng's last words.
<br><br>Soon, he will come to the door.
<br><br>Once this happens, the Sky Blasters will cease to exist.
<br><br>The more he thought about it, the more angry he was, Ye Bei waved his palm and directly tore the palms of the three people, allowing the three people to let out a harsh scream, and soberly shouted: "Temporarily detain the three of them, later on, listen to my order to bring them over."
<br><br>Saying that, Ye Bei hurried towards the big formation.
<br><br>Seeing Ye Bei appear, Lu Qingshan stared at him with hatred, revealing a hateful gaze.
<br><br>Searching his memory, this was a great shame to him.
<br><br>What is even more unbearable is that this person also insulted Mr., which is unbearable.
<br><br>But he also knew in his heart that he was now a prisoner, and there was no hope for revenge, so he coldly shouted, "Ye Bei, if you want to kill, just kill, no need to torture us like this."
<br><br>However, Ye Bei changed his normal state.
<br><br>That cold face, under the incredible gaze of the crowd, suddenly revealed a flattering smile.
<br><br>"Aiya, Old Brother Qingshan, what are your words, this is all a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding."
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>"Someone come, hurry up and remove the big formation and let the brothers of the Castle Peak Sect out!"
<br><br>Such a scene immediately caused the old ancestor of Castle Peak and others to stare in disbelief!
