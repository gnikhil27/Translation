 Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Except for the top management of the Chamber of Commerce, Mao Lin sat at the top with a gloomy and frightening face.
<br><br>"President hurry up and think of a solution!"
<br><br>At this time, one of the top brass finally couldn't sit still and came out and said, "As we all know, a city can only have one first-class chamber of commerce, and now it's just at the juncture of the chamber's grading ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, President."
<br><br>Another senior officer came out and said, "Our competition with Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce could have been comparable, even more so than Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce in the market development of gold, silver and cultivator goods, but now Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce relies on a book, this month's revenue is 20% higher than our Ping Jiang Chamber of Commerce, if this is still the case next month, then this first-class chamber of commerce title, we can only give it up."
<br><br>"Not bad, then in the future we will only be able to look at the eyes of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, even the pricing of items and the selection of the market will be given priority by them." Another person came out and said.
<br><br>For a while, the entire crowd in the conference hall was worried.
<br><br>This made the face of Mao Lin, who was sitting at the top, even more gloomy, and his palms gripped the seat even more clicked.
<br><br>He originally thought that Yi Feng's broken book could sell two copies, all thanks to his help, but who would have thought that in the blink of an eye, it would be a big fire in the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>This is not only that, but also make the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce rely on this book, the profits directly over his Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce twenty percent. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"President, I heard before, it seems that the original author of this book, came to you before?" At this time, a senior asked toward Mao Lin.
<br><br>Mao Lin raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>It was okay not to mention this, mentioning this he almost had a heart attack.
<br><br>Yes, it was obvious that Yi Feng came to him first, but he gave up the way to get rich, which was even worse than the death of his wife.
<br><br>At once, his face was embarrassed, and he coughed twice before waving his hand and saying, "Gentlemen, don't worry, what has not happened to our Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce since it was established? I will start to solve this matter."
<br><br>"Dare to ask the president how to solve it?"
<br><br>Someone asked.
<br><br>Obviously, although Mao Lin as the president of the Chamber of Commerce, but the Chamber of Commerce is not his alone, this matter is already caused by the crowd's questions.
<br><br>"That author and I have some friendship with him, big deal, I will go to talk to him again and ask him to return to my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce published." Mao Lin said with an ugly face.
<br><br>"President, people just started to seek cooperation with our Chamber of Commerce, we do not want him, and now ask him to come back, is it so easy?" One of them asked.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, a worried look welled up on the faces of the others as well.
<br><br>So said, Mao Lin's face is also not good, but things have come to this, even if it is not easy he must find a way to pull Yi Feng back, or the Chamber of Commerce senior question, he, the Chamber President can not stand ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, he waved his hand and said: "This you do not have to worry about, I said I still have some friendship with him, will let him come back, you can rest assured!"
<br><br>"I hope so."
<br><br>Since Mao Lin had said so, the Chamber of Commerce crowd could only choose to believe it for the time being, and only then did the meeting adjourn.
<br><br>Pingjiang City after the Shogun Mountain.
<br><br>The outermost peak, where there is a courtyard, courtyard next to a waterfall of a hundred feet, rushing unloading force condensed out of a crystal-clear water pool, water pool next to the emerald smoke curling, and another garden.
<br><br>On the jade stone, a woman in white hand stroking the long zither is dazzling sound of the zither, attracting birds and flowers, like a fairyland on earth.
<br><br>"Miss, Miss, great joy."
<br><br>At that very moment, a maid ran over with a face full of surprise.
<br><br>"Mao Mao, didn't I tell you not to rush into things." The white-clothed woman looked at the maid who rushed over with no good grace and softly lectured.
<br><br>"Miss, it's him who has a new book out." Mao Mao waved her arm, holding a book in her hand and shouted.
<br><br>"He?"
<br><br>"The author of Dream of the Red Chamber?"
<br><br>The woman in white sniffed and hurriedly got up and ushered towards Mao Mao, "Quick Mao Mao, show it to me quickly."
<br><br>"Hum Miss, you still say I am anxious, you see you are not more anxious than me?" Mao Mao pouted with her little red lips pouting.
<br><br>"You still dare to talk back, quickly, prepare a seat and tea for me, and, nothing to disturb me." The white-clothed woman hastily instructed her maid Mao Mao.
<br><br>A cup of tea, a sit, the woman in white picked up the book is a day, from the morning directly to see the evening.
<br><br>At this moment, she has long finished reading.
<br><br>But holding the book for a long time did not slow down, eyes full of empty, seems to be still in the love of the two supreme treasure, has not come out.
<br><br>"If I were given a chance to start over, I would say to you that I love you, and if I had to add a deadline, I would want it to be 10,000 years ......"
<br><br>"Such a sentence ......"
<br><br>"What kind of person is able to write it?" The woman in white murmured softly.
<br><br>Seeing this, Mao Mao rose her small mouth and said, "Miss, look at you like this again, last time the Dream of the Red Chamber made you waste your sleep and forget to eat, this time is good, even the eyes are demented."
<br><br>"You little ninny, how dare you talk back." The woman in white drinks lightly, carefully holding the Supreme Treasure in her hands, red lips slightly moved and said, "A Dream of the Red Chamber, a Supreme Treasure, Mao Mao you say, this gentleman must be a very gentle person, right, what do you think he looks like?"
<br><br>After saying that, her crystal eyes flashed and became a longing face.
<br><br>"I don't know."
<br><br>Mao Mao shook her head in distress.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>A delicate sigh filled with melancholy.
<br><br>Knock, knock, knock!
<br><br>Just then, a knock sounded on the door.
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>The woman in white frowned.
<br><br>Mao Mao also full of doubts, they this place, but never come to people ......
