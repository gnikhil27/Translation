"Is it a person?"
<br><br>"Or a youth?"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng's pupils shrunk into pinholes, and he couldn't help but open his mouth wide.
<br><br>He had many speculations about this mysterious existence that penetrated his Heavenly Sword Mountain formation, such as a mutated demonic beast from the Prisoner Dragon Domain, a spiritual object derived from the formation by some reason.
<br><br>In short, all kinds of ideas he had.
<br><br>Only.
<br><br>Did not think he was a person.
<br><br>And also a young man.
<br><br>Then how on earth did he appear in the formation?
<br><br>Right in between his thoughts, Yi Feng first looked around and then dropped his gaze on him.
<br><br>At this moment, Ye Tiansheng's nerves were tense and fidgety. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because no matter how much he observed, he could not see the depth of the youth in front of him.
<br><br>Ordinary as if a mortal.
<br><br>However, the ability to cross out from the huge network of various formations, can be a mortal?
<br><br>Definitely not.
<br><br>It only means that the youth in front of him is so strong that he still can't get a glimpse of it, even though he, Ye Tian Sheng, has tried his best.
<br><br>"Finally came out ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed with emotion, looking at the calmness of the place, there was an old man and a thatched house, so he must have gotten out of the range of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>However, he also had to admire the Heavenly Sword Sect's ghostly work and amazing handiwork, so many glass walls, and the place where the beast was kept before, I really don't know how much money it took to build it.
<br><br>At least this kind of handicraft construction, he had not seen in his previous life.
<br><br>Of course, Yi Feng also did not think, this is not the kind of xuan-fantasy novel formation or taboo or something, right?
<br><br>But after thinking about it, it was rejected.
<br><br>After all, it is written in the book that the formations and taboos are dangerous, and he a mortal not only walked out, but also half of the danger, obviously this can not be a formation or something.
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of relaxation, after looking at the old man, then walked towards the old man.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng saw Yi Feng walking, his body tensed up violently.
<br><br>Cold sweat dripped.
<br><br>What is he going to do?
<br><br>Is he going to make a move on me?
<br><br>What should I do, should I fight back, but is it useful to fight back?
<br><br>How about ...... kneeling down and begging for mercy?
<br><br>His heart turned fast, the surface seems to have half a move, but the heart has long been panicked into a group, the back has long been wet with cold sweat.
<br><br>So nervous so nervous ......
<br><br>But be calm, calm!
<br><br>Can't let him see that I'm afraid of him, because I'm the last line of defense for the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>Yes, yes, yes, I'm not afraid I'm not afraid ......
<br><br>"Old man, are you having a stroke?"
<br><br>Finally, Yi Feng arrived in front of Ye Tian Sheng and looked at his trembling legs and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Hearing this, Ye Tian Sheng looked down, only to find that his legs simply could not help but tremble.
<br><br>It's over.
<br><br>He saw that I was panicking.
<br><br>But I really can not help it, really have not seen such a powerful existence ah!
<br><br>Huh, not right.
<br><br>But he quickly reacted, Yi Feng did not mean to make a move on him, but instead spoke very gently.
<br><br>What's going on here?
<br><br>He was full of confusion.
<br><br>This person penetrated the formation to come here, didn't he come to destroy the last line of defense of his Heavenly Sword Sect?
<br><br>During his confusion, Yi Feng reached out to hold him.
<br><br>At this moment, Ye Tian Sheng was once again stuck in his throat, so scared that he thought he was going to die, but was surprised to find that Yi Feng did not strike at him, but instead helped him to the stone bench of the thatched roof next to him.
<br><br>God.
<br><br>What in the world is this person going to do?
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng trembling to sit down, feeling buttocks sitting on the stool full of needles.
<br><br>Because from the way this one broke his Heavenly Sword Sect's Spirit Gathering Formation and Dragon Prison Domain, it was obvious that he was here to destroy his Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>But in contrast to his current actions, it is too counterintuitive, it really makes Ye Tian Sheng feel unusually uncomfortable.
<br><br>Big brother.
<br><br>Please do not play me ah.
<br><br>To kill to death you understand the point, even if you want to die can also die a pain, so teasing him a little old man, the heart really can not bear ah.
<br><br>"Old man, this should not be the Heavenly Sword Sect anymore, right?" After sitting down, Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"No, it's not."
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng stifled his head and answered.
<br><br>Because he was here, not only was it the core of the entire formation, it was also the end of the entire formation, and its location was indeed outside of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>It seemed that this one in front of him had long since gained insight into all of this.
<br><br>Just what exactly does he want ah, simply does not give him half a bit of information.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng is getting more and more panic.
<br><br>But he did not dare to say, nor did he dare to ask, only able to force himself to calm down and wait and see what happens.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Receiving confirmation, Yi Feng nodded, and his gaze subconsciously glanced at the chessboard on the stone table next to him.
<br><br>"Oh, old man you still know how to play chess?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Slightly, slightly."
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng responded nervously, remembering something, and added, "But right now, it's a dead game."
<br><br>After saying that, he looked stiffly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>His words were, in fact, full of temptation.
<br><br>Because the appearance of this person in front of him could very well be the crisis of the Heavenly Sword Sect predicted by the old ancestor of the Heavenly Sword Sect before he sat down.
<br><br>Equivalent to say.
<br><br>The young man in front of you, also and the game in front of you, have a thousand links.
<br><br>Therefore, Ye Tiansheng wanted to test the test, what exactly would Yi Feng's move be.
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, and with a sweep of his palm, he swept off the pieces placed on the chess board and put them back into the chess urn.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Tian Sheng's eyes were about to fall out.
<br><br>The chess game that had been placed here for ten thousand years was actually destroyed by this person in front of him?
<br><br>Wouldn't that mean that his Heavenly Sword Sect would no longer have a day to solve the game?
<br><br>"What do you mean by that?"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng got up with a red face and asked, trembling his body, already on the verge of a rampage.
