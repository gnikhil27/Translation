On the ground.
<br><br>There was a shocking corpse lying on the ground.
<br><br>Surrounded by scurrying flies, the corpse was also crawling with small insects, and it could be seen that he had been dead for many days.
<br><br>And this corpse, it is the bull devil she has been looking for a long time!
<br><br>This made Yun Yaoyao unable to calm down for a long time.
<br><br>It made her incredulous.
<br><br>The strength of a sixth grade Demon Emperor actually said he was dead?
<br><br>This is not a wild boar or a other demonic beast ah, this is a demon emperor, in this kind of mountain is an invincible existence ah!
<br><br>Hold back the shock in your heart, a jade hand to cover the nose at the same time, sharp gaze poking around the corpse of the bull demon.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>She wants to understand, a six life demon emperor, in the end how to die here. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But don't look not know.
<br><br>A look directly shocked.
<br><br>In the bull devil's head, she saw a penetrating sword wound, which directly broke the bull devil's terrifying defense, and also split the demon dan in his head, directly into two halves.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Once again, she drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>From the scene, there was no trace of a fight at all, which meant that this person had killed the bull demon in one second with his sword.
<br><br>"How terrifying of a sword should it be to be able to do that!?"
<br><br>She marveled.
<br><br>Suddenly, the eyes moved.
<br><br>She was surprised again to find that a certain part of the bull demon's body was missing, having been sliced away by someone with a single sword.
<br><br>"This, what kind of person is it?"
<br><br>"To be so unforgiving!"
<br><br>"A sword killed the bull devil not to mention, even the corpse was not spared."
<br><br>With a complicated expression, she was frozen in place for a long time.
<br><br>Originally vowed to seek revenge on the Bull Demon, but did not expect that the latter had long since returned to the west.
<br><br>"Hmph, doing more evil, it's also your retribution!"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao said indifferently, and was ready to go back with her sword.
<br><br>But she just took a few steps, and then she was surprised to find something.
<br><br>She hurriedly walked over to take a look, and immediately found another demon beast's corpse lying on the ground.
<br><br>"It's actually another demon clan!"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's pretty brow frowned slightly.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that next she found the corpse of a second, third, and fourth beast ......
<br><br>This made her slow down for a long time.
<br><br>Because just now she counted, at least twenty to thirty demon beasts died nearby, and these demon beasts, if you add the bull devil, from demon master to demon emperor level.
<br><br>Of course, there are also many real beasts.
<br><br>But whether it was a beast or a demon beast, they were all without exception, all of them were killed by a sword cut.
<br><br>This kind of tactic made Yun Yaoyao's body couldn't help but feel cold.
<br><br>"This person, what kind of person is he?"
<br><br>She couldn't help but speculate about this person's identity again.
<br><br>This person's strength, just how strong should he be?
<br><br>Wild beasts to Demon Emperors actually made no difference in his eyes, they were all like ants, cut down with a single sword.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The most incredible thing for Yun Yaoyao is that from the time of death of these demon beasts, these demon beasts died when she was inside the cave not far away.
<br><br>And outside the cave appeared such a terrifying expert, she actually did not hear half of the movement.
<br><br>Thinking about this.
<br><br>She sensed a hint of something unusual.
<br><br>Why this mysterious expert, to kill so many demonic beasts in the vicinity of their cave, while remote from the cave, but no such situation?
<br><br>And at the same time ignore her and Yi Feng who were inside the cave?
<br><br>What is his purpose?
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao frowned and pondered.
<br><br>All kinds of speculation seems that this mysterious expert is more like protecting him and Yi Feng who are inside the cave.
<br><br>Yi Feng?
<br><br>A thunderbolt rang out in her head.
<br><br>This person.
<br><br>It can't be the Yi Feng that she has been living with for days, right?
<br><br>When she thought of this, she was filled with disbelief.
<br><br>But even if you can't believe it, through all the previous, it is very likely to be Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng body does not make sense, there are many things in itself.
<br><br>For example, a mortal, how can have such good luck, into the mountain range so deep without encountering a demon beast, and still live unharmed?
<br><br>And before she was inside the cave, clearly feel a few demon beasts and Yi Feng met, those few demon beasts but suddenly lost the breath not to say, Yi Feng also came back unharmed.
<br><br>So think about it.
<br><br>It seems like the possibility that Yi Feng is this mysterious expert is getting bigger and bigger.
<br><br>She couldn't help but sweep up into the air and turn back towards where Yi Feng was flying over, obviously at this moment she desperately wanted to verify this matter.
<br><br>Along the way.
<br><br>She did not stop in the slightest, turning into a stream of light in mid-air.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>She had returned to the mountain peak where Yi Feng was.
<br><br>But before she could fully approach, she suddenly heard a miserable voice coming from inside the mountain.
<br><br>"Shit, help!"
<br><br>"I'm so scared!"
<br><br>With the miserable scream, Yun Yaoyao saw Yi Feng jumping straight there, crazy like jumping away towards the distance.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Yun Yoyao asked as he hurriedly flew over.
<br><br>"Wow, big sister you finally came back."
<br><br>And seeing Yun Yaoyao rush back, Yi Feng was like seeing a big savior, rushing over, his mouth shouting in panic: "There, there's a big caterpillar ah!"
<br><br>"Caterpillar?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's eyebrows suddenly frowned.
<br><br>"Mmm ah, about to scare me to death."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a panicked face, while hiding behind Yun Yoyao.
<br><br>Yun Yoyo was speechless for a while, and with a wave of his palm, the whole small area was razed to the ground.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Awesome."
<br><br>"Finally, it's settled."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng just walked out from behind Yun Yoyo, wiped a handful of cold sweat, and said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>Looking at this appearance of Yi Feng, Yun Yao Yao's face could not say what kind of look.
<br><br>At the same time the heart laughs at itself.
<br><br>A caterpillar are frightened into such a guy, she would actually think that is a sword cut bull devil mysterious expert.
<br><br>It's really ridiculous!
