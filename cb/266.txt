"Bang!"
<br><br>However, Duan Qingfeng waved his palm, and a force fell onto Peng Ying with a bang, slamming her heavily on the ground.
<br><br>Afterwards, he clasped his fist and looked at Yang Tianyu and the others, and with red eyes, he said sadly, "Gentlemen, today is my Heavenly Sword Sect's fault, this Peng Xian'er is yours to take away and hand over to that gentleman for disposal, and I hope that those of you who have dealt with the gentleman can put in a good word for my Heavenly Sword Sect and let my Heavenly Sword Sect off the hook!"
<br><br>After saying that, he landed violently on the ground with both legs.
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>The ground cracked with a loud bang.
<br><br>Then he heavily knocked and said with red eyes, "Please, all of you."
<br><br>At this moment, the originally tigerish Lord of the Mountain Sect had aged several points in an instant.
<br><br>Obviously, Duan Qingfeng distinguished clearly, if this matter is not handled properly will cause what kind of consequences!
<br><br>This consequence, his Heavenly Sword Sect can not afford.
<br><br>Therefore, at this moment, he made a wise choice. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Sect master."
<br><br>"Sect master."
<br><br>Seeing this, the elders and many disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect had red eyes, in order to seek a way of life for them disciples, the titled Heavenly Sword Sect Sect Master knelt down in public!
<br><br>Looking at this scene, Yang Tianyu and others were not feeling the same in their hearts.
<br><br>Although these sects of theirs usually fought openly and secretly, but at this moment, Duan Qingfeng's action made them feel admired.
<br><br>"Old Duan, we have no right to speak in front of Sir, but I can show you a clear path." At this moment, Yang Tianyu said.
<br><br>"I also hope to be informed."
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng trembled and looked at Yang Tianyu.
<br><br>"Sir, your heart is bigger than the sky, if your disciple wasn't too unenlightened, he wouldn't have issued this anger at all." Yang Tianyu said, "Even so, sir only destroyed your mountain gate, but did not hurt the innocent, this is enough to show that sir intends to let you live."
<br><br>"So, leave Peng Xian'er behind and you guys leave quickly!" Yang Tianyu said.
<br><br>At these words, Duan Qingfeng's heart trembled.
<br><br>That's right.
<br><br>His mountain gate was destroyed, but most of the disciples in the gate were unharmed except for a few unlucky ones who were implicated.
<br><br>This is enough to show that the one who really showed mercy.
<br><br>Otherwise, with that one's tactics, if he really wanted to destroy his Heavenly Sword Sect, would he, Duan Qingfeng, still be able to stay here and talk?
<br><br>"Sir, be merciful, thank you for the grace of forgiveness!"
<br><br>He kowtowed heavily in the direction of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>Then he got up again and bowed towards Yang Tianyu and the others, "Many thanks, gentlemen."
<br><br>He got up.
<br><br>Leading hundreds of thousands of disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect to retreat.
<br><br>"Master, don't, don't, save me!" Seeing this, Peng Xian'er, who was lying on the ground like mud, emitted a pleading voice.
<br><br>But Duan Qingfeng and the others didn't give her another look.
<br><br>Fearfully, she turned her gaze back to Yang Tianyu and the others and knocked her head heavily on the ground as she hurriedly begged, "Please, please, please let me go."
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"We don't dare to let you go, your fate will be decided when the gentleman comes!"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu coldly snorted, showing no mercy to Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Peng Xian'er fell to the ground with her face ashen.
<br><br>The crowd did not pay any more attention to Peng Xian'er, but retreated the people they brought, while some of the people left behind also landed on the ground and looked their eyes into the distance.
<br><br>There, a young figure walked over in a leisurely manner.
<br><br>In his hand.
<br><br>And carrying a fish.
<br><br>This fish was caught by a small stream when Yi Feng went down the mountain just now.
<br><br>See this fish, the crowd could not help but feel, this gentleman really will live to the extreme ah!
<br><br>Running on the ground, flying in the sky, up to the demon emperor, down to the fish and shrimp, there is nothing he does not eat.
<br><br>The crowd hurriedly and nervously greeted him.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>The people have respectfully passed out their voices.
<br><br>"Oh, you are?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's gaze scanned the crowd and immediately found quite a few acquaintances, such as the Fifth Longkong, Yun Xianque, Shu Qinhua, and Xue Qinzhu who had come to his store, in addition to Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu whom he had encountered inside the mountain.
<br><br>"You guys, how come you guys are here?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was surprised, he didn't expect at all that he would run into this group of people here and stay together at the same time.
<br><br>"Sir, we are naturally here waiting for you." The crowd responded.
<br><br>"Waiting for me?" Yi Feng's head was full of question marks, "How did you guys know I was here?"
<br><br>The crowd was stunned and couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.
<br><br>However, Yun Xian Que had a quick brain and immediately opened his mouth.
<br><br>"It's like this, we all like sir's calligraphy and painting very much, and we inadvertently learned about your whereabouts, so we wanted to come and meet you in excitement."
<br><br>They knew that with Yi Feng's means, he must have known that they were here long ago.
<br><br>And when Yi Feng asked this question, it was obvious that he was treating himself as a mortal again.
<br><br>So they naturally did not dare to break through that layer of window paper, and also to cater to this one as a mortal.
<br><br>Like painting and calligraphy?
<br><br>Yi Feng thought of this group of people have pulled their own things to see, suddenly realized, so they are engaged in art ah.
<br><br>In that case, this group of people are their own fans?
<br><br>"So all are my fans?" Yi Feng smiled lightly, with a pleasant expression.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng's expression, the crowd knew that the words were right, so they hurriedly responded heartily, "Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng revealed that he was really like that.
<br><br>I didn't expect that there were such avid fans in the other world, actually coming from thousands of miles to find him.
<br><br>It seems that he has become famous in this area for playing the piano and painting, and his fans have grown to Nansha by themselves.
<br><br>In a flash, Yi Feng had the illusion that he had become a sought-after star. In his previous life, I'm afraid that only Li Bai, a great man, would have been treated like this!
<br><br>And aside, lying on the ground, Peng Xian'er looked at this scene, her face was a deadly gray.
<br><br>Although she had been unwilling to admit in her heart that this childhood friend whom she had dumped was a supreme master, but when she really saw this group of top experts from Nansha respectfully in front of Yi Feng, she had to accept this fact.
<br><br>This made her hard to the extreme.
<br><br>That is to say, the powerful she pursued, the greatest opportunity she pursued, was actually on her side?
<br><br>Especially thinking about the time when she dumped Yi Feng in order to enter the Castle Peak Sect and be with Yu Wujie, wouldn't that mean that she had thrown away an immortal pill but picked up a weed?
<br><br>Once she thought of this, she crawled towards Yi Feng and begged, "Yi Feng Yi Feng, I was wrong, please, I was wrong."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was chatting with the crowd, was stunned to see this miserable appearance of Peng Ying crawling in.
