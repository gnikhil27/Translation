A few days later.
<br><br>Yi Feng set off with eleven hundred people, in great numbers.
<br><br>Directly teleported to the Immortal World's Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>After all, there is no way ah.
<br><br>The immortal world's qi point is much longer, otherwise he would have stayed in the immortal river continent to muddle through.
<br><br>And he also thought, if he completed this oasis plan, is also considered a feat.
<br><br>A great achievement.
<br><br>Maybe the system will reward him with a few hundred thousand points of luck.
<br><br>Open up the wilderness well.
<br><br>Must have tools.
<br><br>This is not, before going to the world, Yi Feng will be the backyard of the martial arts school within the stock of those agricultural tools, also all took out, together with all brought to the immortal world. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The deacon's people are still the same old few.
<br><br>Ye Bei ah, shake the sky Que ah, Qing Huan phase ah and so on.
<br><br>As for the dung picker needless to say, Lu Dasheng this guy has the posture of a big dung.
<br><br>There are arrangements for this group of people, Yi Feng just drop the plan, you can be a handful.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Under the strict arrangement, the personnel were distributed in an orderly manner.
<br><br>Ye Bei with his bricklayer and mason team, began to burn the kiln to build bricks to build houses; Lu Dasheng with the manure team, also began to measure and manure pit site selection; Wu Yonghong led the farming team, open up farmland also on the trip; Qing Huan Xiang led the water team, also ready to go to sea to start fishing operations.
<br><br>The original Shadow Island Gong Chen and other people, for this suddenly came to the 1,100 people, quite some discomfort.
<br><br>Sir.
<br><br>This bring a thousand human immortals, a thousand earth immortals, what is the use?
<br><br>Also quite a bit unhappy.
<br><br>Why should they, these Reincarnation Immortal Realm, True Element Immortal Realm, have to listen to these people of theirs?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When they saw a group of people from Qing Huan Xiang preparing to go out to sea to catch fish, they still couldn't help but remind.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Not fast is not fast, we are all Mr. people.
<br><br>"This sea, you may not go down."
<br><br>Gong Chen said solemnly, "This sea is not ordinary waters, in the ancient immortal world, is a curse forbidden land, not only the creatures on the island is affected, this black sea is also the same."
<br><br>"Just take the most common shadow devouring fish, it is very scary, this fish although there is little cultivation, but even if our True Element Immortal realm strength is bitten on a bite, it will end up in the dust."
<br><br>"What's more, in addition to the Shadow Devouring Fish, there are countless other mutated demons in this Black Sea."
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>On the side, Jiang to remember the once tragic death of that subordinate, also softly reminded: "You better not go down to the sea, it is best to receive are not close, but do not lose your lives because of this."
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Qing Huan accordingly, expressionlessly walked up to the wooden boat.
<br><br>"???"
<br><br>Look at Qing Huan phase this gaze, Gong Chen and others a question mark.
<br><br>This human immortal.
<br><br>Is not understand their words?
<br><br>They were just about to continue talking, when they saw Qing Huan Xiang with two people scattered a net, and then dragged up a basket of fish.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>All of them were Shadow Devouring Fish.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi and the others stared wide eyed and shouted, "Go, get away from those fish, it's dangerous!"
<br><br>But just as the words were finished, it was too late.
<br><br>That fished up the shadow devouring fish jumped everywhere, some directly bit the heel of Qing Huan phase.
<br><br>"It's over."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi and the others' faces turned pale.
<br><br>Her subordinate's tragic appearance before he died emerged from her mind.
<br><br>That bloody and horrible scene was about to be staged again.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Half a ring passed, that bloody and horrible scene did not happen, instead, Qing Huan phase shook his thighs, shook the shadow devouring fish off on the plywood, and lightly said, "This fish is quite fierce."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Several people took the wooden boat and set off towards the further sea.
<br><br>A net went down.
<br><br>Another group of shadow-devouring fish.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>A black sea more fearful saber tooth shark, suddenly broke the surface of the water, towards the boat.
<br><br>The sky-rushing demonic energy and the blackened fangs, looking at Gong Chen and other people's scalp numb.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the face of this situation, the plywood Qing Huan phase still expressionless, only towards the next hand to make a wink.
<br><br>The young man who played the hand picked up the paddle on the plywood, a stick swung over.
<br><br>The vicious saber-tooth shark directly fainted and landed on the plywood.
<br><br>The other two hands to see the situation quickly followed, the knife fell, open intestines and belly.
<br><br>In a short time.
<br><br>It was divided into a neat piece of fish meat.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Gong Chen and others looked at each other.
<br><br>Watching the eyes stare straight, the mouth of the cold air straight pumping.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"They?"
<br><br>"Really, it's a human immortal?"
<br><br>Gong Chen stammered and asked.
<br><br>But his question, no one could answer him ......
