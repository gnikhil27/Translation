A time.
<br><br>All the experts present all focused their eyes on the door of the stone hall.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Despite the fervor in the eyes of the crowd, the crowd did not make a move right off the bat.
<br><br>"When are we going to make our move?" Yun Xian Que asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"There's no rush, there will always be people who can't resist moving first, it's better to let them explore the path first." Lin Bo said softly.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>An old school expert such as Lin Bo was relatively experienced in such matters.
<br><br>Just when the experts of several major sects were tacitly not moving, there were indeed other experts who could not resist.
<br><br>Although they knew that the first to rush up was also the most dangerous, but danger and opportunity often coexist.
<br><br>"Flipping Cloud Hand!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Then they saw that a Martial Emperor expert swept out of the air, then rolled his palm in mid-air, turning into a huge palm print, and slapped his palm on top of the stone door.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A huge sonic boom sounded, but the door did not move at all.
<br><br>This scene surprised everyone present.
<br><br>This was, after all, the full force of a Martial Emperor expert's strike, but it couldn't even open a door, the tomb of a Martial Saint expert, it really lived up to its name.
<br><br>However, although the door exceeded the expectations of the crowd, but there is no danger is a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Seeing this, the fifth long air does not show traces of the old man next to a look.
<br><br>The old man nodded, slowly out of the intermingled Yuan Qi voice came out, "Gentlemen, you should also see, want to break open this door to enter, we are afraid that we need to temporarily join forces, as for the respective opportunities after entering, and then to each according to the means."
<br><br>At these words, all the people present nodded their heads and had no opinion.
<br><br>Subsequently, under the joint hundreds of experts, a strong attack fell on the stone door.
<br><br>But what the crowd did not expect was that the stone door only trembled and still did not show any signs of opening.
<br><br>This instantly made the crowd present frown.
<br><br>It was so hard to come here, could the door not even enter?
<br><br>"This door is so hard think there must be formations exist. I heard that the Blowing Snow Villa is good at the forbidden art of formations, especially the fifth formation elder, so can you help everyone think of a way?" At this time, Peng Xian'er emitted a leisurely lilting voice and turned her gaze to the old man next to the fifth long sky.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"I think this gate, only the fifth formation elder has a solution."
<br><br>At one time, other people also came with their voices.
<br><br>The fifth formation nodded and nodded his head, his hand seals moved, a slight wave flooded in front of his body and gently touched the stone door, at the same time, a pair of sharp eyes surveyed the surroundings of the stone door.
<br><br>After a long time, he frowned intensely.
<br><br>"Fifth formation elder, how is it?"
<br><br>The people asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"To enter this door is as difficult as ascending to heaven." The fifth formation said in a deep voice.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd's faces changed.
<br><br>"May I ask Elder, what is going on?" Someone asked.
<br><br>"As I predicted, this is the Yin and Yang Formation, in addition to this heavenly gate on the ground, there should be another earthly gate under the ground." Fifth Longkong explained, "To open the heavenly gate, there are only two ways."
<br><br>"The first way is to break it with force, but it requires the spell caster to attack beyond the one who set up the formation."
<br><br>At these words, the crowd shook their heads.
<br><br>Since it was the tomb of a Martial Saint, the formation must have been set up by a Martial Saint, so who was present who had the ability to break it with force?
<br><br>This is simply impossible!
<br><br>"What about the other way?" The crowd hurriedly asked again.
<br><br>"The other way is to send someone to sneak into the ground door, just open the mechanism inside the ground door, and this stone door will naturally open."
<br><br>The fifth formation explained, "However, the ground door also has taboos, and only one person can enter at a time, and there are many formation organs, trying to find the stone door to open the organs, it is simply as difficult as the sky."
<br><br>"And more crucially, in order to enter the door, you must have the secret art of evasive earth technique, otherwise, it is impossible to find the door."
<br><br>At these words, the crowd all nodded their heads in a grave manner.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Everyone had already reacted to the fact that in order to get in, it was crucial to find someone who knew the earth reclamation technique to go in and open the mechanism.
<br><br>"So, sign up yourself if you know the earth transport technique!"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong's voice came out directly.
<br><br>However, there was a silence from the crowd.
<br><br>Not to mention whether anyone was willing to go down, just the secret art of earth transport, there were very few people practicing it.
<br><br>Although this secret art has quite a few functions, but it is not easy to practice it well at all, most people spend their minds on cultivation, who would practice an earth transport art that does not increase too much for combat?
<br><br>Just when the stalemate was over, under the veil, Peng Xian'er raised the corner of her mouth, looked at Yu Wujie, and said quietly, "I remember you, you seem to know the earth transport art?"
<br><br>Once Peng Xian'er's words fell, everyone present looked at Yu Wujie.
<br><br>Yu Wujie fiercely panicked, with a miserable white face.
<br><br>His kind of strength, is to come to see a lively, pull a random person can shoot him, never thought that this matter will be rolled into his body.
<br><br>"I I I I ......"
<br><br>He shivered and looked at Peng Xian'er and asked blankly, "You, how did you know that I can earth transport technique?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er didn't say anything, just looked at him meaningfully.
<br><br>"Okay, no more nonsense, just this kid go down!"
<br><br>"Yes, you just go down to the earth door!"
<br><br>Seeing that it was hard to find a cultivator of the earth transport technique, the crowd passed out their voices.
<br><br>Yu Wujie suddenly went soft on the ground.
<br><br>Cold sweat ran down his forehead.
<br><br>"I I I, I can't, I really can't." He cried and said.
<br><br>"A man can't say he can't, I originally liked you a lot, and even went out of my way to investigate you, otherwise how would I know that you know the earth transport technique?"
<br><br>At this time, Peng Xian'er suddenly approached Yu Wujie and said lightly, "So you can't let me down, after all, to be my Peng Xian'er's man, you always have to show some skills, don't you?"
<br><br>"Your man?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie's eyes snapped open and said in shock, "You mean I can be your ...... man?"
<br><br>"Shhh!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er blew a light breath and said leisurely, "Don't ask, it means what you understand."
<br><br>This breath, let Yu Wujie hit a shiver, especially the kind of light fragrance wafting out of Peng Xian'er, immediately let him feel like hitting the chicken blood seems to be.
<br><br>"Okay, I'll go!"
<br><br>He climbed up, then came out a solemn voice.
<br><br>"This way, only then is a man!" Peng Xian'er jade hand gently crossed Yu Wujie's chest, full of appreciation.
<br><br>"I will not let you down."
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie clenched his teeth, without saying a word hand seals out, and then towards the ground vanish down.
<br><br>"Fifth formation elder, what do you think of the odds?" After Yu Wujie went down, Peng Xian'er looked at the fifth formation and asked.
<br><br>The fifth formation did not speak, just shook his head.
<br><br>When the others saw this, their expressions also instantly became depressed.
<br><br>After all, they also understand that this what Yu Wujie, strength is really too poor some, that ground door organs, I'm afraid just enter the door to cool.
<br><br>But at least there is a person to try his luck.
<br><br>While disappearing towards the ground, Yu Wujie full of enthusiasm also abated and went, only to understand that this kind of door which is his kind of rookie can enter.
<br><br>At once, Yu Wujie did not dare to advance, hiding in the earth trembling.
<br><br>"Phew, finally I've made up my one billion substitution techniques."
<br><br>In the underground hall, Wu Chang'an took a long breath as he put away the body doubles he had just made.
<br><br>"This still won't work, we have to find a way out!"
<br><br>He walked vigilantly through the hall, and suddenly noticed that on the wall at one side, there were many buttons for organs.
<br><br>"Could this be?"
<br><br>"A way to close the mechanism?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an's eyes lit up and with a scattering of hands, he laid out the 100,000 substitutes and then carefully pressed one of the buttons.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>Also at the same time, a booming sound came from the ground.
<br><br>Then under the unbelievable gaze of the crowd, the stone door opened with a bang.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"He succeeded?"
<br><br>Incredible voices came from the crowd.
<br><br>"This is too, too fast, right?"
<br><br>Of course, the most incredible among them was Peng Xian'er, the face under that veil, flowing with a strong shock.
<br><br>Yu Wujie actually.
<br><br>Really entered the earth door and opened the stone door?
