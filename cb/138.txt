Finally, a shadow appeared in the sight of the crowd.
<br><br>Then, it became clearer and clearer.
<br><br>White flowers.
<br><br>And as he approached, Zhu Yun and the others' nerves tensed up, rushing towards the Castle Peak Gate with such might was not an enemy attack, so their attacks were already mobilized.
<br><br>However, just as they were about to launch their attack, they finally got a good look at the appearance of the person coming.
<br><br>"Master Lu?"
<br><br>The eyes of the crowd fell to the ground at once.
<br><br>What made them even more unbelievable was that this titled number one pill refiner in Nansha actually did not have a trace of G.
<br><br>Inevitably, Old Ancestor Qingshan hurriedly greeted him and asked with a complicated face, "Master Lu, what kind of sin have you made, why are you running around naked?"
<br><br>At these words, Lu Dasheng's chest was stuffy with anger, and a mouthful of sweetness rushed to his mouth, but he swallowed it down hard.
<br><br>But he just swallowed, the straightforward and fast-talking Zhu Yun on the side, coldly made up a knife. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Master Lu, although you have this hobby I can understand, but my Castle Peak Sect after all, there are so many disciples, especially the female disciples account for a large part of the disciples, you are really bad influence ah, and also degrades your reputation as the first pill refiner in Nansha!"
<br><br>The words fell into Lu Dasheng's ears, finally he could not hold back, just swallowed the mouthful of blood directly spurted out, full of murderous intent glared at Zhu Yun, turned into a stream of light zipped into his residence.
<br><br>"This, did I say something wrong?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun said with a face full of confusion.
<br><br>"Master Lu has usually been arrogant, so I think it's true that I said something heavy." Lu Qingshan frowned and said, "You guys go and work on other things first, I'll go and see him."
<br><br>Saying that, Lu Qingshan flew towards Lu Dasheng's residence.
<br><br>Although his horizons had expanded a lot since he met Mr. Lu, after all, Lu Dasheng was the number one pill refiner in Nansha, so it was better not to offend him if he could.
<br><br>When Lu Qingshan came to Lu Dasheng's place, Lu Dasheng had finally re-dressed.
<br><br>Both hands were also considered completely liberated.
<br><br>"Lu Qingshan, what exactly do you mean?" Lu Dasheng stared deadly at the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak and shouted in a deep voice: "You said before that you would take me to get the Flame Pearl, yet you left me hanging in your Castle Peak Sect, am I, Lu Dasheng, not so much in your eyes?"
<br><br>"Master Lu, please forgive me."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan hurriedly explained, "It's really because I encountered some unavoidable matters that needed to be dealt with some time ago, so I had no choice but to leave you here, please don't take it to heart, Master Lu!"
<br><br>"Humph, don't pull these excuses with me, I'm too lazy to pull them with you." Lu Dasheng's face was covered with frost and said, "Tomorrow, at the latest tomorrow, take me to find that senior you said, get the flame beads, and I will leave immediately."
<br><br>At these words, Lu Qingshan's face was covered with ugliness.
<br><br>Now that Mr.'s disciple was still injured, it was not a wise move to bring someone to disturb the senior at this time.
<br><br>So he hurriedly said, "Master Lu, is there really nothing that can replace this flame bead?"
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng slammed the table and looked at Old Master Qingshan with a gloomy face and drank: "Lu Qingshan, are you planning to trick me?"
<br><br>"No, no, I don't dare." Lu Qingshan explained, "It's just that this senior is incredibly strong, he has a lot of things he is busy with recently, if we disturb him, neither for you nor me, it's not a good thing!"
<br><br>"Seniors seniors, a mouthful of seniors, Lu Qingshan I think you simply do not want to hand over the flame beads, and deliberately made up, right?" Lu Dasheng stood up, his body's thick aura forced Lu Qingshan directly.
<br><br>"Master Lu, I, Lu Qingshan, am not so much as that." When his advice was not heeded, a sulk appeared on Lu Qingshan's face, and he said in a slightly heavy tone, "There is no half-hearted lie in what I said, and I am doing it for your own good."
<br><br>"To put it bluntly, if you really offend that senior, not to mention you a small South Sand No. 1 pill refiner, even if the entire East Sheng Continent No. 1 pill refiner, may not be able to resist this anger!"
<br><br>"Alarming words."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng laughed coldly and said disdainfully, "Since you must make this person sound so formidable, then I, Lu Dasheng, will have to touch this person's bad luck, to see whether he will meekly hand over the Flame Pearl or I will meekly kneel down and beg for mercy."
<br><br>"You, you really do not listen to advice!" Lu Qingshan grunted angrily.
<br><br>"Hmph, Lu Qingshan, you don't have to continue to be alarmist here, I don't eat your set, I said, tomorrow you must take me to get the Flame Pearl, or else ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Lu Dasheng's face was cold.
<br><br>"What do you want?" Lu Qingshan's face changed.
<br><br>"I'll go on a killing spree in your Qingshan Gate, I'll see if you can stop me!" Lu Dasheng said with a face full of viciousness, bluntly threatening Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan clenched his teeth, his face was extremely blue with anger, looking at Lu Dasheng's lofty appearance, he could not wait to kill him.
<br><br>But for the sake of the lives of the disciples of the Castle Peak Sect, he had to reluctantly lower his head.
<br><br>"Okay, I'll take you there tomorrow."
<br><br>"Just, I hope you won't regret it then."
<br><br>After saying that, Lu Qingshan angrily flung his robe sleeve and left.
<br><br>"Regret?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng laughed coldly and raised the corners of his mouth disdainfully.
