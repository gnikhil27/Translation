The rhinoceros forest and other demons are secretly making up their minds.
<br><br>On the surface honestly, the heart is calculating, as soon as we leave this island, we will start to make trouble.
<br><br>Not long after, the raft disembarked.
<br><br>Old Zhou, who was supporting the boat, nodded respectfully to Bonehead and the others and continued to support the raft to transport supplies.
<br><br>The trembling black bear glanced at the sky and found that it was all right, so he let out a naive laugh: "Hahahaha, it's okay, I'm really okay, it must be that seal that has passed too long and failed."
<br><br>"Don't be silly, even if the seal is still there, with big brother here, can it still hurt you?" The centipede couldn't help but lecture.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Black Bear nodded his head in a hurry.
<br><br>"Brother, how do we get there, by flying?" Dog couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"With these four big idiots, is it necessary to fly over by ourselves?" Bone Ben Wei couldn't help but say.
<br><br>This voice fell in the ears of rhinoceros Lin and other people, immediately made them angry, gnashing their teeth look, can't wait to immediately go up to the thousand will Bone Ben Wei to slap. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"What's the hurry?"
<br><br>On the contrary, the black feather is calm, leisurely said: "Let him first jump for a while, now he jumped more happy, later we will torture him more miserable."
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Black Feather."
<br><br>Only then did the three demons of Rhinoceros Forest hold back the anger in their hearts.
<br><br>"But brother, these four guys' strength is sealed by the master, how can they be mounts?" At this time, the Night Wind Centipede couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"That's not much of a problem, just unlock it."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei waved his hand and said lightly.
<br><br>At the sound of his voice.
<br><br>The four black feather demons snapped their heads up.
<br><br>This skeleton was not only fleshless, but also brainless?
<br><br>How dare they unseal them, are they not afraid of their revenge?
<br><br>They thought that Skeleton Ben Wei was just saying it to listen, but what they didn't expect was that Skeleton Ben Wei actually ran over and removed the chains from their bodies.
<br><br>Whoosh!
<br><br>The moment the chains were removed, the cultivation of the four demons returned collectively.
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>At the same time, the four demons couldn't help but laugh wildly inside.
<br><br>I thought I would have to burn my cultivation or life force to break the chains, but I never thought that this skeleton in front of me, actually really so brainless, really remove the chains from their bodies.
<br><br>It's like stepping through iron shoes and finding no place to go.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, Lord Blackfeather, you watch, the three of us will immediately dismantle this skeleton in front of you." The three demons of the rhinoceros forest said excitedly, and immediately wanted to make a move towards the skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Good at the last moment, black feather timely stopped them.
<br><br>"My lord what are you waiting for, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!" Rhinoceros Lin said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Still have to wait, although now our cultivation is restored, but is still too close to this island, with that human means, a little notice may once again catch us, so wait until far away from the island before making a move is not too late." Black feather towards the three demons voice transmission said.
<br><br>Three demons thought about it, and indeed so.
<br><br>That human's tactics surpassed their understanding, and if they do it now, it is likely that they will be caught again.
<br><br>Unable to help, the three looked at Black Feather with reverence again.
<br><br>The immortal world big brother is worthy of the immortal world big brother.
<br><br>Stable enough!
<br><br>Whether it was their mindset, cultivation, or city spirit, they were all incomparable.
<br><br>"Learn well, if you don't have something, you won't be able to survive in a world of deceit like the Immortal World." Black Feather couldn't help but lecture.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest nodded respectfully in a hurry.
<br><br>"You, get down for me."
<br><br>The dog walked over and scolded at Rhinoceros Lin.
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin's face was full of anger, this dog actually really wanted to use him as a mount, he really couldn't hold back a bit.
<br><br>So he once again turned his gaze to Black Feather, asking for Black Feather's opinion.
<br><br>But found that the skeleton Ben Wei already sat on the head of the black feather, and then swept the air to fly out.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get down.
<br><br>Seeing this, Rhinoceros Lin gritted his teeth and got down.
<br><br>After all, even the immortal world of black feather big brother are stoic endure down, he rhinoceros Lin also nothing can not endure, anyway, later can be revenge.
<br><br>The dog sat smoothly on the shoulder of the rhinoceros Lin.
<br><br>On one side, the centipede also climbed on the head of the oldest of the western demon forest, rhinoceros Miao.
<br><br>"This, I'm not too good, right?"
<br><br>Black Bear looked at the last demon in front of him, which was half a point smaller than his size, and he coyly scratched his head.
<br><br>"What's not good, you need to know, why the master gave us these demons, but is not to let us as a mount to pick up Xiao Xiaoqing it, rest assured to sit is." Night Wind Centipede shouted.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>The black bear smiled nervously and jumped up to sit on his butt on the top of the last demon's head.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>This last demon beast named rhinoceros earth, legs shivered violently, this butt almost pressed his shit out, full of red face, the ground beneath his feet cracked and opened, gritted his teeth before he could barely stand still.
<br><br>"Lao San, hold on."
<br><br>"For the sake of our great plan to get out of danger and revenge, bear with it." Seeing this, rhinoceros Lin hurriedly sent a voice towards rhinoceros earth, cheering.
<br><br>"But the weight of this bear defies common sense, it's really heavy!"
<br><br>Hornet earth face difficult, he never thought that this bear is so heavy, he tang demon immortal strength is difficult to bear.
<br><br>"Lao San, for our grand plan, who is not bearing a thousand pounds of weight for me and my big brother?"
<br><br>"Remember, you can, really can't hold up the heart silently recite the words of Lord Black Feather."
<br><br>"Pattern, and city!"
<br><br>At this time, rhinoceros Miao also threw a firm look towards rhinoceros earth, transmitting the voice out.
<br><br>"Second brother you ......"
<br><br>Looking at the centipede on top of rhinoceros Miao's head, rhinoceros earth could not help but transmit voice: "How about we switch?"
<br><br>"Ahem, I seem to have heard Lord Blackfeather ahead calling, I'll go ahead." Rhinoceros Miao coughed awkwardly, then swept the air and went after Black Feather.
<br><br>Rhinoceros Earth was again busy to look for help, towards Rhinoceros Lin.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Lao-san ah, your second brother has some words, there is also a point, by the way, Lord Black Feather is indeed calling, I also have to follow." Rhinoceros Lin carrying the dog likewise swept into the air and chased up towards the black feather ahead.
<br><br>Time passed slowly.
<br><br>In a short while, the group had arrived in the middle of the plains of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Tribe.
<br><br>"Here we are."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said.
<br><br>"Yes! It's been a long time since I've been back."
<br><br>The dog's gaze looked at the familiarity of everything, and his mood was a bit complicated.
<br><br>At that time when he ran away, he was just the unloved third prince, the fop in the tribe's mouth.
<br><br>But nowadays, he, the small Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe is no longer in his eyes.
<br><br>Even the Ao Qingcheng, who was once so high and mighty that she didn't have to look at him, has actually given birth to a litter of children for him.
<br><br>Everything, everything was different.
<br><br>"Brother."
<br><br>Dog Zi shouted.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at him.
<br><br>"It's good to follow the master to follow you." The dog's eyes twinkled with gratitude.
<br><br>"Disgusting."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was stunned, then skimmed his head, disdainful.
<br><br>"How come two more haven't arrived yet?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede asked.
<br><br>"Just wait."
<br><br>The dog glanced at the distance and said.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>But this wait, is most of the hour.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was already impatient with a black face.
<br><br>And Black Feather and the others did the same, because this place was about the same distance away, just waiting for the last rhinoceros earth to arrive, they could collectively attack and kill this group of damned mole crickets, Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Finally, after waiting for another half an hour, the rhinoceros earth on the back of the black bear, flying in the sky shakily ......
