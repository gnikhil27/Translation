The zither scores sent by the Heavenly Sword Sect and the Snow Blowing Villa finally reached Peng Xian'er and Fifth Changkong.
<br><br>After that, they picked out the best few zither scores among them, and then several people took turns to try them out.
<br><br>However, the effect was still unsatisfactory.
<br><br>Not only did the Fifth Formation and Long Jiankong have no more chances, but the Fifth Longkong and Peng Xian'er also only had one chance each.
<br><br>The two had ugly faces.
<br><br>Without sufficient confidence, already is afraid to try.
<br><br>And things, is already gradually fall into a deadlock.
<br><br>Because for so many days, all the cultivators present had basically tried, but since the beginning, no one had been able to make Jiang Yu open his eyes, let alone satisfy him.
<br><br>"Meet senior Jiang Yu, let me try!"
<br><br>At this time, a beautiful voice came, and then the crowd was to see, a white clothed silhouette came holding the zither, towards Jiang Yu after a gentle bow, slowly landed on the ground.
<br><br>"Hoo!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Book qin painting, it's actually book qin painting!"
<br><br>"Oh my, how come she's here too!"
<br><br>When the crowd saw this, there were voices of astonishment, and there were even many cultivators who revealed a piggyback gaze.
<br><br>"This woman actually came, damn it!"
<br><br>And Peng Xian'er and the Fifth Longkong, similarly revealed a gloomy gaze.
<br><br>Shuqin Painting Shuqin Painting, as her name suggested, she had great achievements in the three attainments of calligraphy, zither technique, and painting technique.
<br><br>Not only that, she was also the first recognized person in the entire Nansha young generation, the first expert to break through the Martial Exaltation at a young age.
<br><br>In addition, she is also the saint daughter of the first sect in the South Sand, the Devil's Voice Sect.
<br><br>It could be said that she was a woman with countless haloes in one.
<br><br>Obviously, her appearance made the scene different.
<br><br>Because the crowd could see that this woman, most likely, had captured Jiang Yu's inheritance.
<br><br>"DONG!"
<br><br>The ancient zither's strings fluctuated, and the gentle sound of the zither came out.
<br><br>With the sound of her zither, many people could not help but keep quiet, and many more showed a shame.
<br><br>What they played, whether it was the tune or the zither skill, was not the same level compared to the book and zither painting.
<br><br>It has to be said.
<br><br>This person, Book Qin Painting, is true to her name.
<br><br>Finally, her song slowly came to an end, and her elf-like face slowly lifted up and turned her gaze towards Jiang Yu.
<br><br>And others, too, have also looked at Jiang Yu.
<br><br>Then, under the astonished gaze of the crowd, Jiang Yu on the zither platform slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>"But, it's not enough!"
<br><br>With two short sentences, Jiang Yu closed his eyes again.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"It's actually not enough!"
<br><br>"Oh my god, how in the world can this be obtained inheritance!"
<br><br>Seeing Jiang Yu say that the song that Book Qin Painting had just played wasn't enough, the crowd immediately exclaimed, but the good thing was that for so many days, Book Qin Painting had at least let Jiang Yu open his eyes.
<br><br>Book Qinhua's pretty eyebrows moved slightly, her pretty face didn't fluctuate, she got up and bowed towards Jiang Yu and retreated to the side.
<br><br>"Holy Maiden, this is not the way to go on!" Long Jiankong said in a deep voice: "Although Shu Qinhua has not won the inheritance, it seems that she still has the best chance now, we have to think of a solution quickly!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er frowned tightly and suddenly noticed that Yu Wujie had disappeared.
<br><br>"Where is he?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er asked.
<br><br>"This, just now he was there." Long Jiankong also frowned, apparently just now the mind was on the book qin painting, also completely did not notice when Yu Wujie disappeared.
<br><br>And at this moment Yu Wujie, is already in the Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"qin spectrum qin spectrum ......"
<br><br>While chanting in his mouth, he arrived at the entrance of the small martial arts school again.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The small martial arts school had gathered many people again and were meditating and gazing at Yi Feng who was sitting on the steps playing the guitar.
<br><br>"Let's have a song, the ordinary road."
<br><br>A song ended, and Yi Feng smiled at the crowd.
<br><br>Perhaps because of the audience, sitting here every day to play guitar seems to have become his habit, and the daily "ordinary road" he will never miss.
<br><br>"Dong Dong Dong ......"
<br><br>The guitar sounded and the crowd closed their eyes.
<br><br>The first time I heard the song, I was able to listen to it, and I couldn't help but admire it: "This song is really good, in my opinion, it's even better than that book and qin painting, so I'll copy it, maybe I can make a turnaround and get a martial arts saint's heritage.
<br><br>That's right.
<br><br>Yu Wujie rushed to this place, is remembered the last time I passed by to hear Yi Feng play the song, so want to copy this song, to Jiang Yu's tomb to try their luck.
<br><br>Finally, when Yi Feng's piano strings returned to calm, Yu Wujie also transcribed the entire song.
<br><br>"Well, although I don't know what kind of zither that guy is playing in his hand, but the effect should be similar to the zither played over here."
<br><br>Yu Wujie put away the score with a happy heart and swaggered towards the outside of the city.
<br><br>Across the street.
<br><br>It so happened that a dung-bearer came along.
<br><br>Yu Wujie frowned and shouted at the dung-bearer: "Hey, lowly mortal, can't you see that I am passing by here?
<br><br>However, what he didn't expect was that the dung-bearer suddenly had a golden light in his eyes and grabbed him by the neck, sticking his head into the dung bucket.
<br><br>After another violent beating, this is Yu Wujie thrown in the gutter, quietly left.
<br><br>"Damn, damn, what kind of man is this manure carrier, actually so powerful!"
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie swollen head and swollen face climbed up from the gutter, looking at the score in his arms, he let out a big sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Phew, fortunately, the score is fine."
<br><br>"Humph, no matter what you are, the future little master will want your life."
<br><br>Yu Wujie hurriedly changed his clothes and rushed towards the outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"What have you been doing?"
<br><br>Seeing Yu Wujie return, still with a faint stench, Peng Xian'er frowned and asked.
<br><br>"I just went back to pick up a song I used to compose, and there was a little accident on the way." Yu Wujie said evasively.
<br><br>"You composed the song?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er frowned slightly, although she knew Yu Wujie could play a little zither, but never knew that Yu Wujie could also compose a tune.
<br><br>"Oh, this is located in the brother is going to try?"
<br><br>"Maybe there's really a chance, after all, the last time the Heavenly Gate was opened by Brother Yu."
<br><br>"Brother Yu, hurry up and give it a try!"
<br><br>The crowd saw the situation and passed out voices.
<br><br>"Haha, you're welcome, then I'll go and try." Yu Wujie clasped his fist and responded with a smile.
<br><br>"Are you sure you can do it?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was full of distrust.
<br><br>"Holy Maiden, what's the harm in letting him try!" Long Jiankong said from the side.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er pondered slightly and said towards Yu Wujie, "Then you go ahead."
<br><br>"Okay Xian'er, I definitely won't let you down."
<br><br>Yu Wujie straightened his clothes while taking out an ancient zither from his storage ring and sat down in the middle.
<br><br>And on his way over, he had long memorized the score, and referring to his memory, he slowly dropped his palm to the strings of the zither.
<br><br>"Dong dong dong dong ......"
<br><br>The prelude of the ordinary road, slowly sounded.
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>As soon as this prelude came out, Shu Qinhua, who was sitting on the side, immediately dropped her beautiful eyes onto Yu Wujie's body.
<br><br>The next moment, that Jiang Yu who was sitting on top of the zither platform.
<br><br>Also opened his eyes violently!
