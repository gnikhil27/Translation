"Lord Blackfeather."
<br><br>"Could it be that you can really swallow this breath?"
<br><br>And at one end of the raft, the three beasts of the Western Demon Forest and Black Feather were huddled together, and the three beasts of the Western Demon Forest couldn't help but send out a voice transmission towards Black Feather.
<br><br>"Of course I can't swallow it."
<br><br>Black Feather sent back a gloomy voice.
<br><br>A pair of bull-like eyes were filled with hatred.
<br><br>"Then why did you take this beating for nothing just now?"
<br><br>The Rhinoceros Forest Demon Immortal, the leader of the Western Demon Forest, couldn't help but ask: "Despite what you said about the importance of city and pattern, I thought carefully, in front of these few mole crickets, there was absolutely no need for us to hunker down ah, because we still had a chance if we rose up at that time."
<br><br>"Hmph, do you really think that my bowing down just now was because of this broken skull?" Black Feather couldn't help but hum.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"That's because?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>A few of the Western Demon Lin were suddenly confused.
<br><br>"Alas, you demons of this Immortal River Continent just can't have an IQ, no wonder the entire continent is controlled by humans, while you can only live inside the small forest." Black feather could not help but lecture.
<br><br>The rhinoceros forest a few black up face.
<br><br>But did not dare to retort, but the questioning eyes still looked at black feather, obviously to find out why.
<br><br>"To tell you the truth, just now I bowed my head, not because of this broken skeleton at all, but because of the other people on the island." Black Feather said in a deep voice: "Putting aside that horrible human first, the other people on the island are also troublesome."
<br><br>"Other people are also troublesome?"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin a few people more confused.
<br><br>Except for some brick-moving martial dwellers on this island, the others seemed to be very ordinary!
<br><br>What kind of trouble could this bring them?
<br><br>"Do you really think this island is as light as you guys think?"
<br><br>Black Feather said in a deep voice: "Except for those trash Martial Dignitaries, in fact, everyone else has the same cultivation as you guys, it's just that they hide it, plus your cultivation is bound, you can't detect it."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"How is this possible?"
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest were suddenly shocked.
<br><br>"Do not believe, then you take a good look, the old man in front of the boat."
<br><br>"Look back at the old woman fetching water for cooking on the edge of the island."
<br><br>"And the ones on the other side of the river fishing ......"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest hurriedly cast their eyes over and carefully surveyed.
<br><br>At first did not find anything, but despite the cultivation was bundled, but the foundation in them, soon found that these people are vaguely have a terrifying fluctuations.
<br><br>And this fluctuation makes the same cultivation they, extremely familiar.
<br><br>That is to say, all of these people are the previous ten life martial emperor, now the human immortal cultivation.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Several demons instantly drew a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>"So, you know why I bowed my head just now, right?"
<br><br>Black Feather said in a cold voice: "Because once the fight starts, even if that terrifying human doesn't make a move, just these people around will be able to make you all eat your words."
<br><br>"And although I am better, but with my cultivation being affected, they will also have a lot of trouble with me, overall speaking, it is still not safe."
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"It's really thanks to Lord Black Feather's discernment, and it's also fortunate that we didn't act rashly before, or else now ......"
<br><br>The rhinoceros forest three demons suddenly realized, at the same time can not help but wipe a cold sweat.
<br><br>Just now was really close ah!
<br><br>Because they understood that the terrifying formation on this island, not to mention that their cultivation was bound, even if they were in full bloom, they could not please.
<br><br>"So, in the absence of a choice, I just gave this trash skeleton low."
<br><br>Black feather then leisurely emitted a voice.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>"They can't bounce around for long."
<br><br>"We just need to wait for the time to make our move after this hot chicken skeleton takes us off this island."
<br><br>"By then, tsk ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Black Feather's voice gave a beat, and his eyes slowly turned grim.
<br><br>"Yes, when the time comes, new accounts and old accounts will be settled together!"
<br><br>Hearing this, the western demon forest's face is still scarce, and even take up the stubble to pass out a cold laugh.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, then this skeleton in front of you that offended Lord Black Feather, dismantled into pieces!"
