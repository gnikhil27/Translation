"Wait for me ah ......"
<br><br>Behind him, Rudrasheng quickly followed while lifting his pants.
<br><br>Under the foot of a certain mountain.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>With a sonic boom sounding, a youth flew out backwards.
<br><br>"Your disciples from the Blowing Snow Villa are no better than that, this time the sparring is won by my Wind and Cloud Valley."
<br><br>Another disciple said with a smile, and then put away the long sword in his hand.
<br><br>"Brother Cheng Wu is powerful."
<br><br>"Senior Brother Cheng Wu's strength is really terrifying!"
<br><br>And in the surroundings, there were also many disciples from other sects gathered around, and yelling sounds came out.
<br><br>Obviously, it is rare to have so many disciples gathered, so a temporary group of a place for sparring. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And this Cheng Wu of Windy Cloud Valley is a deservedly popular figure.
<br><br>Of course, he himself also has this capital.
<br><br>The young age, Martial Emperor strength, is one of the key training disciples of the Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>Some people said that, purely in terms of talent, only the Wind and Cloud Valley's Yun Xian Que was able to press him.
<br><br>"Haha, you are all welcome."
<br><br>"Is there anyone else who wants to spar with me?"
<br><br>Cheng Wu shouted loudly.
<br><br>However, no one was able to answer the fight for a while.
<br><br>"Good, since no one wants to challenge again, I will give everyone a rehearsal of a set of sword techniques I just learned."
<br><br>Saying that, Cheng Wu's long sword came out and swept through the air.
<br><br>At once, the whistling sound was pleasantly shocking, causing the surrounding air to rip and ring.
<br><br>"Stop the movement of your hands, or else, die!"
<br><br>At this moment, an abrupt voice sounded, breaking the atmosphere of the place.
<br><br>The crowd was instantly shocked.
<br><br>There was actually someone talking to Cheng Wu like this, and when they looked over, they found six figures walking over.
<br><br>An old man holding a cane and looking like he was about to die.
<br><br>A big man with an exposed belly and hairy chest.
<br><br>And four other bad old men who were equally oddly shaped and walked like they were about to fall.
<br><br>"Who are you people?"
<br><br>Cheng Wu looked at these old men and asked in a deep voice: "What business is it of yours what about me?"
<br><br>But just as his voice fell, the old man in the lead, knocked his head with a cane.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the crowd was stunned.
<br><br>These old men who didn't seem to have the slightest cultivation were actually so bold as to knock on Cheng Wu's head with a cane.
<br><br>Was this a case of not wanting to live?
<br><br>In the night.
<br><br>A green dress swept by, it was Li Yihan.
<br><br>Seeing that there are quite a few disciples gathered here, so she immediately rushed over towards this side.
<br><br>Because of these days, she was seriously injured, and the pills she had on her body had long been used up.
<br><br>She came here to see if she could meet someone she knew, or a disciple from the same clan, to ask for some healing pills.
<br><br>But as soon as she approached the place, a change occurred.
<br><br>Five old men and a big man seemed to be in conflict with the disciples of Wind Cloud Valley, but when she got closer and was able to see the appearance of these old men, her face changed dramatically.
<br><br>"These old men, how did they come here?"
<br><br>"Not to say that it was agreed that they should not run around at will, a few mortals actually started a conflict with the disciples of Wind and Cloud Valley, this consequence ......"
<br><br>Her face changed greatly as she increased her speed towards there.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that she just took two steps, that old man Wang knocked on Cheng Wu's head with a cane.
<br><br>Li Yihan's eyes fell down in fright.
<br><br>A mortal old man, actually using a cane to knock on a cultivator's head, how dare he, is he not afraid of death?
<br><br>"You seek death!"
<br><br>Sure enough, Cheng Wu let out an angry roar.
<br><br>"Apologize quickly, apologize quickly, these lifeless old men, if you don't apologize, those people will really want your lives."
<br><br>Li Yihan's heart was stuck to her throat, her face full of anxiety, while rushing to get there, her heart was praying.
<br><br>But what she did not expect was ......
<br><br>Facing Cheng Wu who was obviously angry, this old man Wang actually raised his cane again and fiercely knocked another cane on Cheng Wu's head.
<br><br>Ka!
<br><br>This old man ......
<br><br>Is he really not afraid of death?
<br><br>This is not the way to find death, right?
<br><br>Cheng Wu was furious, killing intent in his eyes, suddenly out of nowhere from the bad old man, actually bold enough to dare to provoke him.
<br><br>"Senior Brother Cheng Wu, please calm your anger."
<br><br>However, just as he was about to make his move, Li Yihan arrived and stopped in front of him.
<br><br>"Who are you?" Cheng Wu asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I am from the Shang Sha Li family, I hope Senior Brother Cheng Wu will give me face."
<br><br>Li Yihan's face was miserable white and he lowered his head and hurriedly explained, "These old men are mortals, they don't know Senior Brother Cheng Wu's identity, I hope Senior Brother Cheng Wu is generous and doesn't treat the old men in general, I'll ask them to apologize to you."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Shang Sha Li family?"
<br><br>Cheng Wu glanced at Li Yihan.
<br><br>Although the Shang Sha Li family wasn't a big family, he also knew that this Li family was a power that was dependent on him, Wind Cloud Valley.
<br><br>With a slight hesitation, he said, "Since they are from the Li family, and since they are a few mortals who are not open-minded, then I will give you face and tell them to apologize immediately, and I can bypass their lives."
<br><br>At these words, Li Yihan let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Then she hurriedly ran to a few people in front of old man Wang and scolded with a face full of anger, "What the hell is wrong with you few mortals, didn't I say that I told you not to run around?"
<br><br>Saying that, she glared her gaze at Old Man Wang.
<br><br>"Especially you, how dare you take a cane and knock someone's head, do you know what kind of people they are, they are the disciples of the great clan of Nansha, they are able to take your lives with their hands, why don't you hurry up and apologize to the others, or no one will be able to save you tonight."
