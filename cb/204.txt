Lightning threw the box in his hand, and shit splattered all over the floor.
<br><br>"Which god damned one is so pitiful?"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong's mouth roared, looking at the handful of shit, his forehead veins sprouted, and he had the heart to vomit blood.
<br><br>He was still proud that he had managed to seize this chest ahead of Yun Xian Que, so that he could wipe out his shame, but the reality was too great for him.
<br><br>Seeing this, the fifth formation and other people are also blue in the face.
<br><br>It is indescribable that the thing that was so easily grabbed is a piece of shit, this suffocation is indescribable!
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's face was also dull.
<br><br>When she reacted, she was filled with gloating.
<br><br>I'm afraid that now the fifth long air finally appreciate what she was feeling just now, so easy to rush in, but in exchange for a pile of rags.
<br><br>And at this time, the other experts also finally rushed here.
<br><br>When they saw that the holy relics were inexplicably destroyed and the holy gongfa and pills were burned, it caused a big wave of Xuan Yuan. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Especially when they knew that the two clans fought so fiercely and finally the fifth long sky grabbed a piece of shit, the crowd didn't know what to say.
<br><br>"Alas, Miss, you really missed a heavenly opportunity ah, you see no movement inside the tomb, where there is what you say what danger?"
<br><br>Outside the ancient tomb, the two Yang Mu were still full of reluctance to blame Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>But now, apart from sighing, there was nothing they could do, because even if they rushed in now, the yellow flowers would be cold.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's face was ugly.
<br><br>Could it be that what Lu Qingshan said was really not spiritual?
<br><br>If that was the case, then she had indeed let Wind and Cloud Valley lose a heavenly chance for nothing.
<br><br>Just then, they were surprised to find that there were actually three or two cultivators walking out of the door.
<br><br>"Why did they come out so quickly?"
<br><br>Yang Mu was filled with doubts and could not help but gently swipe, stopping in front of those two cultivators and asking the reason.
<br><br>"Alas, don't mention it, this tomb has long been short-changed!" One of them shook his head and said, "By the time we get in there, there's no hair left."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yang Mu several people immediately shocked.
<br><br>Especially Yun Xian Que, a thunderbolt rang out in his head.
<br><br>It was really as Lu Qingshan said.
<br><br>The treasures inside had actually been short-changed?
<br><br>"What the hell is going on, can you say something clearer?" Yun Xian Que asked incredulously, "How in the world did this treasure get short-changed?"
<br><br>"Such an evil thing who knows, after all, before we went in, the organs are still there, it is reasonable to say that no one can go in." The monk said with a helpless face: "So now everyone is staring at it!"
<br><br>"This can't be right?"
<br><br>This kind of thing is really unbelievable, Yang Mu seems to have some difficulty accepting it, and asked, "By the way, what about the three holy relics, did the Snow Blower Villa and the Heavenly Sword Sect get them?"
<br><br>"The three holy relics, not to mention, for this matter, those two sects are holding back there." The cultivator shook his head: "After fighting for most of the day, it was hard to rush in, only to find that the holy relics have long been destroyed!"
<br><br>"Destroyed, destroyed?"
<br><br>Yang Mu two people incredibly widened their eyes, and could not help but ask: "Could it be that they two major sects, just did not get anything?"
<br><br>"The Fifth Long Sky didn't get nothing!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, the faces of those two cultivators became wonderfully pale.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yang Mu several people immediately became nervous and hurriedly asked, "What is the good stuff?"
<br><br>"A piece of shit!"
<br><br>The cultivator shook his head and said with a complicated face.
<br><br>"A dog?"
<br><br>"Shit?"
<br><br>The few people of Yang Mu stared in disbelief and directly stood in place.
<br><br>"Sure enough, what Lu Qingshan said is spiritual!" Yun Xian Que said with an incredulous expression on his face.
<br><br>The two Yang Mu were speechless, their faces filled with disbelief.
<br><br>It was also never expected that this thing had really come true.
<br><br>"Right Miss, but didn't Lu Qingshan also say that there is still a great danger in this tomb?" Yang Mu remembered something else and asked: "Now it's just a spiritual test that the treasure was short-changed, but this tomb looks like there is no danger!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que also nodded his head.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan also said that there was an even more terrifying crisis in this tomb than before.
<br><br>Just then, the earth shuddered.
<br><br>Then under the gaze of Yun Xian Que and others, the original hall and passage of the tomb in front of them began to collapse.
<br><br>With the collapse of the hall and the passage, the Fifth Longkong and others who were at the altar were also exposed to the surface.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Everyone looked around vigilantly, and then under the gaze of everyone, the stone door behind the altar suddenly emitted a golden light.
<br><br>Under the golden light flash, a shadow appeared in mid-air.
<br><br>He was tall and imposing, obviously just a shadow, but it brought a great pressure to the people present.
<br><br>"This?"
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>"Is this the Jiang Yu Martial Saint himself?"
<br><br>"Oh my, I actually saw a Martial Saint!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the crowd present fell into a frenzy, and voices of astonishment came out.
<br><br>"That's right, I am Jiang Yu!"
<br><br>Finally, the golden light coalesced into a shadow, looking down at the crowd below in a condescending posture, and emitted a voice as thick as an ancient bell.
<br><br>"It's really Martial Saint Jiang Yu!"
<br><br>"Oh my!"
<br><br>"Greetings, Martial Saint Jiang Yu."
<br><br>"Greetings, Lord Martial Saint!"
<br><br>The crowd bowed, even the people from the three major powers were no exception, after all, someone who could reach such a level as a Martial Saint was definitely an existence that made people respect.
<br><br>"Without further ado, I sat down ten thousand years ago, but before I sat down there was one thing I was not happy about, and that was that no one passed on my mantle."
<br><br>"Therefore, before sitting down, I left this tomb, hoping to find someone to get my legacy today, ten thousand years later!"
<br><br>The bell-like voice spread all around.
<br><br>Once this voice came out, all the people present were showing excitement, eyes flashing with intense enthusiasm.
<br><br>The crowd originally thought that today's treasure to end in failure, but did not expect such a turn of events.
<br><br>The inheritance of the Martial Saint.
<br><br>Phew.
<br><br>Can be more important than what the holy weapon ah!
<br><br>"Dare to ask senior, how can I have a chance to get your inheritance?"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong asked with a face full of fervor.
<br><br>As he asked the question, all the people present looked towards Jiang Yu.
