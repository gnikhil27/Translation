"You have to save me, White Family Master."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian's face was bloodless, and a crying voice came out of his mouth as his palms clutched onto Bai Leader Tian.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Bai Leader Tian heaved a sigh.
<br><br>At the same time, he got rid of Yuen Long Tian's palm and shook his head, "This kind of thing, no one can save you unless the king of Wu Tian can be enlightened."
<br><br>"But, but it's because of you that I committed such a big thing!" Yuen Long Tian shouted reluctantly.
<br><br>"It's true that this matter started because of me, but you also have to understand that if we go down together and both Yuan and Bai families lose their main backbone, what will be the consequences for the two families in the future?" White Leader Tian's pupils shrank and his gaze was fixed on Yuen Long Tian and said word by word.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian was struck by lightning.
<br><br>His face turned white as he sat down on the ground.
<br><br>If it was really like what Bai Lin Tian said, the consequences were really unthinkable. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>If there was no backbone, the two great clans would sooner or later be targeted and go into decline from then on, walk into the abyss, and eventually die out in the long river of time.
<br><br>"Good thing I was lucky, I woke up in time, and did not make a big mistake!"
<br><br>White Collar Sky sighed: "So rest assured, if the Wu Tian kingdom ruler is really moved by this and wants you to die to thank for your crime, I will help you support the Yuan family until your Yuan family has the next main backbone that can hold up the situation."
<br><br>"Okay ...... okay!"
<br><br>Even though his heart was full of reluctance, Yuen Long Tian had no choice and nodded his head with difficulty.
<br><br>"Just now my request for an audience, sir did not pay attention to, I'm afraid is not want to see us such a small person, so this matter I must be the first time to report to the king!" White collar day and solemnly explained: "Therefore I have to depart immediately, your words, seize the time to go back to the Yuan family to explain matters, and then wait for the king's sentence!"
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian nodded his head with a shriveled face.
<br><br>White Leader Tian patted Yuen Long Tian's shoulder and said softly comfortingly, "Let's go, I'll send Shadow to go over with you, he can help you get rid of some tricky matters as soon as possible ......"
<br><br>"Wait ......"
<br><br>"Shadow?"
<br><br>As soon as he thought of Shadow, he suddenly remembered something else that made him feel terrible.
<br><br>And Yuen Long Tian, whose face was shriveled, also had a glare in his eyes.
<br><br>The two of them looked at each other in unison.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Both of them remembered this matter.
<br><br>It was because back then at the dinner party, Wu Tian Guojun had talked about another person besides that gentleman.
<br><br>Recalling the scene of that night, the two people were vividly remembering.
<br><br>Wu Tian Guojun sat at the top, his lazy posture with a faint intoxication, his eyes full of memories and reluctance.
<br><br>He said: If that gentleman was his initiation teacher on the path of cultivation, then this one was his good big brother.
<br><br>His good elder brother was not tall, a servant of the gentleman, and would always be put into a loose black robe by the gentleman, looking comical and funny.
<br><br>But don't look at this appearance, he is the strongest expert I've ever seen, except for Mr.
<br><br>Even if I am now the number one man in the empire, I can't match one finger of my big brother.
<br><br>My big brother likes women.
<br><br>Likes wine.
<br><br>Likes to sing and dance.
<br><br>Likes to play music.
<br><br>When he said this, they clearly remembered that Wu Tian Guojun waved his hand and shouted at them, "Don't stop the music, keep playing, keep dancing."
<br><br>While the scene was joyful and the atmosphere was warm, Wu Tian Guojun even brought the whole crowd to his face and said without any scruples, "As I recall, my first time was because my good elder brother stole thirty gold coins from the gentleman and took me up to the red building."
<br><br>"At that time, I was ignorant, red-faced, and lasted for so little time."
<br><br>"Speaking of which, that woman was really not very good-looking."
<br><br>"But recalling, that was my happiest, happiest time!"
<br><br>"In addition to that, big brother took me down to the river to touch shrimp, catch chickens in the fields, and eat grasshoppers on the grassland."
<br><br>"Alas ...... If I could go back to the time when I followed my big brother, this king of the country would not be appropriate!"
<br><br>Many scenes of that night, the words of the kingdom of Wu Tian, surfaced in the minds of the two people ...... white collar days and Yuen Long days
<br><br>Once thought of this, the two turned into streams of light towards the front hall and rushed away.
<br><br>And at the same time as rushing away, Bai Lingtian's heart was secretly praying that nothing would happen, nothing would happen.
<br><br>But just as the two of them arrived at the front hall, there was a huge commotion from the front hall.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A burst of sound.
<br><br>It shook the sky and the earth.
<br><br>Then they saw that a black shadow flew backwards like a meteor, and then fell unconscious on the ground.
<br><br>White Leader Tian and Yuen Long Tian were shocked to the core.
<br><br>Jairus stared.
<br><br>Because they saw with their own eyes, the black-robed man sitting at the head seat, just raised his finger, and then injured the shadow like this.
<br><br>How terrifying should this strength be?
<br><br>They could not imagine!
<br><br>But it instantly became clear in their hearts that the guess in their hearts was right, he was afraid that he was none other than the good elder brother of the Lord State Monarch.
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei, who Lord Monarch called the most handsome man in the world!
<br><br>And Yuan Jing, who followed behind, also saw this scene and instantly covered her red lips.
<br><br>The beautiful eyes widened.
<br><br>Who didn't know about Shadow's strength in this Yuancheng?
<br><br>Yet, he was flicked away by a finger of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>Is that the one that Yi Feng said, the trash who can't cultivate?!!!
