This stumping.
<br><br>It can be said to be his most astute layout.
<br><br>He had arranged countless formations on this game, and moving any piece would be able to activate the formation, allowing him to save his life.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Everything in the world has a break.
<br><br>This chess game of his is no different, only one specific piece will destroy the entire game.
<br><br>And this is a broken game, only when one sees through the real chess dao can one find out that particular piece.
<br><br>And I am afraid that the person who has seen through the chess dao is not found in the whole Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>At this moment Yi Feng.
<br><br>But in an instant, he found the chess piece that broke the game, broke the game, and at the same time destroyed Wu Chang'an's entire chessboard layout. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>It is so.
<br><br>All of Wu Chang'an's layout, from the 1.1 billion doppelganger's blindfold at the beginning, to the teleportation formation of the flower pot at the entrance, to this broken chess game, were all seen through by Yi Feng.
<br><br>All of Wu Chang'an's cards were pierced like thin paper in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an had a deadly look on his face.
<br><br>Only now did he understand why this man did not kill him.
<br><br>I'm afraid it was to play him like this, to make him fearful, to make him desperate, to make all his tactics come to naught, to slowly torture him.
<br><br>And at this point, Yi Feng started the system to detect the whole clan once.
<br><br>Surprisingly everyone's was too lazy to detect.
<br><br>Of course, there is only one exception.
<br><br>That is the Wu Changan in front of him.
<br><br>The test learned that Wu Changan is ordinary qualification, and what does ordinary qualification represent?
<br><br>It is a mortal.
<br><br>In other words, the Wu Chang'an in front of him was a mortal who was unable to cultivate, just like him.
<br><br>It was so.
<br><br>Yi Feng came to a conclusion.
<br><br>The ones that the system was too lazy to detect were cultivators that he couldn't afford to mess with, and the ones that could be detected should be mortals.
<br><br>So lazy to detect, do not mess with.
<br><br>Can detect, rest assured that boldly dry.
<br><br>Looking at Wu Changan has been dull, but also with a little afraid of his look, Yi Feng understood.
<br><br>It is estimated that Wu Chang'an thought he was a cultivator, living together would bully him, only to look so fearful.
<br><br>Rather, he thought too much.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Tao, ah, you don't have to be afraid, we are actually a class of people." Yi Feng said meaningfully.
<br><br>"A class of people?"
<br><br>Wu Changan's body trembled.
<br><br>What did he mean by that?
<br><br>"A meeting gift for you." Yi Feng took out a sculpture from his pocket and handed it to Wu Chang'an.
<br><br>And this sculpture was the more satisfactory one among all his sculptures.
<br><br>The reason why he gave it to Wu Changan was also because Yi Feng knew in his heart that as a newcomer, he needed to have a good relationship with his roommate, and besides two mortals in this kind of sect, they needed to hug each other for warmth even more.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an did not know what the devil in front of him meant, subconsciously took the sculpture handed to him by Yi Feng.
<br><br>However, do not look at it, a look scared.
<br><br>"Ao ...... Ultraman?"
<br><br>Mouth dry, he immediately recognized what this statue is, his eyes are about to stare out.
<br><br>Why.
<br><br>Why in this other world, can see the carving of Ultraman?
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>He violently remembered Yi Feng's words just now ......
<br><br>"We are one of a kind."
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>At the thought of this, Wu Changan's body trembled violently.
<br><br>In other words.
<br><br>This demon in front of him came from the same place as he did?
<br><br>Knowing this news, Wu Changan didn't know whether to be happy or sad.
<br><br>Perhaps in the past, he would see the hometown, two eyes tearful, but forced to this person's powerful, he is how the tears can not up.
<br><br>Moreover, this person's real purpose, he could not guess until now.
<br><br>And did not kill him.
<br><br>But then ran over to tell him with action, you Wu Changan is unable to escape my palm, all the means in my eyes are bubbles.
<br><br>After giving him a downward spiral, then told him that the two came from the same place, and also sent a powerful aura filled with Ultraman.
<br><br>Wu Changan's heart is in turmoil.
<br><br>Guessing and guessing, but also did not guess Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>But let him breathe a sigh of relief is that now his should not be in danger of life.
<br><br>As for continuing to escape, Wu Chang'an heart assessment, with Yi Feng's means to escape in front of him mortality rate is 100 percent.
<br><br>So, wait and see what happens may have a chance.
<br><br>"It seems that the next step can only take one step."
<br><br>Wu Changan exhaled a foul breath and silently followed Yi Feng into the room.
<br><br>Return to the First Hall.
<br><br>The four patriarchs looked at the information in their hands and their faces were extremely unpleasant.
<br><br>"Night Energy Night Yi father and daughter destroyed a mysterious organization."
<br><br>"Night Neng fought alone and took out three men in black, all three of which were Ten Life Martial Emperors."
<br><br>"Night Neng's daughter, Night Yi, obtained an ancient inheritance in the North Sea, and her strength has once again improved greatly."
<br><br>"According to some people's speculation, the two father and daughter of the Night Family have broken through the Human Immortal and become the Earth Immortal realm."
<br><br>"The Night Family, in one leap, has become the strongest power in the North Sea."
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>After reading these news, the four patriarchs slapped the table and stood up violently.
<br><br>"This Night Energy, previously one realm lower than us, what makes him so strong now?"
<br><br>"I think, it must be that senior's guidance in Guan Tang City, otherwise how could he not have broken through so many realms in such a short period of time."
<br><br>"Yes, this dog said the night can, when agreed to find seniors together, but eat alone, I saw certainly can not spare him."
<br><br>"Humph, can't spare him, you can now beat him half a finger?"
<br><br>At that, several people sat down sarcastically.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>Now encounter the night can, four people together may not be able to beat him that finger.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>At this time, Li Canghai stood up again and said firmly, "No matter what, I have to find that senior."
<br><br>"Yes, we must find that senior, why should Night Energy be able to get the chance, we can't." Liu Gu Yi also spoke similarly.
<br><br>"Good, several of us work together and act together."
<br><br>For a while, several people made up their minds, their hearts filled with determination.
<br><br>Finally: mention a mouth system detection settings, afraid that some people can not read, the system upgraded after the system, the following immortal trash are too lazy to detect, immortal above the detection results, low-level immortal is super trash.
