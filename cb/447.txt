The aura of the statue became stronger and stronger.
<br><br>At the same time blossomed with a dazzling light.
<br><br>The light is like a blazing sun like blinding, spare to white shallow one also can not help but squint the eyes.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>When the light dazzling to the extreme, a shadow came out of the wooden statue, and then gradually solidified.
<br><br>His eyes indifferent look at white shallow one, a auspicious cloud robe windless, surrounded by blue light.
<br><br>"Never seen before, and does not belong to the Immortal River Continent, much less the power of the Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi narrowed her eyes at the man in front of her and revealed a wary look.
<br><br>It was because she felt a strong threat in this man's body.
<br><br>In particular, the power that was released from his body was something that Bai Shouyi had never seen before.
<br><br>"Goddess, let me deal with him." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>One of the old men saw this, a powerful aura burst out from his body, the long sword in his hand came out, a ten thousand feet sword light immediately flashed and slashed towards the man.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Faced with this sword, the man remained expressionless, but inclined his head and extended his right hand.
<br><br>"Ten Thousand Elephants Heavenly Guide."
<br><br>A cold and indifferent voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Visible to the naked eye, a mysterious black hole appeared in the palm of his right hand.
<br><br>An invisible fluctuation spread out in all directions and wrapped towards the old man.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The old man's sword broke without attack, and his body was even uncontrollably sucked over.
<br><br>Under this powerful attraction, no matter how much the old man struggled, he could not escape at all.
<br><br>Almost instantly, the old man's body was sucked into the man's hands and was tightly squeezed around the neck.
<br><br>The man's palm pressed down, and the old man's body was smashed heavily on the ground.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The ground smashed out a big crater.
<br><br>At the same time, with the old man's body as the center point, the ground cracks were like spider webs, spreading out in all directions, and within a half mile radius, all the houses collapsed.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The faces of Bai Shallow and the others finally changed.
<br><br>The old man's Heavenly Immortal strength actually could not pass a single move in front of this man?
<br><br>"Rescue."
<br><br>Bai Shallow One shouted, and made his move at the same time as the other old man, and the two of them enveloped powerful attacks towards the man.
<br><br>And taking advantage of the gap in the man's dodge, the wounded old man was only considered to be saved.
<br><br>"Three people joined forces."
<br><br>White shallow one felt unprecedented gloom.
<br><br>What's more, he couldn't see through what kind of power the man was using.
<br><br>The two old men hurriedly nodded, and the power of the immortals spread out from their bodies, attacking towards the man from three directions.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Facing the three men's attacks, the man took it in stride, his auspicious black robe turning into a stream of light as he weaved through the battlefield.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>An old man was knocked out.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Another punch, another old man was knocked out again.
<br><br>Under the powerful power attack, countless buildings in Baier City collapsed one after another, fortunately, the Baier City crowd had all fled as soon as Bai Shallow killed someone, which did not cause any other deaths or injuries.
<br><br>"Good, so strong!"
<br><br>The four patriarchs hidden in the shadows, looking at the man who had defeated three with one and still had the upper hand, had already been wide-eyed, and various unbelievable sounds came out of their mouths.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>The hearts of the four people regretted.
<br><br>Regret that just now when Bai Shangyi wanted to kill the night can two, did not rescue.
<br><br>Perhaps their rescue was ineffective, but it was enough to represent their attitude.
<br><br>This made them regret their intestines.
<br><br>Had they known that the one statue posed by the Green Ox Sect was so strong, they would not have hesitated to stand in line.
<br><br>But now.
<br><br>It was too late to say anything.
<br><br>Even if they strike now, the meaning is different.
<br><br>The four of them sighed.
<br><br>Another opportunity was placed in front of them, and they did not seize it.
<br><br>On the other hand, the two father and daughter of Night Energy raised their heads and looked at the man in the auspicious cloud robe with his feet in the void, filled with admiration.
<br><br>"Is this the power of sir?"
<br><br>"It's hard to imagine that the power of just one statue has beaten the three Bai Shao Yi so badly." Night Yi said with a face full of awe, "No wonder sir has never put this Bai Shanyi in his eyes since the beginning."
<br><br>"No, this is not Mister's power."
<br><br>Night Energy, however, corrected cautiously, "To be precise, this is only Little Dance girl's power."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Only then did Night Yi react.
<br><br>The statue in front of her was not carved by Yi Feng, but only came from Xiaodai, who he had taught.
<br><br>"Mister is only a disciple taught out by half a month, and its statue has this kind of strength, if it is a statue carved out by mister himself, what kind of prevailing might should it have?" Night Yi couldn't help but speculate.
<br><br>"I'm afraid ......"
<br><br>"Out of the scene will be able to kill white shallow one of them!"
<br><br>Night Energy guessed.
<br><br>Night Yi nodded solemnly, her heart floating this that white-robed figure, her eyes filled with a strong admiration.
<br><br>"Goddess, this person's strength is too bizarre, only able to use the immortal method to suppress and kill."
<br><br>Two old men in rags, mouth sharply breathing at the same time, clustered around the body of Bai Shanyi gruffly shouted.
<br><br>"OK."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi narrowed his eyes, his pupils fiercely shrunk.
<br><br>Then the white palm of his hand raised and the Immortal Force covered towards the sky.
<br><br>"Freeze a thousand miles."
<br><br>"Ka ka ka ka ......"
<br><br>As she let out a soft cry, the sky froze with a force visible to the naked eye, covering towards the man.
<br><br>"Heavenly fire."
<br><br>An old man made hand seals extremely quickly, and a huge ball of fire coalesced from the sky, enveloping towards the man at the same time.
<br><br>"Heavenly Storm."
<br><br>Another old man was also not willing to show his weakness, strongly holding on to his injuries as he cast hand seals, and over the entire Baier City, a large storm coalesced and swept towards the man.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Under the joint efforts of the three Bai Shao Yi, storms, flames, and frost were intermingled, and the entire Baier City sky had turned into a purgatory.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the face of all these attacks, the black-robed man just looked at them indifferently.
<br><br>Only a glance.
<br><br>Then, the palm of his hand slowly extended.
<br><br>And the moment his palm was extended, countless rocks and mud rose up from the ground and swept towards the three Bai Shao Yi from all directions.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>It was like clay, staining the three Bai Shayi, making them unable to move and break free.
<br><br>The three people's attack, once again, did not break.
<br><br>Also at the same time, more clay wrapped around them and covered them in it.
<br><br>Looking from a distance.
<br><br>A huge ball of earth condensed in the sky of Baier City, just like an asteroid, hovering in the sky of Baier City.
<br><br>It covered the sky and shrouded Baier City in a large shadow.
<br><br>"Earthburst Sky Star."
<br><br>Finally, when the earth ball condensed to the critical point, the man coldly uttered a voice.
<br><br>With that.
<br><br>The palm of his hand gently squeezed.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>The earth ball trembled violently and steeply tightened.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Whether it was Night Energy or the four patriarchs, their hearts were stuck in their throats.
<br><br>They also felt their mouths go dry.
<br><br>Just how powerful that sudden tightening force, just from the body's senses to feel it.
<br><br>That was wrapped within the white shallow a class of people ......
<br><br>Dead?
<br><br>They stared dead at the earth ball in the sky, trying to find the answer.
<br><br>Finally, after a few moments, the earth ball in the sky began to slowly dissolve, turning into a piece of rock, falling from the sky.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>A few people's pupils shrank.
<br><br>Because they clearly caught that there were three corpses that had become distorted and inhuman, landing from the sky.
<br><br>And from the tattered clothing to distinguish, it is none other than the three Bai Shao Yi.
<br><br>In the North Sea, the North Sea, so that many experts throughout the North Sea even dare not breathe a breath of white shallow one, really just like this ......
<br><br>dead?
<br><br>The crowd is all shocked words can not say.
<br><br>The mouth collectively draws a cold breath.
<br><br>And what makes them even more unbelievable is that Bai Shanyi's death is similar to a second kill.
<br><br>Because all this seems long, in fact, from the man in black out of the statue, but also a dozen sucking time.
<br><br>And he seems to have used only two moves since the beginning!!!
