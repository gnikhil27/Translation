"Xian'er?"
<br><br>The faces of the Heavenly Sword Sect crowd, including Duan Qingfeng and the others, all changed and fiercely looked towards Peng Xian'er who was beside them.
<br><br>For a moment.
<br><br>Countless gazes gathered on Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Master, all the elders, don't listen to their nonsense, I really didn't do anything." Peng Xian'er's face turned pale as she hurriedly opened her mouth to explain.
<br><br>Then she raised her head towards the fifth Tian Ming and the others and said, "Seniors, it's true that the strength of the junior is inferior to yours, but you can't allow such a slander."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Slander?"
<br><br>"You really don't know how to repent even when you are dead."
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu said in a condescending manner, "You, who are not open-minded, actually captured Mister to the Heavenly Sword Sect, do you really think that you can vaguely pass it by not admitting it?"
<br><br>"Sir, what sir?" Duan Qingfeng asked. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"What sir did you say it was?" Yang Tianyu coldly snorted, "Naturally, it's the supreme master who recently came to my Nansha, and your precious disciple captured him to the Heavenly Sword Sect!"
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>However, Peng Xian'er laughed coldly, "Senior Yang, although I don't know when I offended you, but don't you have to find a better reason for slandering me?"
<br><br>"What kind of heavenly cultivation is that supreme master from Nansha, and what kind of virtue do I, Peng Xian'er, have to be able to capture him to my Heavenly Sword Sect?"
<br><br>"Although I did capture a mortal two days ago, but you guys can't possibly slander me by treating that mortal as that gentleman ......"
<br><br>But when she said this, her expression suddenly stalled.
<br><br>Because she remembered something fiercely.
<br><br>Mortal Mortal ......
<br><br>Mortal ......
<br><br>Could it be ......
<br><br>At this moment, she remembered Yi Feng who disappeared in the prisoner dragon domain, remembered the demonic beast that turned into a dead body, and remembered many, many details ......
<br><br>And all these details are also all right.
<br><br>Can't help but, her face suddenly changed, her paws fiercely backed up a few steps.
<br><br>"No, this can't be, this can't be, how is this possible ......"
<br><br>"How can he be a mortal who is a supreme master, he is obviously a waste, this is simply impossible ......"
<br><br>Her mouth chanted sharply, denying ......
<br><br>Because she was completely unable to accept this fact.
<br><br>How could this mortal, who was once abandoned by her, be the supreme master in the eyes of countless people?
<br><br>"It must be a mistake on your part, this is simply impossible." She hissed in an urgent voice towards Yang Tianyu and the others.
<br><br>"Mistake?"
<br><br>Fifth Tian Ming sneered, Martial Saint's mighty pressure blasted out as he said in a deep voice, "I will then ask you, did you privately go to Plum Immortal City and capture someone?"
<br><br>"To tell you the truth, the mortal you captured in the Plum Immortal City is none other than Mister, Mister feel the mortal heart, feel the ordinary life, but you are good, but you have arrested Mister, and even brought him to your Heavenly Sword Sect, I ask you, what crime should you be!"
<br><br>As soon as the word Mei Xiancheng entered her ears, it was like an explosive thunderstorm blasting in Peng Xian'er's mind.
<br><br>This information broke the last line of defense in Peng Xian'er's heart.
<br><br>Because at that time.
<br><br>She had indeed caught Yi Feng in Mei Xian City.
<br><br>"No, no, no ......"
<br><br>"It won't happen ......"
<br><br>"It can't be ......"
<br><br>But even though all the information was right, Peng Xian'er was still unwilling to admit this fact, with a miserable white face and her paws hastily retreating while desperately denying this fact.
<br><br>Because no matter how she could not understand, this and he grew up, even the problem of eating mortal, and how can be that supreme master!
<br><br>This kind of thing, is really too absurd.
<br><br>And at this time, Duan Qingfeng apparently also understood that the supreme expert who traveled in Nansha and made countless experts in Nansha try their best to please, was captured by Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>Although he also found it hard to believe, but at this moment he got a major news.
<br><br>That is, two days ago Peng Xian'er had opened the Dragon Prisoner Domain and imprisoned a mortal in it.
<br><br>And the time, just before the Heavenly Sword Sect's mountain gate was in turmoil.
<br><br>So even though he couldn't believe this, but after a comparison, a little association will be able to understand that the mortal who was imprisoned by Peng Xian'er, is the supreme master.
<br><br>No wonder ......
<br><br>No wonder his Heavenly Sword Sect is good, how even the mountain door foundation was destroyed, it turns out that this disciple of his did a good thing.
<br><br>"You really have a lot of nerve ...... to cause my Heavenly Sword Sect so miserable ah ......"
<br><br>At the thought of this, Duan Qingfeng was so angry that he pointed at Peng Xian'er and vomited blood in anger.
<br><br>Obviously, it was because of his disciple, thus causing the entire Heavenly Sword Sect's mountain gate to be destroyed, and also surrounded by several major sects to ask for punishment.
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er rushed to Duan Qingfeng with tears in her eyes and hurriedly said, "Master Master, don't believe them, the one I caught is really just a mortal, and this mortal is really just a waste, believe me, it's really just a waste."
<br><br>"Bastard, you actually dare to sophistry, kneel down for me."
<br><br>The extremely grief-stricken Duan Qingfeng's palm moved and countless hand seals fell on Peng Xian'er's body, instantly sealing off her cultivation and bringing her to her knees heavily.
<br><br>And at this moment, the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect also instantly became red-eyed.
<br><br>The Heavenly Sword Sect was their home to them, but just now, the home they had lived in for countless years had turned into a ruin.
<br><br>Before, they didn't know what the reason was at all.
<br><br>But now, he finally understood that it was Peng Xian'er who had caused hundreds of thousands of their Heavenly Sword Sect disciples to lose their mountain gate.
<br><br>"Kill her."
<br><br>"Kill her!"
<br><br>"Peel her skin."
<br><br>"I'll eat her flesh."
<br><br>"Hate!"
<br><br>"She must be killed."
<br><br>At this moment, countless disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect let out a roar like a clamor, implicating hundreds of thousands of them and causing them to lose their mountain sect due to one person's brain-dead act, they just couldn't stand it.
<br><br>There were even many people who rushed towards Peng Xian'er with red eyes, wanting to kill her with their own hands.
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>The Heavenly Sword Sect's saintly maiden, who had previously stood tall, was like a rat in the street at this moment, everyone shouted at her.
<br><br>And under so many hateful eyes and noisy cries, Peng Xian'er was trembling with fear, crawling towards Duan Qingfeng with trembling palms, miserably praying, "Master, save me, save me, I really didn't know that trash was that gentleman ah, I really always thought he was a trash ah, this can't be blamed on me ah!"
