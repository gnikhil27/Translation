As the voice fell, everyone present looked at the voice.
<br><br>Then they saw, a black-robed black man with boiling Qing, and a black bear a centipede, swept down from the sky.
<br><br>"My son."
<br><br>"It's the third prince."
<br><br>"It's the Third Prince who has returned."
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, all the people of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan were emitting excited voices.
<br><br>Since the last war between the Imperial Clan and the Red Sun Clan, although Bo Qing did not return that day, he had established a position in the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan.
<br><br>So when the tribe was facing a crisis but could not do anything, the appearance of Bo Qing directly gave them a backbone.
<br><br>All of them greeted Bo Qing and the others, greeting each other with various familiarity.
<br><br>"Father, mother, all the elders."
<br><br>Bo Qing greeted familiarly, and then introduced Bonehead Ben Wei and the others. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"This is my elder brother, this is my third brother Night Wind and fourth brother Black Bear Milkman."
<br><br>"Hello guys."
<br><br>Seeing that it was the people brought back by Boiling Qing, Ao Zhong and others also greeted enthusiastically.
<br><br>However, Ao Qingcheng's face was complicated, biting her red lips tightly not knowing what to do.
<br><br>On the one hand, she is very anxious to boil Qing back.
<br><br>On the other hand, she was also a little afraid to face Bo Qing, after all, the two of them were just too complicated, and if it wasn't for Little Wolf, she would have killed herself as early as when the Red Sun lineage was destroyed.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>However, just as the crowd greeted, a huge pressure of might was released from Milk Leopard Li's body.
<br><br>With that.
<br><br>An icy voice came out of his mouth, "You guys are lively, just, aren't you overlooking something?"
<br><br>After the voice fell, her mighty pressure crushed the entire field.
<br><br>With these words, the crowd of Heaven Devouring Demon Wolves in the joy of Simmering Qing's return was directly pulled back to reality, and suddenly their faces were grave, realizing that although Simmering Qing had returned, the crisis was still not lifted yet.
<br><br>And boiling Qing can not lift the crisis in the end?
<br><br>You know, milk leopard Li stood there emitting the pressure, but it is real, although boiling Qing solved the red sun lineage, but the specific strength in the end how, the crowd is not bottom ah.
<br><br>Can't help but, all sorts of chattering voices came out.
<br><br>"The third prince's breath doesn't seem to be strong ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, it doesn't look like a match for this Milk Leopard Li."
<br><br>"How can this be?"
<br><br>The crowd was immediately worried, and most of them even thought at this moment that even if Bo Qing had returned, they were still powerless.
<br><br>Can't help but, the crowd rose to the idea of taking a step back.
<br><br>Consider whether to directly hand over the seven coyotes to Milk Leopard Li, after all, when you think about it in a good way, this is really good for the seven coyotes, and even let the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan directly ride on the Western Demon Forest as a backing mountain.
<br><br>"What kind of little creeper are you, pushing and chattering here, have you been told to speak?" However, in the face of Milk Leopard Li's gesture, Bones Ben Wei was directly unwilling, with his arms crossed, he immediately screamed out a curse.
<br><br>The moment Bone Ben Wei's words came out, it immediately stimulated the nerves of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>All along, although and milk leopard Li arrogant, but at least did not tear the face.
<br><br>The Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan did not want to provoke such a big enemy, and Milk Leopard Li also wanted to take away the coyote, so both sides kept a tacit understanding, always retaining a hint of room for peace talks.
<br><br>The two sides have maintained a tacit understanding, always keeping a margin of peace. But the words of Skeleton Ben Wei have directly broken the window paper.
<br><br>How could the demon emperor experts of the Western Demon Forest withstand such provocation?
<br><br>"Third prince, tell this big brother of yours to be careful what he says."
<br><br>"Yes, he is a demon emperor, it's too impulsive to talk like this."
<br><br>"Calling you back is mainly to settle things with the other side through negotiations, not to directly tear the face, for no reason to erect a big enemy ah."
<br><br>For a time, a worried voice came out from the mouth of Ao Zhong and others.
