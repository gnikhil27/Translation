"Why?"
<br><br>A million doubts rose in her heart.
<br><br>Luo Lanxue and Yin Luolie's identities were unknown in the Castle Peak Sect, and a character like her was nothing more than a small transparency in front of the two women.
<br><br>And yet they were so respectful to Yi Feng, a mortal?
<br><br>It even seems that they are fighting against Wu Jie, as if it is because of this man she abandoned?
<br><br>Why in the end.
<br><br>Peng Ying's heart turned into a mess, a feeling of mist appeared in front of her eyes, so that she could not see through to feel ......
<br><br>"I also hope that you do not take this matter to heart, this person I will report to the clan, will certainly give you an explanation." Luo Lanxue said with her head lowered in apprehension.
<br><br>"Good point, good point."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and laughed, although he was quite angry with Wu Jie, but seeing him in this miserable state was also relieved for a while.
<br><br>At the same time the heart also very appreciated the Castle Peak Gate. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This door style is really good, I heard before, the Castle Peak Gate has a ban, not to be able to casually to mortals, before not much believe, now it seems, it is really so.
<br><br>In a group of people cautious gesture, this will invite Yi Feng into the inner hall to take a seat.
<br><br>However, the matter of receiving Yi Feng was left to Yin Xiong, Luo Lanxue and Yin Luolie had more important things to do.
<br><br>The two women walked out with icy faces, looking at Yu Wujie who was like a dead dog on the ground, with a murderous glint in their eyes.
<br><br>"Senior sister, what should we do?" Yin Luo Li asked.
<br><br>"After all, he is the Third Elder's disciple, we can't take action without permission, after going back to the Mountain Sect, report to the Master before making a decision." Luo Lanxue said with an icy face.
<br><br>Yin Luo Li nodded, and then turned her gaze back to Peng Ying.
<br><br>"What about her?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's expression sank as her gaze tightened on Peng Ying and walked towards her.
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's aura where Peng Ying could withstand, only felt a boulder pressed on her chest, her face was white as she backed up.
<br><br>"Name."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue coldly said.
<br><br>"Report ...... report to Lord Luo Lan, disciple Peng Ying." Peng Ying at this moment speak tongue tied, there have seen Luo Lan Xue this kind of aura, hastily salute.
<br><br>"In front of me, you a small disciple, why not kneel?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue glanced at Peng Ying and said coldly.
<br><br>Peng Ying a trembling, do not dare to question the direct kneeling, lowering his head cold sweat, heart is even more uneasy to the extreme.
<br><br>"Report the other information."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue pretty face raised high, and coldly said.
<br><br>"Disciple outer door Xuan Hall Peng Ying, under the management of the outer door Fang elders, just joined the Castle Peak Gate a month." Peng Ying did not dare to have the slightest concealment to say.
<br><br>At these words, Luo Lanxue's icy cold eyes moved slightly and shouted, "Palm."
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Peng Ying was startled.
<br><br>Luo Lanxue did not care about her, directly grabbed her arm, a wave of energy poured into it, and then her face was covered with frost.
<br><br>"The qualification is simply not enough to join my Castle Peak Sect, who in the end is so bold as to let you join the Castle Peak Sect without permission?" Luo Lanxue asked with an icy cold voice.
<br><br>Peng Ying's body trembled and he was scared out of his wits.
<br><br>"Starting from today, you have been expelled from the Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's face flashed with no doubt, her words didn't, like a judgment! Like a lightning strike directly into Peng Ying's mind.
<br><br>Peng Ying looked steeply white and became bloodless.
<br><br>In the heart, full of reluctance.
<br><br>She had given countless hours to join the Castle Peak Sect, and now she was expelled with a single word, so how could she be willing? Is it just because of that mortal, that Yi Feng?"
<br><br>"Pah!"
<br><br>Hearing Peng Ying address Mr. so impolitely, Luo Lan Xue's palm moved and a thick Qi energy was directly drawn on Peng Ying's face.
<br><br>"You are warned, don't ask what you shouldn't ask, and if you are not qualified to know something, you better have a sense of reverence."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue gave her an icy glance, and with a wave of her jade hand, the token hanging around Peng Ying's waist directly turned into smithereens, and from this moment on, she was no longer a disciple of the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>"Not qualified enough ......?"
<br><br>Looking at Luo Lanxue's departing back, Peng Ying, who was sitting paralyzed on the ground, held her swollen face, trembling, her face full of resignation, her mouth murmuring her voice, "No no, I must find out what the hell is going on ......"
