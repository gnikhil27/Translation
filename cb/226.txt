Makufu Mountain Range.
<br><br>Today's place, people simply do not dare to go in.
<br><br>Because just outside the mountain range, you can often hear the riot of demon beasts inside as well as hissing sounds.
<br><br>Most people don't know what's going on inside.
<br><br>Of course, there are a small number of people who know that there has been a big change inside and it has become a human purgatory.
<br><br>The corpses of humans and demonic beasts were everywhere in the various weeds, mountain streams, and ravines, and the smell of blood permeated the entire mountain range.
<br><br>Good thing, a rain down, so that this unpleasant smell dissipated a lot.
<br><br>But the atmosphere.
<br><br>But the more seemingly cold.
<br><br>A canyon in the middle.
<br><br>The human cultivators stationed here, looking at their clothing can be distinguished, is the South Sand Royal Sword Sect and the Li family people. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But the morale of these imperial sword sect disciples are very low, wearing wretched gray head and face at the same time, many people are wounded.
<br><br>And the top brass of the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li family are also here.
<br><br>In addition to the two sects as a high-end battle force of more than a dozen martial dwellers, Li Renhao, Li Jiaxin, Xu Mozhu and others, there is also the Imperial Sword Sect Patriarch Yang Tianyu, and the Li family's head Li Shuhua.
<br><br>Yang Tianyu was tall, with a pair of sword eyebrows, carrying his own might.
<br><br>Li Shuhua's appearance is elegant, with a scholarly temperament.
<br><br>But at this moment, they all without exception had a sad face, full of gloom.
<br><br>"It's all my fault, it's all my fault for having eyes, it's all my fault for being impulsive!"
<br><br>Under this atmosphere, Li Renhao had long been suffering from inner torture, choking her voice and shedding tears of remorse.
<br><br>She never thought that an unintentionally lost incense bag at that time would actually cause such consequences.
<br><br>During this period of time, the Royal Sword Sect and the Li Family had been engaged in a continuous battle with the demonic beasts of the Makufu Mountain Range for many days because of the search for that fragrant capsule.
<br><br>Although also caused heavy damage to the demonic beasts, but the Li family and the imperial sword clan came to the mountain disciples, but also lost half.
<br><br>And which is also change many increase.
<br><br>Originally they have also recovered the incense bag, and through the crowd after rigorous identification found that the incense bag is simply more than just a holy product so simple.
<br><br>Rather, it reached the emperor grade, or even a more advanced existence.
<br><br>The excited Li family and the Royal Sword Sect almost didn't smoke with excitement, but when they were about to return home, another big change happened.
<br><br>The unearthly great demon of Nansha, Song Ke, suddenly attacked them, not only costing the two sects a lot of money, but also taking away the incense bag.
<br><br>In a fit of anger, the two sects, including the Li family head and the Royal Sword Sect patriarch, personally rushed here with the intention of retrieving the incense pouch.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This was an emperor grade, or even a higher grade existence.
<br><br>With it, the two sects might be able to jump out of Nansha and lead their sects to a higher stage.
<br><br>So the next time, for the incense bag two doors and Song Ke led the many demonic beasts, launched a series of battles, will be the event more and more intense.
<br><br>But still underestimated Song Ke.
<br><br>I thought it was just a demon, but did not expect his realm has already reached the half-saint.
<br><br>Even though the two sects had more than ten Demon Saints, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu were even late Martial Saints, but they were still no match for Song Ke.
<br><br>After hitting them hard once again, they rushed to this canyon.
<br><br>And its surroundings, has long been surrounded by endless demonic beasts.
<br><br>This severe degree was already beyond the imagination of the crowd.
<br><br>"Now is not the time to regret, the most critical thing is to take a solution as soon as possible!" Yang Tianyu said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"How about asking other clans to help?" Li Jiaxin asked.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>At this time, a white-haired young man holding a sword next to him came out with a voice, "This fragrance capsule is of great importance, if other sects get involved, they will definitely get a piece of the pie!"
<br><br>His identity is also not simple.
<br><br>Li Chenghao, Li Renhao's brother, is not only the young master of the Li family, but also the first genius of the Royal Sword Sect.
<br><br>Martial Sect realm, considered a true pride of the sky.
<br><br>"Cheng Hao is right, we have already put so much effort into this fragrance bag, if we ask other forces to come in and mix it up, we still don't know who will end up with the fragrance bag." Li Shuhua, the head of the Li family, said approvingly.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads in agreement.
<br><br>But other than that, but can't get any other attention.
<br><br>Even retreat is not without thought.
<br><br>But retreat is the worst plan, once retreat, it is equivalent to the Li family and the Royal Sword Sect's efforts during this period of time wasted.
<br><br>"But I'm puzzled, why that Song Ke drove us to this point, but delayed to make a move on us?" At this point, Xu Mozhu stared and asked, "If we had laid an ambush nearby and sat back and waited for them to come to our door to fight, the chances of winning would have been much better!"
<br><br>No one could answer Xu Mozhu.
<br><br>Because they were also equally puzzled, they could only guess that Song Ke was not completely sure either.
<br><br>"Li Family Master, Patriarch, all the lords, it's not good."
<br><br>Just then, a disciple of the Imperial Sword Sect hurriedly came and reported.
<br><br>"What's going on?" Yang Tianyu asked.
<br><br>"Just now, the patrol of the clan had a small-scale battle with demonic beasts at the periphery, and forced out from the mouth of a demon king that Song Ke is breaking the saint!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>As soon as this disciple's words fell, the faces of the entire crowd changed drastically.
<br><br>This big change almost made them unable to accept it.
<br><br>Once Song Ke broke the Saint, then they had no chance of victory to speak of.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu asked with a disheveled face, "Retreat?"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"I'm afraid we'll have to do that."
<br><br>After a long silence, the crowd sighed in loss, their faces full of reluctance.
<br><br>But what could they do at the moment, after breaking the Saint, Song Ke was simply not the same level of existence as them anymore.
<br><br>If they were still obsessed, I'm afraid that the entire Li family and the Royal Sword Sect would have to be buried here.
<br><br>"Withdraw!"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu and Li Shuhua looked at each other and made a decision with their hearts dripping blood.
<br><br>After the decision was made, a large number of disciples assembled and began to retreat in an orderly manner towards the outside.
<br><br>"Rumble rumble rumble ......"
<br><br>However, the disciples of the two sects just had a movement, the earth suddenly came deafening figure, like an earthquake.
<br><br>Subsequently, under the gaze of the people's eyes smacking their lips, a huge human head, organized by countless tree trunks, stopped in front of the people.
<br><br>Also at the same time, the mountain forest countless powerful aura came, more than ten aura powerful demon ancestors appeared.
<br><br>"Greetings to Ancestor Sen!"
<br><br>The demon dignitaries knelt down collectively to worship that big face.
<br><br>"Song Ke!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Shuhua and the others' faces sank, and their hearts sank to the bottom.
<br><br>"What's going on, didn't they say that Song Ke was in the middle of a breakthrough?" Li Jiaxin asked gruffly.
<br><br>"This shouldn't be his original body."
<br><br>Yang Tianyu gruffly said, "This Song Ke old demon as a tree spirit who has cultivated for more than 100,000 years, cultivation has long been terrifying as such, all the trees in the forest can be transformed into his trunk, this Song Ke in front of us, I'm afraid that it is the doppelganger condensed by his slight distraction under the breakthrough."
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>But the face is still gloomy.
<br><br>Because this Song Ke old demon is too terrifying, just a doppelganger, let them feel powerless, I'm afraid that only Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu two join forces, can be able to fight against it.
<br><br>"Song Ke, that incense bag is yours, we won't rob it, we'll withdraw from the Makuhari Mountain Range."
<br><br>Since they had planned to retreat, Yang Tianyu and the others did not have much intention to fight, Yang Tianyu stepped out and said.
<br><br>And his attitude was clearly a bowed head.
<br><br>"Quit?"
<br><br>"Come to the mountain range to kill so many of my children, want to retreat and just want to withdraw?"
<br><br>That big face showed contempt, and an odd sound like a flood bell came out.
<br><br>"Song Ke, it is obvious that you demonic beasts attacked us first, and it is not your original body now, do you think you can still stop us if we want to leave?" Li Shuhua said in a cold voice.
<br><br>"Then, you guys just try!"
<br><br>The big face said disdainfully.
