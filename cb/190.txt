And as the black shadow slipped by, the ladies of the Yee Hong Court were suddenly agitated.
<br><br>Pointing, they started shouting.
<br><br>"That's him that's him."
<br><br>"Yes, it's him, hurry up and catch him."
<br><br>"Bones Ben Wei don't run."
<br><br>But the black-robed man, like a loach, rushed through the heavy blockage, a slip of smoke rushed to the street.
<br><br>And Yi Feng at this moment also confused.
<br><br>After reacting, he was furious.
<br><br>Feeling this skeleton Ben Wei is this broken skull?
<br><br>I thought this broken skull recently let him save his mind, did not expect to save and save to give him such a big trouble?
<br><br>"Dog thing, give me death." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Under the fury, Yi Feng took off the shoes in his hands and threw them towards the broken skull.
<br><br>That black-robed man a bouncing leg jump, instantly has run out of shadow.
<br><br>And can not chase the skeleton Ben Wei, chasing debts can not they had to turn back to find Yi Feng to ask for money.
<br><br>Looking at the woman who does not give money to pick up your skin, Yi Feng clenched his teeth before reluctantly taking out the money jar.
<br><br>A big half.
<br><br>No.
<br><br>Heart and liver pain.
<br><br>This moment, Yi Feng in the heart directly to that skeleton sentenced to death.
<br><br>After sending away the group of Yi Hong Yuan women, Yi Feng limped towards the inner room with a single shoe, weighing a lot lighter money jar, is more and more angry, more and more angry.
<br><br>Fuck.
<br><br>He usually save a lot, to make a wine also have to compare three, but by this dog thing to spend a day to drink a large part of the down.
<br><br>Under extreme anger, had to vent to the air.
<br><br>A foot, kicked out.
<br><br>The other shoe on that foot also took off the foot and out.
<br><br>Phew.
<br><br>What a coincidence, flew to the gap under the stone slab.
<br><br>The crevice.
<br><br>There was a centipede lying on its back, and was directly frightened by the sudden shoe that broke both legs.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"Hoo-ha!"
<br><br>"Hoo-ha!"
<br><br>"Heart, heart, my little heart, hoohah hoohah ......"
<br><br>The centipede patted his chest with his foot claws, his mouth shivered ha, and smoothed his breath for a long time before he was able to slow down.
<br><br>Then.
<br><br>Is full of crying.
<br><br>This fucking day, in the end what is the end ah!
<br><br>The heart wails while looking at his few legs, his face is full of death.
<br><br>After escaping from that spatial ring, he thought he had escaped, but did not expect to come to such a horrible place.
<br><br>The aura comparable to the demon sect's demon dweller appears from time to time is just, when they finally leave can run away, but found that this place everywhere emits a horrible fluctuation.
<br><br>A total of just a few feet away, it was enough to scare off eight legs.
<br><br>Seeing no hope of getting out, he had to return to the slab crevice, relying on a meticulous, in order to maintain the life of this way to live.
<br><br>But his grandmother, it is not a matter of going on like this!
<br><br>Forget it.
<br><br>Continue to meticulous it.
<br><br>As long as you do not die, there is always hope in life.
<br><br>And at this time.
<br><br>The sky appeared a red haze, shining half of the sky, and the red haze, seems to appear a phantom, this kind of heaven and earth phenomenon, stirred everyone.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>In the wasteland, Wu Yonghong lifted his head.
<br><br>"Either there is a high person's cave breaking ground, or there is a supreme treasure born." Chu Mad Lion said heartily.
<br><br>"Then what do we do?" Sun Zhuge asked.
<br><br>At these words, both of them looked at Wu Yonghong.
<br><br>Slightly pondering, Wu Yonghong said, "If it was before, we would naturally have to go and join in the fun, but now that we are with Mister, there is no longer that need."
<br><br>"But, the benefits are not afraid of more ah."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The two Chu Mad Lions were still undeterred and said with hopeful faces.
<br><br>"Ugh." Wu Yonghong shook his head and said, "At this point, that dung-bearing one is smarter than you all."
<br><br>Hearing this, the two Chu Mad Lion looked and found that Lu Dasheng was still honestly carrying dung, as if ignoring the vision in the sky.
<br><br>"People are able to think that following Mr. is better than fighting for any cave, how come you two don't know it?" Wu Yonghong said with quite a lesson.
<br><br>At these words, the two only suddenly returned to their senses.
<br><br>Showing a look of shame.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>What kind of treasure can be as good as following in front of the gentleman?
<br><br>"Then let them fight it out haha."
<br><br>"Yes, haha, we don't need it anymore."
<br><br>Chu Mad Lion and Sun Zhuge glanced at each other and laughed cheerfully, rather proudly.
<br><br>The heaven and earth vision lasted for three days.
<br><br>Green Mountain Sect.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan sat at the top, frowning tightly, listening to Zhu Yun's report.
<br><br>"Enlightened senior uncle, the matter has been confirmed, it should be a cave left behind by a Martial Saint named Jiang Yu in Pingjiang City ten thousand years ago, the matter has caused a sensation throughout Nansha, countless forces in Nansha have rushed over."
<br><br>"Known to come over are, the young master of the blowing snow mountain villa fifth long air, wind cloud valley saint daughter Yun Xian Que, of course, there is also the latest genius female disciple Peng Xian'er accepted by the heavenly sword door."
<br><br>"In addition to this, there are countless other experts who cannot be named."
<br><br>"And Feng Yun Valley saint daughter Yun Xian Que sent a letter to my Castle Peak Sect a day ago, because my Castle Peak Sect, as a local sect, has a lot of convenience to act, so they want my Castle Peak Sect to cooperate fully with his Feng Yun Valley, and after taking the cave, they can give our Castle Peak Sect 20% benefits."
<br><br>"Please decide, old ancestor."
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak was silent for a long time, and only after a long time took a deep breath and got up: "This matter is not trivial, it will make Pingjiang City into a maelstrom, under the y confusion of the Tomb of the Martial Saint, a carelessness can be exterminated!
<br><br>"So this matter, I need to go to ask the gentleman before making a decision!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Hearing that it was that person, Zhu Yun did not have any opinion and hastily agreed.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, Old Ancestor Qingshan had arrived at the martial school.
<br><br>"Sir, I've brought you some good wine this time." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said with a smile.
<br><br>"Oh?" Yi Feng took it and smelled it, and said with a smile, "The wine is not bad, or you, the old man, are thinking of me!"
<br><br>Saying that, the two began to have a casual conversation.
<br><br>"The Pingjiang City is not peaceful recently!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the street that was much more lively than usual, slightly sighed, and then looked at the old ancestor of Castle Peak and said, "The heaven and earth vision heard that it was a cave of some kind, what do you think?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's heart was slightly startled.
<br><br>Secretly surprised that Mr. really already know I came to the intention, can not help but speak respectfully said: "Mr. joking, I can how to see, I would rather know Mr. on this matter how to see?"
<br><br>"This kind of cave to see the hustle and bustle, as a fun chat is good." Yi Feng shook his head and laughed.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan nodded secretly.
<br><br>As expected, this kind of cave Mr. simply do not see, that is, as a look at a lively.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng can ignore, but he may not be able to, after all, he can still have a sect below, slightly hesitant, he opened his mouth and asked: "In fact, I'm not hiding from you, I want to go over and take a look, what do you think, sir?"
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>Seeing this, Old Ancestor Qingshan's heart thumped and he asked, "What does this mean, sir?"
