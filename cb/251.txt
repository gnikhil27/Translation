"That's right, it's what you think." The dog gave her a look and said indifferently, "Because tomorrow might be the emperor."
<br><br>Li Yihan's heart thumped, and almost didn't stand still to trip on the ground.
<br><br>"By the way, don't call me senior, and don't talk to me." At this point, the dog reminded again, "Because you have to remember that we are a group of mortals, and I, just a dog."
<br><br>And with that said!
<br><br>The dog took the lead and went back to the camp.
<br><br>Li Yihan stood alone in the same place in the wind.
<br><br>A group of mortals.
<br><br>A dog ......
<br><br>Really huh.
<br><br>......
<br><br>After the firewood and a series of things are done, Yi Feng burned up the fire and directly boiled the snake soup. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Add some more herbs."
<br><br>In this aspect of eating, especially boiling this kind of soup, Yi Feng never forgets to integrate his medicine skills that are comparable to God.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>This skill is frankly a healing skill, and the healing skill contains pharmaceuticals, in addition to acupuncture, ah, orthopedic ah, miscellaneous a whole lot, anyway, are related to the healing of diseases and injuries.
<br><br>So this seems to be a healing skill, but in fact it is all encompassing.
<br><br>"Wonderful!"
<br><br>"I just don't know how much experience I can add to my cooking skills."
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the lid and fanned it, smelling the fragrance with a satisfied smile, and at the same time remembered some of the missions issued by the system.
<br><br>The previous mission of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting, his chess skill is not yet fully to match with God.
<br><br>And the next one of cooking, wine, tea, sculpting and what not, it is even worse by far, none of them to the point of being comparable to God.
<br><br>"One step at a time, but there is a chance or first chess mastery before, after all, the qin, chess, calligraphy and painting on hanging so one, always feel uncomfortable."
<br><br>Yi Feng murmured softly.
<br><br>Soon after, the snake soup is already boiled.
<br><br>Everyone looked shiny, even Li Yihan gulped up saliva.
<br><br>However, pork rong and other people without Yi Feng's command only dare to look, she dared not have any action, and even sagely moved to the side, not dare to hope to drink this soup.
<br><br>"Freeze what, do not be polite, drink ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted, "Do you want me to feed you guys personally?"
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>The crowd took a bowl each and started to fight the soup.
<br><br>Looking at the soup with all kinds of spiritual qi bubbling in the bowl, and even all kinds of martial intent contained in it, the eyes of the crowd momentarily smoldered with brightness.
<br><br>"With this bowl down, we are afraid that we are going to break the saint."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong said quietly, and exchanged glances with Lu Dasheng, Sun Zhuge, and Chu Mad Lion.
<br><br>In fact, to say back, this bowl with the second life demon emperor as an ingredient, and with the addition of Yi Feng and God than the additive medicine, let them directly break the emperor is not impossible, only also due to the cultivation, they absorb only so much.
<br><br>But Pork Rong and the old king's head holding the bowl in his hand but did not dare to drink for a long time.
<br><br>They can also judge, dry this bowl of snake soup, I'm afraid that can be to the second life martial emperor.
<br><br>But the breakthrough of the second life martial emperor, will experience the heavenly tribulation ah!
<br><br>Heavenly tribulation this thing is not a joke, a careless soul will fly away, so other martial emperor tribulation, generally are to be prepared to do everything before the tribulation, and they are unprepared, can not be sure ......
<br><br>Moreover, the arrival of the heavenly calamity, I am afraid that it will also affect the initial intention of Mr. feeling ordinary life!
<br><br>"Sir, how about we, do not drink it?" Two people asked toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>But Yi Feng but white glance at the two of them, not good-naturedly said: "You two pretentious what strength, so a big pot, told you to drink you drink."
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the two people nodded their heads.
<br><br>Since the gentleman had said so, I guess there was no need for them to worry about it.
<br><br>After all, what they could think of, how could the gentleman not think of it?
<br><br>"Come doggie, you eat the snake gall."
<br><br>Yi Feng grabbed the snake gall bladder on the side and threw it over.
<br><br>Seeing this, the dog's eyes glowed gold, swept up high and swallowed the snake gall in one bite, then also shuttled two bowls of soup and hid in the carriage.
<br><br>Yi Feng himself also dried a few bowls of soup, but found Li Yihan sitting alone in the corner, and did not want to drink the soup.
<br><br>Yi Feng personally hit a bowl and brought it to her.
<br><br>"Miss Li, you have a bowl too!" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>Li Yi Han immediately revealed a flattered look, and quickly stood up, took a look at the snake soup, swallowed a mouthful of saliva, but said in his mouth, "Sir, this, I, how can I, how about you guys drink it?"
<br><br>This girl.
<br><br>It looked like she obviously wanted to drink it, but she was still embarrassed.
<br><br>And she seems to be a lot more polite to herself ah.
<br><br>It seems that men must also have skills to add ah, especially cooking, must be their own cooking skills, let this girl impressed it!
<br><br>Yi Feng forcefully pushed the snake soup over.
<br><br>Receiving the snake soup, Li Yihan held it with both hands, his body trembling.
<br><br>This is.
<br><br>A heaven-defying chance.
<br><br>What virtue is she capable of ah, did not think that this one not only ignore the past suspicion, but also give her such a blessing.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back, she bowed deeply.
<br><br>A small taste.
<br><br>She then felt the energy within her dantian stir, and almost instantly, the Martial King, who was still in the early stage, had instantly reached the critical point of breaking through to Martial Emperor.
<br><br>"Ah sir, let's go for convenience first."
<br><br>At this time, Wu Yonghong four people hurriedly said, and then ran towards the distant woods.
<br><br>"I, I will also go to the convenience."
<br><br>Li Yihan, holding the snake soup in his hand, also swept out immediately after.
<br><br>"What's going on here?"
<br><br>Looking at this group of people, Yi Feng is full of confusion, he also dried two bowls ah, why is nothing.
<br><br>The old man is an old man, still can not stand the supplement.
<br><br>Just Li Yihan a cultivator also like this, let people quite puzzled.
<br><br>"Big brother, big brother, get me a bowl, too."
<br><br>At this time, the skeleton Ben Wei sitting on the ground playing with stones in the sleeves of a centipede, said with a face full of urgency.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>"You're not afraid of dying?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei frowned.
<br><br>"Then, what about one drop too?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede said with a smile.
<br><br>"It's okay, you guys are too weak, it's necessary to give you a boost." Bone Ben Wei said, then picked up the bowl that Yi Feng had drunk from and fed the centipede a drop of residual spoon.
<br><br>"Wow!"
<br><br>"I'm going to fly, I'm going to peak in life brother, I also go to go to come."
<br><br>A drop down the mouth, the centipede immediately emitted an excited voice, and immediately ran out.
<br><br>Pork Rong and old man Wang looked at these people can be convenient, is really some envy, but they martial emperor breakthrough is not the same.
<br><br>Breakthrough will not have any might on their body, and the real might is on the heavenly tribulation, with their current preparation, there is really nothing to be sure to deal with the next heavenly tribulation.
<br><br>So they could only stay next to Yi Feng, hoping that Yi Feng could help them cope with the next heavenly tribulation.
<br><br>Only, they didn't know how Mr. would cope with it.
<br><br>And from the ancient times to the present, they had never heard that they could help others to pass the heavenly tribulation.
<br><br>Rumble!
<br><br>In the sky, the clouds turned and coalesced into two huge vortexes.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The two people's heavenly tribulation, is about to come.
<br><br>PS: Four more later, to make up for yesterday.
