Grand Master Wang walked into the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Hey sir, I've come to call you for dinner." Master Wang said with a smile, "But change the place, my place pot is not big enough, so temporarily decided to engage in your diagonal opposite Pork Wing."
<br><br>"Good no problem, you go over first, I'll clean up and come later." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Okay sir, I've got two pots of good wine waiting for you, start chopsticks when you come."
<br><br>Grand Master Wang smiled heatedly and left with his walking stick propped up.
<br><br>And at that moment.
<br><br>Across the hutong, two figures swept in at speed and landed on the ground.
<br><br>However, the two people seemed to be of extraordinary origin and dressed in luxury, but their appearance was incomplete.
<br><br>The man in his fifties had a miserable white face, as if he had a serious illness, coughing from time to time.
<br><br>And another seemingly celestial fairy veiled woman, the face under the veil is swollen, perhaps due to the swelling, making her nose become crooked, not to mention that the eyes have also become a small and large.
<br><br>The two are precisely the Peng Xian'er and long sword empty who chased Jiang Yu that day, but were knocked away by the black-robed man halfway. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>This punch, almost let two people directly did not slow down.
<br><br>The two people took most of the healing pills on their bodies and rested in place for several days before their injuries were suppressed.
<br><br>This caused them not to catch that day, that horrific scene!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They also knew from the Heavenly Sword Sect's news that Jiang Yu was exterminated by a hidden expert in the mortal world that day, and according to some other clues, they probably learned that Jiang Yu was exterminated near this square.
<br><br>"Listen to the scouts of the Heavenly Sword Sect to report that people from Wind and Cloud Valley, Devil's Voice Sect, and Blowing Snow Villa have all paid their respects to that supreme expert and seem to have received a lot of benefits." Yun Xian Que said with a frown.
<br><br>"Not bad, according to the news coming in that is the case."
<br><br>Long Jiankong nodded at the side and said, "But what's hateful is that they, the big sects, are intentionally blocking the news, even our scouts, can't inquire, which one that supreme master is exactly."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's icy cold eyes moved for a moment.
<br><br>"In fact, the most damned thing is that mysterious black-robed man that day, the strength is actually so powerful, if not halfway encounter him so an accident, that day we would have arrived at the scene, and how will let Yun Xian Que and the fifth long air and those few wastes of theirs shortcut first?"
<br><br>"Holy Maiden is right, but it's useless to talk about this now, we'd better find out who that one is as soon as possible!" Long Jiankong sighed, "We can't let other clans take the opportunity alone!"
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er nodded.
<br><br>After all, the Fifth Longkong, Yun Xianque and others had all won the chance at the hands of that one, and if he, the Heavenly Sword Sect, was the only one who didn't, how could she be willing to do that?
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Two people began to look for clues in the vicinity.
<br><br>The faint stench made Peng Xian'er notice something.
<br><br>Walked not far to the stinky ditch to take a look, and indeed there was a corpse lying inside.
<br><br>This corpse looks like it has been there for a few days, in this cold weather, despite the fact that it has been completely disfigured and covered with corpses, but the clothing on it is still recognizable.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Long Jiankong said in horror.
<br><br>"Good, it's Yu Wujie, that punk!"
<br><br>Looking at this corpse, Peng Xian'er's face was slightly complicated.
<br><br>"I thought I was wrong, I thought I would let go of my hatred and let him be a dog under me, but in the end I realized that he was not even qualified to be a dog, and now he deserves to end up like this!"
<br><br>Long Jiankong did not say anything.
<br><br>He knew more or less about the past of this newly promoted Saintess of the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>"However, the fact that his corpse is here means that we are not looking in the wrong place, the supreme master who killed Jiang Yu should be nearby." Peng Xian'er said.
<br><br>Saying that, she shifted her gaze, attempting to look for clues.
<br><br>But unintentionally, she saw the martial arts school not far away.
<br><br>No wonder this neighborhood always felt familiar, it turned out to be here.
<br><br>Her eyes could not help but reveal the color of hatred, the shame of that day at the shore of Pure Creek Lake, she could clearly remember it.
<br><br>At that very moment, a figure that she was familiar with came out of the martial arts school, and coincidentally, was walking towards her.
<br><br>Within a short while, the two collided head-on.
<br><br>"Stand still."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er mentioned her jade foot, stopping Lin Feng who was walking.
<br><br>"Something wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at the woman who stopped him, not recognizing this former childhood friend at all.
<br><br>"What, don't you recognize me?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er outlined a meaningful mouth, said leisurely: "Could it be that you don't remember my voice, do you recall well?"
<br><br>"Do not remember, so you who?"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and asked.
<br><br>Hearing this, Peng Xian'er's chest tightened and almost spurted out a mouthful of blood in anger.
<br><br>He had expected Yi Feng to be able to instantly recognize her and then kneel down to beg for mercy, but Yi Feng's reaction gave her the feeling of hitting her fist on cotton.
<br><br>"Peng Family Village, Peng Ying, you always remember!"
<br><br>Peng Ying's voice was icy cold, and did not intend to beat around the bush with Yi Feng, directly stating his identity.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>"It's you ah ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and said indifferently, "Look at your nose and face appearance should not mix well, you stop me is ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng's face changed slightly, and subconsciously took a step back.
<br><br>"You stop me ...... not to get back together with me, right?"
<br><br>PS: Later there is a chapter ha, and so I am busy after these two days, then resume the original update, sorry, another said the cartoon is in the making, when it comes out will be the first time to remind everyone.
