Jing Wufeng came all the way to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>He then also started with the martial arts schools, but all the martial arts schools he had visited had been slaughtered long ago.
<br><br>"It's Dustless Senior's tactics."
<br><br>"As long as we follow the martial arts halls one by one, we will be able to discover the traces of Senior Brother Wu-Chen."
<br><br>Jing Wufeng's pupils shrank slightly, and with a movement of his cloak behind him, his entire person turned into a wind and disappeared in the same place.
<br><br>Even if someone could detect his whereabouts, he could not see his real body, only a cloak swept by.
<br><br>Swift cloak.
<br><br>It is also one of the greatest treasures in the hands of Ning Xuanwu, can greatly increase the speed of human action and attack speed, seemingly harmless, but hidden murder.
<br><br>Relying on this Swift Cloak, Jing Wuchen, as a junior, had a place even in the entire South Sand Region.
<br><br>"Master, the people from the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce are here, inviting you to dinner."
<br><br>Zhong Qing said respectfully. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Good, tell him to wait at the door, you change your clothes and come with me." Yi Feng cleaned up a little and changed into a white robe, then he led Zhong Qing to the door.
<br><br>Outside the door, the steward of the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce had long prepared a sedan chair and was waiting for Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Good treatment!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was not polite, directly stepped on the sedan chair, and before he set off, beckoned towards Ao Qing at the door and shouted, "Wangcai, guard the house for me, especially if you encounter the kind of Xiao Xiao who throws stones, bite him to death for me."
<br><br>After the explanation, a group of people rushed directly toward the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>People have not yet arrived, Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, including Yin Xiong, a number of senior, are waiting here respectfully.
<br><br>In addition to that, of course, Luo Lanxue and Yin Luolie were also here.
<br><br>"President, I think it is necessary to adjust the share ratio for Mr. Yi."
<br><br>"Yes, I also think it is necessary, now is the Chamber of Commerce rating, Mr. Yi for our Chamber of Commerce is timely rain, profits first not to mention, just bring the impact and reputation can make our Chamber of Commerce greatly increase points ah!"
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>At the top, Yin Xiong took a sip of tea and said, "Last time, the housekeeper also came back to report to me that Mr. Yi did not seem too reluctant about the 100,000 gold coins share, so I also have the intention to give Mr. Yi an increase in the share."
<br><br>"Good, then I propose." A senior said, "In addition to the cost, our chamber will only take 10%, and the rest of the share will be given to Mr. Yi."
<br><br>"Yes, I agree with this move, this wave seems to be a profit concession, but our chamber gains reputation, after all, the rating is not solely based on profit, but more on reputation and influence." Another senior said.
<br><br>As the two spoke, others echoed the sentiment, basically in much the same way.
<br><br>Yin Xiong looked at Yin Luo Li and Luo Lan Xue on the side.
<br><br>He seemed to be sitting on the whole situation, but he knew in his heart that he had no decision power at all in this matter.
<br><br>He had already learned from Yin Luo Li and Luo Lan Xue's words that this Mr. Yi was not an ordinary person at all. Most likely, is hidden in the earth as a mortal supreme person.
<br><br>This kind of high person's mind, he a mortal where he can speculate, can only seek Yin Luo Li and Luo Lan Xue two opinions, so this is also the reason he invited the two women to come.
<br><br>The two nodded their heads and had no opinion.
<br><br>"Good, it's decided."
<br><br>Seeing that the two women had no opinion, Yin Xiong then directly shot the board.
<br><br>And outside the door, Yi Feng had already arrived.
<br><br>"Please come in, sir." The butler said respectfully.
<br><br>"You're welcome."
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted his robe and stepped off the palanquin, then took his young apprentice Zhong Qing towards the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, while the butler trotted ahead to report to the president.
<br><br>"This Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, it's really big!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked around with emotion, just this front hall, there were countless attendants, and an endless stream of customers purchasing items.
<br><br>On the side, Zhong Qing was also curiously surveying the surroundings.
<br><br>"Yi Feng?"
<br><br>Just at this moment, a voice came, drawing Yi Feng's attention.
<br><br>Looking at it with a tilted head, Yi Feng frowned slightly.
<br><br>Peng Ying.
<br><br>"Why are you in a place like this?"
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng again, Peng Ying's face was a bit complicated.
<br><br>"Why can't I be in a place like this?"
<br><br>Peng Ying's words were rather harsh, which straight away made Yi Feng feel a little funny.
<br><br>"I didn't mean anything else." Peng Ying explained, "I just ...... forget it, there doesn't seem to be anything to say between us anymore."
<br><br>"Ying'er, why is this trash again?" At this time, Yu Wujie, who was dressed in white, came clutching his sword, and once he saw Yi Feng, his face was gloomy, especially when he remembered that Peng Ying beside him must have been slept with by Yi Feng, he was straight up with killing intent, and questioned soberly, "Didn't you say that you have long since cleared the relationship with this punk?"
<br><br>"Brother Wu Jie, listen to my explanation." Peng Ying hurriedly held Yu Wujie's arm and explained in a panic, "I just happened to run into him here."
<br><br>"No need to explain, let me just kill him."
<br><br>Yu Wujie's face was cold, and the long sword in his hand was fiercely drawn out, and he swung it towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>And at that exact moment, the crowd led by Yin Xiong hurried out to meet Yi Feng, just in time to see this scene.
