A small remote mountain village.
<br><br>"Cluck Cluck ......"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin held golden rice grains in his hand and fed the baby chicks in the chicken pen.
<br><br>On the side.
<br><br>Mo Tianji was sitting upright on a stool, doing his math homework.
<br><br>"Senior brother, how come I haven't seen Huang Tian in the past few days?" After finishing the olympic math problem in his hand, Mo Tianji felt that his comprehension had improved again, and after putting away his homework, he couldn't help but ask towards Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>"Oh, Shen Nong brother recently in the research of genetic modification, the yellow sky borrowed as cattle to plow the land." Jia Jia Qin laughed softly.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Mo Tianji nodded and lamented, "After being away for so long, I don't know how the other senior brothers are doing."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>After feeding the chickens, Jia Jia Qin also sighed with emotion and said, "Why don't you pass on a message, senior sister, and ask how everyone is doing!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Mo Tianji nodded, and she wrote out dozens of letters and waved them out.
<br><br>The letters turned into a stream of light and disappeared.
<br><br>Within a glorious pavilion, a young man dressed in a dragon robe looked at the epistles sent by Mo Tianji, his eyes filled with tears.
<br><br>"I really miss the days of opening books at my master's place."
<br><br>"I also miss all my brothers in the division."
<br><br>"Although I am already the king of the Tianlong Empire, I think there is still a big gap between me and my senior brothers."
<br><br>"But there are division brothers who are not far away, be sure to come and play with me!"
<br><br>Thinking of this, the dragon robed youth also wrote out dozens of letters and threw them into the sky.
<br><br>"So, it's the letters from senior sister Mo Tianji and senior brother Long."
<br><br>On the top of a high mountain, inside a huge sect filled with thick clouds, a youth stood with his hands in the air, reading the letters.
<br><br>"It's really good, Senior Brother Long is already a king, I will definitely come to play with you when I have the chance."
<br><br>"Senior sister Mo Tianji seems to have made great achievements in mathematics, senior brother Qin of the Jia family has researched new species again, and senior brother Shen Nong seems to have researched genetic modification."
<br><br>"Worthy of all the disciples of the master, fortunately I am now also the patriarch of the Mist Sect, not too much shame."
<br><br>Just finished reading, there were several more letters came.
<br><br>He opened them one by one.
<br><br>"Wow, has senior sister Su Yunyun gone to the immortal world, it's quite good."
<br><br>"Senior Brother Hong Crazy seems to have died with some clan again recently."
<br><br>"Qi Yu senior brother seems to be a bit miserable, still can't fly, fought with someone a stomp and jumped to the moon, can't come back, or Xiao Zhan senior brother ran to the moon to pick him up."
<br><br>Speaking of this, the disciple could not help but sigh, eyes filled with a strong nostalgia.
<br><br>And after a few more days, all the disciples received a letter from Li Tai Bai.
<br><br>Li Tai Bai's epistle said that he rode a green ox backwards to travel around the world and met a later-admitted senior disciple.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"Did the master take in another newcomer?"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin finished feeding the old sow and ran towards Mo Tianji and asked, "What is this senior brother's name and how does he look like?"
<br><br>"According to senior brother Tai Bai's letter, this senior brother is called Wu Tian, the very same Wu Tian who has been in the limelight recently and attacked the Cloud Top Empire." Mo Tianji explained.
<br><br>"OhË±Å?"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin's eyes lit up and he exclaimed, "I said how a small country dares to fight the Genting Empire, it turns out to be my senior brother, really worthy of the master, none of the disciples he took in are straw."
<br><br>"Alas, despite this, we have not been able to satisfy the master ah, Tai Bai senior brother also said in his letters, Wu Tian senior brother cried and told him that the master was not very satisfied with him yet, and criticized him for not having a pattern." Mo Tianji said.
<br><br>"Alas, you hurry back to a letter, let Taibai senior brother more comfort comfort Wu Tian senior brother, the master usually does not also scold us waste, and not just criticize him alone."
<br><br>"This is all because the master expects his son to become a dragon, hope that we have a better build ah!"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin sighed softly.
<br><br>"I'll write back this time."
<br><br>Mo Tianji nodded, and then a letter was sent back towards Li Tai Bai.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>Shen Nong, who was farming, rushed back and hurriedly shouted, "Senior brother, something happened to senior sister, at noon, I bolted Huang Tian to the river to eat grass, and when I came back, I found that Huang Tian had been killed."
<br><br>Hearing this.
<br><br>Mo Tianji and Jia Jia Qin's face changed slightly.
<br><br>Followed by Shen Nong rushed toward the river.
<br><br>And in the cave next to them, more than three thousand little yellow skies also hurriedly followed out.
<br><br>When they came to the river, they really found the traces of the super battle.
<br><br>At the same time, they also found traces of the domain nearby.
<br><br>"It seems that these people came prepared for the Yellow Sky, and used the domain blockade, no wonder we didn't find the fluctuation of the battle." Mo Tianji observed the surroundings and said with a frown.
<br><br>"Senior brother is really sorry, it's all because I didn't watch Huang Tian." Shen Nong said with a face full of guilt.
<br><br>And on the side, more than three thousand little yellow skies also came out chattering sounds.
<br><br>"Master master, must help us find out the murderer who killed dad!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we want to take revenge for daddy."
<br><br>"Oooooo, daddy is actually dead, must kill the thief!"
<br><br>"You guys don't have to worry." Jia Jia Qin hurriedly reassured, "Your father can't die, I will immediately notify Master Huatuo to come over and take a trip."
<br><br>After saying that, Jia Jia Qin also gave Shen Nong a comforting glance, and then a message was typed out.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>A young man with a long beard and carrying a medicine box stepped into the air and came.
<br><br>After telling the matter roughly, Huatuo opened the medicine box and started the rescue treatment for Huang Tian.
<br><br>After a day of hasty treatment, Hua Tuo wiped a sweat, Huang Tian was finally back from the dead.
<br><br>"Senior brother is really great!" Jia Jia Qin and the others said in admiration.
<br><br>"Senior brother and the others have laughed, this is all because of the good teachings of the master." Hue Tuo said with a smile, "Also it's because of Huang Tian's physique, being an ancient vicious beast, which gave me some chances."
<br><br>"Senior brother is really modest, today so hard, from me to mention two phoenix back to stew to make up for it!" Jia Jia Qin said.
<br><br>"Aiya, where do you need to be so polite, phoenix is not necessary, but if you have to get it, get two Xuanwu for me, it just so happens that I am short of two Xuanwu shells as a medicinal primer for refining medicine." Hetao said with a smile.
<br><br>"Good, when senior brother goes back, I will get the Xuanwu to you." Jia Jia Qin laughed and said.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the several masters who were able to bring me back to life!"
<br><br>And aside, the slightly recovered Huang Tian knelt on the ground, and a grateful voice came out.
<br><br>And seeing Huang Tian awaken, more than three thousand little yellow skies pounced towards him.
<br><br>Looking at more than three thousand little yellow sky, Huang Tian revealed a smile of relief, but remembering the previous fierce danger, he almost never saw the little guys again, his eyes flickered with a strong gloomy hostility.
<br><br>"Children, remember, the ones who did it to me are the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch and the Exterminator of the Cloud Top Empire."
<br><br>"They almost made us heaven and earth separated forever, this revenge we need to keep in our hearts, and the Cloud Top Empire will not stop until we die!"
<br><br>"Ow ow ow!"
<br><br>"Genting Empire."
<br><br>"Immortal."
<br><br>"Father, don't worry, in the future we will definitely step on the Genting Empire!"
<br><br>"We will definitely rip off the heads of the Exterminator and the Genting king."
<br><br>At once, more than three thousand little yellow skies puffed up their cheeks and raised their little fists, emitting a firm voice.
<br><br>I am afraid that the World Exterminator and the Genting Kingdom Monarch could never imagine.
<br><br>Huang Tian did not kill, but also at once let more than 3,000 little yellow heavens with unlimited achievements, not to die against them.
<br><br>They were still sitting beside the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, waiting with anticipation for their Qi luck to return.
<br><br>But a crunch.
<br><br>The Qi Luck Immortal Pillar once again dropped significantly, with only a drop left.
<br><br>This cold snap, let the extinction and the cloud top king stare at the eyes, was struck by the mind explosion, directly jerked down on the ground spitting up white foam.
