Liu Yan clutched the Heavenly Spirit Tantra and gave Guo Shijie a fierce glare.
<br><br>Then he left indignantly.
<br><br>Guo Shijie also walked out of the main hall and looked at Liu Yan's departing back viciously with his crossed waist.
<br><br>"Just wait, I will always make you regret it!" Guo Shijie gritted his teeth and muttered.
<br><br>Seeing this, Guo Shijie's subordinates behind him also followed and viciously echoed, "That's right, and dare to sue, the peak master will definitely make her look good!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie tilted his head and turned his head in confusion, looking at his subordinates.
<br><br>A complaint?
<br><br>"What the hell is this? This is clearly slander! It's slander!!! It's slander!!!"
<br><br>It's a slander!!!" "It's a smear on my head!!!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes ......" the subordinates hurriedly responded.
<br><br>Guo Shijie pressed the fire and turned back to continue to look at Liu Yan who was walking away. In his heart, he kept cursing his mother. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Seeing Guo Shijie calmed down, the subordinate behind him really couldn't hold back.
<br><br>"Peak master, really not we did it?"
<br><br>Besides us, who else could it be?
<br><br>"I'll fuck you!" Guo Shijie turned his head and kicked over!
<br><br>A long arc appeared in mid-air, and the figure flashed past.
<br><br>Guo Shijie was so angry that he blew his beard and stared.
<br><br>So angry ......
<br><br>Others suspect even if, damn even his own people are suspicious.
<br><br>He turned his head suddenly and looked at the other disciples beside him, "You guys don't think I did it too, do you?"
<br><br>The group of disciples all lowered their heads sheepishly.
<br><br>"Kam!" He spat, "What a bunch of fools, talking to you can make you die!!!"
<br><br>A bunch of disciples were silent.
<br><br>"Go keep an eye on the people of Sun and Moon Peak, once the outer secret realm is repaired bring me back the Heavenly Spirit Tantra immediately!" Guo Shijie ordered as he left with big steps.
<br><br>"Yes!" A blue-clothed disciple behind him answered and headed in the direction of the Star Peak.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Liu Yan took the Heavenly Spirit Tantra and hurriedly rushed to the outer sect secret realm.
<br><br>There wasn't much time left before the disciple trial meeting, so she had to hurry to get the secret realm aura back!
<br><br>The disciples could absorb a little bit more.
<br><br>When she arrived outside the outer secret realm, a group of elders gathered around anxiously.
<br><br>"What about the peak master, the patriarch punished Guo Shijie did not?" The eldest elder opened his mouth first and asked.
<br><br>Liu Yan shook his head with a sullen face.
<br><br>The third elder saw this and jumped to his feet and cursed, "The patriarch is obviously favoring that guy! What an outrage! How dare you not punish me for destroying my secret realm, there are no rules!"
<br><br>Liu Yan just sighed and took out what was in his hand.
<br><br>"Elders don't panic, Guo Shijie took out this for the secret realm aura repair."
<br><br>Seeing the Heavenly Spirit Tantalum, the elders were surprised, even the temperamental Third Elder had curbed a lot.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Tantra is a rare object, although it cannot create aura out of thin air, but if it can encounter the aura eye, this object can draw out a constant source of aura from the aura eye.
<br><br>This is also the reason why Sun and Moon Peak has always wanted to compete for the secret realm of the outer sect.
<br><br>Guo Shijie holds this heavenly spirit tantalum in his hand, so that the spiritual qi in the secret realm will never be depleted.
<br><br>At this time, the spiritual energy in the secret realm is gone, but the good thing is that the spring is still there.
<br><br>As long as there was the Heavenly Spirit Tantra as a trigger, the secret realm could be restored.
<br><br>"Guo Shijie was actually able to take out the Heavenly Spirit Tantra!" The Third Elder was incredulous, "There must be a conspiracy!"
<br><br>"Even if there is a conspiracy, it's impossible. Now we must hurry to restore the secret realm and let the disciples go in to cultivate." Liu Yan instructed.
<br><br>After saying that, he took the elders of Star Peak into the depleted secret realm.
<br><br>Liu Yan carefully placed the Heavenly Spirit Tantra on the spring.
<br><br>The crowd formed a formation and sat on all sides of the spiritual spring pool, hanging in the air and forming seals.
<br><br>The words were recited in their mouths.
<br><br>In the next moment, a golden light shot out from each person and connected to another person. Until all the golden light connected together and converged into a huge wave of energy.
<br><br>The energy was poured onto the Heavenly Spirit Tantra.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Tantra abruptly erupted into white mist and headed toward the spring.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>The crowd did not know that the mysterious spring had long dried up and no drops were left, and the heavenly spirit tantalum, even if it was strong, could not play any role.
<br><br>Instead, the extreme dryness caused a back-absorbing effect.
<br><br>"Bang" sound.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Tantalum suddenly exploded!
<br><br>The golden light on the elders in mid-air also suddenly broke and fell down one after another.
<br><br>More or less all of them were devastated.
<br><br>The crowd was greatly alarmed!
<br><br>"What's going on!" Some elders exclaimed, "How did the Heavenly Spirit Tan explode!"
<br><br>Liu Yan, who had fallen and sat on the ground, touched the blood at the corner of her mouth, she was the most important part of the party, and now she was also the most severely devastated by the backlash.
<br><br>Her face was gloomy as she stared deadly at Tian Ling Tan, "We've been tricked!"
<br><br>The third elder also breathed heavily, his face indignant, "Guo Shijie really has a plot! Not only did he destroy my outer sect's secret realm, but he also tried to design to kill our Star Peak elders!"
<br><br>In the midst of all the noise, a blue-clothed disciple standing not far away looked at that Heavenly Spirit Tantalum with a deadly look.
<br><br>His eyes were almost scared off!
<br><br>Someone from Star Peak had destroyed Heavenly Spirit Tan!
<br><br>No ......
<br><br>That disciple looked again at the Star Peak elders and Peak Master Liu Yan who were lying on the ground after being revolted.
<br><br>Listening to their indignant curses and reprimands.
<br><br>Terror was quickly replaced by surprise.
<br><br>Our peak master Guo is really a good plan! Two birds with one stone ah ......
<br><br>Not only did he destroy the outer secret realm, but he also made a plan to injure the elders and the peak master of Star Peak!
<br><br>He has to hurry back to tell the peak master the good news!
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Peak master peak master, good news! Great news in the sky!" The blue-clothed disciple rushed into the Sun Moon Peak's main hall.
<br><br>Guo Shijie smiled and his face lit up with joy.
<br><br>"What's wrong?" He got up and poked out his body slightly, with an expectant face.
<br><br>"The people from Star Peak destroyed the Heavenly Spirit Tantra!" The disciple exclaimed in surprise.
<br><br>Guo Shijie's face twisted, "What the hell?"
<br><br>"The Heavenly Spirit Tantra blew up." The disciple was still impulsively reporting back, "At the same time, all the elders and peak masters of Star Peak were all injured in the scheme!"
<br><br>"Wait, you said, what happened to the Heavenly Spirit Tantra?" Guo Shijie desperately tried to hold back his temper and asked with a trembling voice.
<br><br>"It blew up." The disciple truthfully returned, "Of course, I know, that one is definitely not the real Heavenly Spirit Tantalum!"
<br><br>"You know a you paralyze a ball ！！！！！" Guo Shijie roared, the sound of roar almost overturned the roof!
<br><br>The disciples were stunned in.
<br><br>The next moment, Guo Shijie had disappeared from the spot.
<br><br>In a flash, Guo Shijie stood within the secret territory of the outer sect. His eyes stared deadly at the Heavenly Spirit Tan that had turned into pieces in the Spirit Spring.
<br><br>The eyes could not stop cracking!
<br><br>The people of Star Peak saw Guo Shijie.
<br><br>The crowd that had just calmed down was immediately flooded with insults and heckling, as well as personal attacks.
<br><br>"Heh! You thousand-killing bastard still dares to come!" The third elder stood up trembling holding the stone, looking at Guo Shijie with a gaze that could not wait to eat him up!
<br><br>"Guo Shijie, you're really good at it!" Liu Yan glared at Guo Shijie with red eyes, "I didn't expect you to be sinister to this extent!"
<br><br>"I will definitely take revenge for this revenge on Star Peak!" The Grand Elder also had red eyes, "If I wasn't being revolted now, I would have taken your dog's life!"
<br><br>"Guo Shijie, you dare to injure my Star Peak elders and peak master privately, the sect master will definitely not spare you!" Said another elder next to him, spitting out a mouthful of blood in a fit of anger!
<br><br>Guo Shijie was clearly not revolted, but at this moment he was shaking.
<br><br>His eyes were deadly glued to the fragment of Heavenly Spirit Tantalum.
<br><br>It looked even more seriously injured than it had been reversed.
<br><br>"Damn it, you are finished." Guo Shijie shook his body, his gaze frozen as he muttered, "I'm telling you guys, you're finished."
<br><br>In the next instant, Guo Shijie's figure disappeared in place.
<br><br>Immediately afterwards, howls and cries resounded through the Sovereign Hall.
<br><br>"Sovereign, you have to do something for me!!! I was kind enough to lend them the Heavenly Spirit Tantalum, but they destroyed my Heavenly Spirit Tantalum!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie pounded his chest and howled so loudly that he was about to overturn the roof.
<br><br>Liu Yan and the elders of Star Peak, who had been summoned over by the patriarch, stood aside, all shouting reprimands and insults at Guo Shijie.
<br><br>The cries and scoldings were so intermingled that Patriarch Sima Zhen's scalp was hurting from listening to them.
<br><br>He rubbed his scalp and saw that the two houses were arguing like hell.
<br><br>"All shut up!" He chirped.
<br><br>The voices on both sides stopped, and Guo Shijie held back his howls.
<br><br>"In addition to Guo Shijie and Star Peak's people at the scene, didn't you say there was another one?" The patriarch raised his hand and pointed at the blue-clothed disciple.
<br><br>"You come and say, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Patriarch can't, he's a disciple of Sun Moon Peak, he definitely won't tell the truth!" The Star Peak elder tried to stop it.
<br><br>The patriarch swept over impatiently.
<br><br>That elder only had to silence.
<br><br>"Speak!" A majestic voice echoed in the hall.
<br><br>That blue-clothed disciple's legs went weak in fear and he knelt down with a poof.
<br><br>Then, extremely vainly, he looked at Guo Shijie.
<br><br>This one heartfelt look was captured by the entire grand hall.
<br><br>Patriarch Sikong Zhen was no exception.
<br><br>His face sank as he looked towards Guo Shijie.
<br><br>The next moment, Guo Shijie had stormed away and rushed directly to that disciple, "Look nigga old stinky than, what are you doing looking at me for nothing!!!"
<br><br>"Fucking old me get you to death ！！！！"
