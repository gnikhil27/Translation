Therefore, Zhu made light to hastily suppress the excitement in his heart and showed an immovable appearance.
<br><br>"Let's go, I'll take you back to the clan!"
<br><br>He puffed up his chest, stroked his beard, and said in an immortal manner.
<br><br>"Are we just going to walk back to the clan?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Then, what else?"
<br><br>Zhu made the light wrong.
<br><br>"Wouldn't it be better to fly back, I've seen other sect's disciples before, they were all taken back by the people of the sect." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"When, of course, as a disciple of my Qingniu clan, and other clans must have the same treatment."
<br><br>Zhu made the light proudly said, then grabbed Yi Feng's shoulder with one hand, fiercely glared at the ground before shaking and flying up into the sky. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng just followed Zhu make light and flew up into the sky, towards the Qingniu clan a hundred miles away.
<br><br>"Hey, Sovereign, why is it a little shaky?" In the sky, Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"The airflow is bumpy, normal, normal."
<br><br>Zhu made light explained awkwardly, imperceptibly wiped the cold sweat on the top of his head.
<br><br>"Oh, then how about we speed up a little, it's getting late." Yi Feng then said.
<br><br>"There is no need for this ...... right?"
<br><br>Zhu made the light face ugly and said.
<br><br>"This is indeed a bit slow, besides I want to hurry up and visit our clan." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>Zhu Chengguang was sweating coldly.
<br><br>He also wanted to fly faster, but his strength didn't allow it!
<br><br>You know, although the Martial Spirit realm is able to fly through the air, but he just broke through the Martial Spirit, plus the realm is not solid, he is a bit difficult to fly by himself, let alone carrying a Yi Feng in his hand.
<br><br>So he had to say so: "Actually, this patriarch is afraid that you can't stand the bumps, after all, the speed is very scary."
<br><br>"It's okay, I'm not afraid."
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a hurry.
<br><br>Zhu made the light mouth could not help but twitch.
<br><br>Black face clenched his teeth, legs in mid-air and fierce glare a few feet.
<br><br>Just like that, the speed of the two people moving forward was finally speeded up a bit.
<br><br>After an hour had passed, the two had flown more than fifty miles.
<br><br>But at this time, Yi Feng found something wrong, the two people are like a bird with broken wings, a moment from towards the ground planted, and then pulled up.
<br><br>Yi Feng wanted to ask what was going on, but Zhu made light but red neck half a word.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Finally, suddenly up and down the two, along with Yi Feng a shout, towards the forest inside planted.
<br><br>This time, scared Yi Feng enough.
<br><br>But what touched him was that at the moment of planting down, this little old man used his body to protect him tightly, not letting him get half hurt.
<br><br>"Patriarch, how are you, what the hell happened here, how can you fly and fall down?" Yi Feng hurriedly got up and looked at Zhu Make Guang, who was pressed under his body, and asked in a hurry.
<br><br>Zhu makes the light mouth spit white foam, red face swallowed, eyes rolled for a long time, only in a hurry, suddenly and profoundly said: "Shh, do not speak."
<br><br>Yi Feng's body was stunned, lowered his voice and asked, "Patriarch, what is going on."
<br><br>"Someone attacked me just now."
<br><br>Zhu made Guang said in a serious manner.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes glared, and he hurriedly looked his alert gaze around.
<br><br>"You can't see them, they use space, space attack I know, right?" Zhu made light said in a serious manner.
<br><br>Yi Feng was bewildered.
<br><br>"You do not know is not to blame you, in any case, this is a very advanced technique, able to kill between invisible, there are three experts of the same level use space to sneak attack on me, I fly with you while struggling with them."
<br><br>"But don't worry, although I fell down with you, but I also used the monstrous means to take out the three of them."
<br><br>Zhu made light lying on the ground gasping for air and said.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"Patriarch is really powerful, a high achiever!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but exclaim.
<br><br>"Keep a low profile, keep a low profile."
<br><br>Zhu made light pressed his palm and said, "But this matter is of great importance, you must not say anything."
<br><br>"Oh chicken 8K!"
<br><br>Yi Feng put up an Ok gesture.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Zhu made the light look at Yi Feng blankly.
<br><br>"Understand!"
<br><br>Yi Feng put away the gesture and added anew.
<br><br>"En, go rest next to me, this Sovereign will take a good rest and then take you on the road again." Zhu made light instructed.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly nodded his head and retreated to the side.
<br><br>Seeing this, Zhu makes the light a great sigh of relief, lying in place and breathing heavily.
<br><br>In his heart, he secretly thanked himself for his quick reaction and did not show himself in front of this kid.
<br><br>After resting for a long, long time, Zhu made light a pill that was about to become moldy and took Yi Feng back on the journey.
<br><br>After another hour, he finally made it back to the Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>"Look, this is my Qingniu Clan."
<br><br>Zhu made the light breathe heavily while introducing it towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>"It's spectacular."
<br><br>Yi Feng complimented heartily.
<br><br>To be honest, Yi Feng was really a bit disappointed with this Green Ox Clan.
<br><br>There were only two or three buildings of that size, and the only larger martial arts field in the middle had potholes.
<br><br>But Yi Feng did not care.
<br><br>Perhaps this clan is very low-key, after all, next to this seemingly bone-thin Zhu makes light but very powerful ah.
<br><br>Using space to fight three people with one, and in the state of flying with him, he killed three people back with his bare hands.
<br><br>"You're back, Master."
<br><br>Just then, a sweet-looking young girl with pigtails, came out with a voice.
<br><br>Her pretty face was smiling, her appearance was good but her character was cheerful, and seeing her seemed to make her mood a lot better.
<br><br>"Oh, it's Xiaomai, you're just in time, this is the junior brother who just entered the sect, you take him on a good tour of the sect, and take him to find a place to live." Zhu made light instructed.
<br><br>"Okay, Master."
<br><br>Xiaodai agreed readily, then walked up to Yi Feng, pawed her toes, and said with a smile, "My name is Yunmai, nice to meet you."
<br><br>"Senior Sister Yunmai, how are you, I am Yi Feng, please take care of me in the future." Yi Feng said with the same smile.
<br><br>After a simple exchange of pleasantries, Cloud Dancing led Yi Feng to spin around the Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>Within a courtyard.
<br><br>Wu Tao was sitting on his bed.
<br><br>And at his feet, half a room of talisman paper was placed, in addition to that, there was also a large pile inside the storage ring.
<br><br>"Some of the 100 million doppelgangers I put out have died, and I don't know if it was that person who did it to track me."
<br><br>"But whether or not that person moved, still need to be more cautious, so in sacrificing a billion split body out!"
<br><br>After saying that, he quickly cast hand seals.
<br><br>At once, the talisman paper at his feet quickly bloomed with light, disappearing one by one at a rapid speed.
<br><br>After a long, long time ......
<br><br>The Immortal River Continent had increased its population by one billion out of thin air!
