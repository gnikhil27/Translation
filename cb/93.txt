"Humph, what's the dare?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan was furious.
<br><br>Not to mention that today's Fried Heavenly Gang is inferior to his Castle Peak Sect, even if the Fried Heavenly Gang in its heyday dared to offend Mr., he would dare to touch it with a chopper.
<br><br>With an order from Lu Qingshan, the army of the Castle Peak Sect steeply marched off.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The three great martial spirit experts of the Explosive Heavenly Gang suddenly stared in awe, he had thought that Lu Qingshan had only released a word, but did not expect that it was really put into action.
<br><br>And after the Qingshan Sect's army started to pull out, Lu Qingshan gave another angry grunt.
<br><br>With his order, the eighteen guardians left behind to guard the three Martial Spirit experts surrounded the past.
<br><br>The eighteen guardians, but the mainstay of the Castle Peak Sect, cultivation has also reached the Martial Spirit realm, siege up three, almost without suspense.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>Three miserable screams fell, three martial spirits did not even bubble, was captured alive by the eighteen protectors. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Seeing this, Mao Lin father and son both trembled and sweated coldly.
<br><br>I never thought that their trusted three martial spirits are so unbeatable, although just watching them flee I knew they were no match, but you can at least resist it.
<br><br>For a while, the father and son's heart came to a burst of animal pain!
<br><br>After capturing the three great martial spirits alive, Lu Qingshan's majestic gaze fiercely looked towards Mao Lin father and son, accompanied by a dense pressure.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Under this mighty pressure, Mao Lin father and son both failed to hold on for a moment, and their knees directly landed heavily on the ground, their faces flushed with despair.
<br><br>"It was you, who sent someone to hurt Mr. Yi's disciple?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan questioned with a heavy voice, and while questioning, the pressure on his body grew stronger and stronger.
<br><br>"Not me not me." Under this pressure and fear, Mao Yi's heart defenses collapsed and he shouted hysterically, "I wasn't even involved in this matter ah, it was him, it was him ......"
<br><br>Saying that, he hurriedly pointed at Mao Lin, his mouth frantically shouted, "It's all this old thing that did this, it has nothing to do with me ah!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Seeing his son fall back on his own, Mao Lin's anger and blood attacked his heart, a mouthful of blood directly spurted out of his mouth, he did all of this for Mao Yi's future, but did not expect that Mao Yi instantly sold him out.
<br><br>However, the old ancestor of the green hill did not have the heart to watch them bite the dog, all he could think about was how to calm the anger of Mr. However, hearing Mao Yi say this, the old ancestor of the green hill will be cold eyes fell on Mao Lin.
<br><br>"So, the mastermind behind the scenes is you?"
<br><br>At these words, Mao Lin's face shriveled up and became bloodless, knowing that he would not be able to escape today, raising his unwilling eyes towards the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, and saying in a hoarse voice, "If my guess is correct, you are the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak Sect's Castle Peak, right?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan did not say anything, but his eyes were still cold.
<br><br>Mao Lin planted his head.
<br><br>Now he could not see that the Green Mountain Sect had come out to attack his small Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>He just couldn't figure out why, with a tiny Yi Feng alone, it would cause such a big reaction, and even make the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak personally come out and the whole mountain sect pour out?
<br><br>"What the hell is he ......?"
<br><br>Can't help, he gritted his teeth and asked the doubts in his heart.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan revealed a disdainful smile and said morosely, "Although with a waste like you are not qualified to know the identity of Mr., but I can also let you die."
<br><br>"He, not only is my Lu Qingshan and Qingshan Gate's life-saving benefactor, but also my Lu Qingshan most admired senior, and he concealed cultivation, broken mortal like dust came to this small city to travel the earth to feel life, but you a trash waste but almost brutalized his disciple ......"
<br><br>"You say you, should not die?"
<br><br>"You Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, should not be destroyed!"
<br><br>The moment the words of the old ancestor Qing Shan fell, it was like a thunderbolt rang out in Mao Lin's mind, his eyes widened, and his eyes flashed with thick disbelief.
<br><br>In his mind, the phrase conceal cultivation, into the mortal world to travel the earth has been lingering.
<br><br>So he is ......
<br><br>"Also, you are most unenlightened is, obviously Mr. gave you many opportunities, and even just need you to grasp, get him a little chance to let you surpass 10,000 people, but you, but you are blind!" The old ancestor of Qing Shan sneered nonchalantly, obviously, he had long felt the intelligence of Ping Jiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>With this remark, Old Ancestor Qing Shan directly hit the most painful place in Mao Lin's heart, and under the attack of anger, another mouthful of blood was spat out.
<br><br>Who said, not?
<br><br>Originally, he had the opportunity to take advantage of the first opportunity to reach cooperation with that one, to establish a good relationship.
<br><br>But he, however, single-handedly buried!
<br><br>Hate!
<br><br>Regret!
<br><br>"The matter has come to this, go to hell and open your eyes in the next life."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Mount Qing no longer has the patience to nag with Mao Lin, his palm gently cover down, huge qi collapse and pressure.
<br><br>Under this pressure, Mao Lin's body meridians broken, the internal organs suffered shattered, fell to the ground with eyes wide open.
<br><br>"Congratulations, my lord, handily killed the culprit!" On the side, Mao Yi shouted frantically, "So Lord, you can spare me now!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"You deserve to die even more!"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain coldly snorted and gave him a mocking glance, a palm went over, Mao Yi didn't even have a chance to beg for mercy, he was directly slapped into pieces!
<br><br>Without giving them another glance, his cold gaze turned his gloomy gaze towards the three Martial Spirits.
<br><br>"It's, your turn."
<br><br>The three Martial Spirits were permeated with fear, and their mouths threatened, "If you dare to touch us, the Explosive Sky Gang will not spare you."
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>The Green Mountain Ancestor's face sank as he directly crushed one of them to death.
<br><br>"You actually dare to kill us?" Seeing their companions killed, the other two shouted frantically, "Do you really think that my Heaven Frying Gang is only as simple as it seems, we guarantee that all of your Castle Peak Sect's corpses will be left without bones."
<br><br>"Noisy."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan launched two palms and directly cut off the lives of the two.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>However, just as Lu Qingshan relaxed, three trails of green smoke drifted out from their bodies.
<br><br>"You can't kill us, if you have the guts, come to the Explosive Sky Gang to find us, we are waiting for you, hahaha ......"
<br><br>The voice fell, the three green smoke disappeared in the twinkling of an eye.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>Qing Shan old man's face changed greatly, want to chase, but there is no way to do so, never thought that the three have such a secret method!
<br><br>"Yin Xiong."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan shouted in a hurry.
<br><br>"In."
<br><br>Yin Xiong hurriedly stood by.
<br><br>"You bring the heads of Mao Lin and the others to sir, I must go and take the lives of these three!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan commanded.
<br><br>"But, what about those other people in the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce who have nothing to do with this matter?" Yin Xiong asked respectfully.
<br><br>"Capture them first, not to miss any of them, and then ask for instructions, sir." After a slight pause, the Old Ancestor of Green Mountain said in a deep voice, "If sir says live, then they will live, if sir says kill, then they will die!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Yin Xiong hurriedly did as he was told.
<br><br>After dealing with the matter of Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, Lu Qingshan's face was gloomy as he led the eighteen guardians towards the Sky Blasters.
<br><br>Originally, he was still thinking whether it was too hasty to attack the Fried Heavenly Gang for the sake of these three people alone, after all, the disaster was not as bad as others, and what these three people committed might not have anything to do with the Fried Heavenly Gang.
<br><br>But now it seems that he must take a trip to the Fried Sky Gang.
<br><br>Other than that, the lives of these three people must be taken away.
