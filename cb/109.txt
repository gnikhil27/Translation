Yi Feng picked the centipede with a shovel.
<br><br>"Such a big centipede, how did it suddenly die a violent death?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was filled with wonder, such a frightening thing, would have liked to make up a shovel, but thought it was too disgusting, and ignored it.
<br><br>Subsequently, Yi Feng approached towards that old bastard again.
<br><br>Listening to the sound of Yi Feng's footsteps walking in, Bo Gu heart a burst of apprehension, but remembered that the night wind centipede will die pretending to escape the end of the look, he also slightly relaxed a little.
<br><br>"This old bastard is also dead?"
<br><br>Yi Feng kicked with his foot, thinking that it should be dropped to death, right?
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>Bo Gu breathed a sigh of relief, it seems that he did not reveal himself, I think he will soon be able to get out of danger.
<br><br>But he breathed a sigh of relief, then came Yi Feng's excited voice.
<br><br>"Such a large old Wang Biao is a great tonic ah, this take back a stew, just can give the apprentice a good tonic!"
<br><br>This sentence fell in the brain of Bo Gu, instantly resounded a thunderbolt!
<br><br>He tang demon emperor, actually be taken to stew?
<br><br>Bo Gu immediately failed to withstand this blow, anger plus the previous heavy fall, double black eyes, directly fainted.
<br><br>Yi Feng through the light of the flame beads, in the water next to grab up a handful of water grass, tied them into a grass rope, and then tied to the old king on the five flowers, lifting in the hands.
<br><br>Weighing, Yi Feng nodded his head in satisfaction, "this Wang Biao afraid there are several pounds, apprentice a person can not finish eating, another day call on old man Wu, old man Qingshan that also came together to make up for a few."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng took out the map again.
<br><br>"Cloud Road Flower!"
<br><br>"This medicine is not easy to find, I can only take my chances everywhere."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng picked up the bamboo basket and walked out of the water cave with Wang Ba in one hand.
<br><br>And Yi Feng left soon after, the night wind centipede only a roll up, full of palpitations, staring at the eyes filled with a strong fear.
<br><br>Thinking of the tragic state of the demon emperor, he no longer dared to stay, panicked and afraid to get out of the cave, perhaps because it was too anxious, and broke two legs, but still did not dare to stay, crawling towards the mountain range.
<br><br>"Come on, make a big sin!"
<br><br>"Everyone come out quickly, the Bo Gu Demon Emperor is going to be stewed into soup!"
<br><br>He shouted in panic while informing the nearby demons.
<br><br>Such a big event instantly alarmed the entire mountain range of large and small demons, and the eighteen demon kings who heard the news also rushed back and gathered in a gloomy canyon.
<br><br>"Night Wind Centipede, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>The Eagle King asked, flashing his sharp gaze and staring at the Night Wind Centipede.
<br><br>"Eighteen demon kings, you guys have to do something, that human is simply too ruthless."
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede said with a sobbing face: "That human broke into the cave of the demon emperor, not only pulled out the demon emperor's water spirit grass, but also captured the demon emperor said to go back to stew, and I also fought with him for 300 rounds, enough to pay the price of two legs, knew that he was unable to save the demon emperor, so I had to run out to give you guys the news ah! "
<br><br>"Humph, big talk!"
<br><br>Leopard King's majestic body out, staring at the night wind centipede said soberly: "Even the demon emperor was captured by that human, you a small centipede, where to get the strength to fight with that human 300 rounds?"
<br><br>With the questioning of the leopard king, the other demon kings looked at the night wind centipede with suspicion.
<br><br>"It's true!"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede hurriedly explained, "I was able to fight him for three hundred rounds because after the Demon King and him, he consumed a lot of power left in his body."
<br><br>Speaking of this, the night wind centipede eyes contain tears, full of shame said: "I thought I could save the demon emperor, but I a centipede ultimately limited strength, blame me, blame me, blame me useless!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the Eagle King and other people are not feeling good in their hearts.
<br><br>They knew they had wrongly blamed the night wind centipede.
<br><br>So quickly came, patted the night wind centipede shoulders, softly comforted: "Night wind demon spirit, just now we spoke too much, you do not have to take it to heart, we all know that you tried your best."
<br><br>"Yes, the effort you made to save the demon emperor, we all see it in our eyes." The Leopard King also said comfortingly, "You'd better take care of your injuries, let us do the saving of the Demon Emperor!"
<br><br>"This, how can this be a good idea?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede flashed his eyes and said embarrassedly.
<br><br>"You should out of the power has been out, the next good rest is good." The Monkey King said.
<br><br>At that, the others also nodded in agreement.
<br><br>"Well, all demon kings, then I will not be polite, I first go back to recuperate a few days, when the day of recovery, then come to help everyone."
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede said movingly, then transformed into his body and slowly crawled out towards the canyon beyond.
<br><br>Just crawling out of the canyon, he ran to an earthbag, dug out a pile of treasures, then quickly crawled towards the mountain range beyond, without looking back!
