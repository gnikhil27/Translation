The sky.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao stepped through the air, this time the destination is to go to Pingjiang City to find Yi Feng.
<br><br>The two have not seen each other since the 100,000 Great Mountains.
<br><br>As Pingjiang City gets closer and closer, Yun Yaoyao's heart can't help but recall the mortal who spent time with her in the Hundred Thousand Mountains that day, but with a little bit of hatred.
<br><br>Thinking about it, Yun Yoyao's pretty face can't help but spring up a smile.
<br><br>Thinking about the scene of one hundred thousand mountains, she is still a little unbelievable, like a dream.
<br><br>When she was a Martial Emperor, she relied on a mortal to save her life, and in that immortal ruin, she also relied on this mortal's beef jerky to escape from life.
<br><br>But also as a result.
<br><br>She was saddled with several million gold coins of foreign debt.
<br><br>"Huh!"
<br><br>Just as she swept through the sky like a stream of light, by the lake below, a large black umbrella caught her attention. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"A holy item?"
<br><br>She glanced at it casually.
<br><br>A treasure of this level, not bad.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>For her, it was only the extent of a glance.
<br><br>She was just about to continue flying over, but she suddenly found a series of complaining voices coming from underneath that large black umbrella.
<br><br>"Alas, nowadays there are more and more people eating, there's really not enough money to make ends meet."
<br><br>"The woman who was at the 100,000 Great Mountains, who promised to send me money, didn't even see a ghost."
<br><br>"True."
<br><br>"The woman's mouth cheat ghosts."
<br><br>"I should have known that at first let you damn starve to death in that secret passage."
<br><br>Although more and more disciples can allow him to embark on the path of cultivation sooner, but also corresponds to the expenses inside the sect will become larger and larger.
<br><br>The thought of dozens of mouths to eat, Yi Feng will feel anxious.
<br><br>When Yi Feng's voice sounded, Yun Yoyao had long since stepped on the air to stop.
<br><br>"Unexpectedly, I ran into this guy halfway!"
<br><br>"And this guy, for those millions of gold coins seems to have been nostalgic."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's black face, full of sorrow shouted: "Hey, who do you think you want to starve to death?"
<br><br>Hearing the sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng's head lifted and his eyes lit up.
<br><br>Good guy.
<br><br>Really say Cao Cao Cao Cao.
<br><br>"Big sister, are you here to return my money?" Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>This cry of big sister directly caused Yun Yoyo's face to become distorted, his gaze sank, and his voice said icily, "Who are you calling big sister?"
<br><br>"Uh?"
<br><br>"What's wrong with that?"
<br><br>Yi Feng froze and asked dumbly, "You're so powerful, at least you've been cultivating for hundreds and thousands of years."
<br><br>"Could it be, Grandma?"
<br><br>Yun Yiyao choked violently, his body cultivation agitated, almost did not fall headfirst inside the lake.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>This guy is still so hateful ah!
<br><br>But how can she endure this breath, body a flash, reappeared is already to Yi Feng's near, the hand longsword a wave, it fell to Yi Feng's neck.
<br><br>"You are not afraid that I will kill you?"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo's face was full of frost, and a word by word voice came out.
<br><br>Of course she did not have the idea of killing Yi Feng.
<br><br>Just, this guy's mouth so owed, how can not let him eat a little deflated, a good scare him?
<br><br>Then ask her for a bypass, to break back a city?
<br><br>But who knows, Yi Feng breathlessly white glance at her.
<br><br>Then the palm of his hand gently raised, plucked away the long sword on his neck, and said indifferently: "You've got to."
<br><br>Yun Yoyo frowned.
<br><br>How could this guy not be afraid.
<br><br>"Do you really think I don't dare to kill you?"
<br><br>Her voice was even colder.
<br><br>"Oh you do not engage in these fancy, if you want to kill you have already killed."
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a good-natured manner, "And when you were recovering from your injuries, we had an agreement, and you swore not to hurt me."
<br><br>"So if you kill me, not only will your cultivation be damaged, your dao heart will be broken, and your whole family will have to die, how unworthy is it?"
<br><br>The corners of Yun Xiaoyao's mouth twitched, and her body trembled violently.
<br><br>A thick anger rose up inside.
<br><br>Yi Feng that abominable appearance, she really hate a sword slash down.
<br><br>"Haven't seen you for a long time, you seem to be a lot prettier than before?" At this time, Yi Feng glanced at her again and couldn't help but praise.
<br><br>This sentence was like a scoop of cold water splashed on Yun Yoyo's body, and the fire that was bubbling up, she immediately cooled down a few points.
<br><br>This guy.
<br><br>Finally, there is a human word.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>Not with this mortal guy general understanding.
<br><br>"Do you let this girl stand here like this?" She asked.
<br><br>"Which can, sit here."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, gave up his recliner, and sat himself on the cobblestones next to him.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng's smile and subtle appearance as he got up and even forgot to wipe the water stains on the lounger, Yun Yaoyao's gaze moved slightly.
<br><br>This kid.
<br><br>Sometimes abominable is abominable, but sometimes quite cute.
<br><br>"Here, just picked the wild cucumber, the taste is great." Yi Feng took out another cucumber, washed it clean and wiped it, and handed it to Yun Yoyao.
<br><br>"Who wants to eat your cucumber?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao gave Yi Feng a white look, but found that she seemed to have a hard time refusing Yi Feng.
<br><br>Damn.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao ah Yun Yaoyao.
<br><br>You don't even put a magic pill in your eyes, how come you can't refuse a broken cucumber?
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Under the shame and anger in her heart, she pouted and took it angrily, then glared at the black umbrella above her head and asked viciously, "Let me ask you, where did this umbrella above your head come from?"
<br><br>"Umbrella?"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head, and then said seriously, "Forgotten."
<br><br>"Forgotten?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao frowned.
<br><br>"It seems to be a gift from someone else."
<br><br>Yi Feng thought about it and added.
<br><br>He indeed couldn't remember where this umbrella came from, there were just too many miscellaneous things at home.
<br><br>"Someone else gave it to me?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao face dark.
<br><br>This is not nonsense, if not from others, you a mortal guy, where to get such a holy umbrella?
