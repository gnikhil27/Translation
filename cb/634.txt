The good thing is that Yi Feng a rare hard back, to death to force the system, to ask for eleven hundred places.
<br><br>This quota includes one thousand human immortals, one hundred earth immortals.
<br><br>Think about the beginning.
<br><br>When he reached the Human Immortal, he was so happy that he wanted to stab the sky.
<br><br>Now.
<br><br>In one fell swoop, he was able to create 1,100 immortals, which was unimaginable in the past.
<br><br>It is really one person to achieve the path of the chicken and dogs rise to heaven.
<br><br>If so.
<br><br>Then a hundred places will be given to their own disciples.
<br><br>The remaining 1,000 places will be given to the old men and women on the island!
<br><br>It's just right that you want to take them to the immortal world to open up your eyes. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Greetings to the Master!"
<br><br>The disciples rushed in and knelt at Yi Feng's feet in unison.
<br><br>Rao Yi Feng knew that this group of disciples did not mix very well, but when seeing them, still could not help but be angry heart.
<br><br>Catching a bunch of ducks.
<br><br>Hold of holding a cabbage.
<br><br>Carrying a pot spoon.
<br><br>Riding the bull or the bull, and not change the kind.
<br><br>Others get a clay pagoda in the hand to pretend to be deep.
<br><br>This group of fancy cattle ghosts and snakes, is simply unpleasant to see.
<br><br>"You guys, very disappointing to me!"
<br><br>"Can the pattern be, a little higher?"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed heavily.
<br><br>A painful voice came out.
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>The crowd of disciples who were expecting to get compliments from Yi Feng, instantly prostrated on the ground, not feeling good in their hearts.
<br><br>Could it be that ......
<br><br>Still can't get the approval of the master?
<br><br>Their pattern, or not enough?
<br><br>Then what is the pattern that the master needs?
<br><br>"Please also ask the master to be clear."
<br><br>A fat man with a big trigger finger on his hand asked, shivering on his knees.
<br><br>"You, who is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at this guy.
<br><br>"Enlightened master, disciple ranked fifty, named Qian Duo Duo." The fatty said respectfully.
<br><br>"Wow." Yi Feng raised his head and seemed to have a slight impression and said, "I seem to remember hearing someone say that one of you runs a money bank."
<br><br>"It should be you, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Not bad, it is none other than the disciple." The fatty said respectfully, "I would like to ask Master, how exactly can I not let Master down?"
<br><br>"What do you think?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave him a white glance and said, "Although opening a money bank is not bad in your group of disciples, but simply opening a money bank has meaning?"
<br><br>"What I want is a monopoly."
<br><br>"Does monopoly understand?"
<br><br>"At least, that area where you are, monopoly in the hands understand?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lectured loudly.
<br><br>It's not that he was going to say him.
<br><br>Because in the immortal river continent to open a money bank, is really not a matter, take Pingjiang City, can withdraw money from a large number of money bank, a relationship, there is a little start-up capital to join a branch on the line.
<br><br>But, monopoly is different.
<br><br>Take Pingjiang City, to monopolize the money in the hands of the bank, is the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Look and see.
<br><br>The pattern is completely different.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Qian Duo Duo drew a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>So that's how it is.
<br><br>It turns out that Master's request is that he wants me to monopolize the money changers in the Immortal World.
<br><br>Ridiculous.
<br><br>Laughable, I thought I was complacent just because I became one of the top ten money changers in the Immortal World.
<br><br>So it seems.
<br><br>Far from enough ah!
<br><br>"Thank you, Master, my disciple has already understood, I will work hard for the goal that Master has given me."
<br><br>Qian Duoduo said respectfully.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>"Children can be taught!"
<br><br>Yi Feng appreciated.
<br><br>This appreciation made Qian Duoduo attract the envious eyes of all is brothers.
<br><br>Master.
<br><br>It actually praised Qian Duo Duo.
<br><br>"Then what am I, an Upper Three Continents Master, considered to be? According to the master's goal for senior brother Qian, then I correspond to the words ...... to be, to be the lord of the entire immortal world!" Su Yun Yun Yun darkly said.
<br><br>"Alas, I cultivate a group of divine phoenix on complacency, deliberately brought back, attempting to master see can praise on me, I am really ashamed, to cultivate, must cultivate the ultimate divine beast of the immortal world ah!" Jia Jia Qin secretly made up his mind.
<br><br>"I was able to make all the three continental lords in the middle of the continent empty hand catch white blade, thought it was very impressive, I do not know, in the eyes of the master, just a child's play, it seems that my future goal, is a sword down, can make everyone in the immortal world, empty hand catch white blade." Li Jin tightened the longsword in his hand.
<br><br>"Then my goal, is the future self-destruction, explode the immortal world together!" Hong Crazy's eyes flashed with madness.
<br><br>For a moment.
<br><br>The crowd was all enlightened.
<br><br>"Master, we know what to do."
<br><br>The crowd transmitted their voices in unison.
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>"Seeing that you guys are still obedient, I am going to give you a chance!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his palm and said leisurely.
<br><br>The eyes of the disciples lit up.
<br><br>Kneeling on the ground, full of expectation, "I wonder Master, what kind of chance to give us?"
<br><br>"Naturally, it is to directly let you have heavenly strength!" Yi Feng transmitted a solemn voice, and under the expectant gaze of the disciples, he said word by word, "Become an Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"?"
<br><br>"Earth Immortal?"
<br><br>The crowd of disciples had a question mark.
