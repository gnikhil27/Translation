In the solemn hall.
<br><br>A middle-aged man sat at the top, looking stereotypically neutral.
<br><br>Majestic incomparable.
<br><br>At this moment, Liu Yan prostrated himself in front of the man and whispered something.
<br><br>"I know." Long time, the middle-aged man opened his mouth, his voice was thick, giving people an invisible pressure.
<br><br>In the middle of the main hall was still kneeling Guo Shijie, with an anxious face.
<br><br>At this moment, seeing the middle-aged man speak, he straightened up and argued with his neck, "Sovereign, don't listen to this woman's nonsense!"
<br><br>"She is falsely accusing me!"
<br><br>Liu Yan loudly refuted, "Guo Shijie you still want to sophistry? If it weren't for you, who else could have done such despicable things to my Sun Moon Peak's outer sect secret realm!"
<br><br>"Bullshit!" Guo Shijie was also anxious, glaring with two round eyes and his cheeks turned red with anger, "Don't you dare to spit blood!"
<br><br>"I'm spitting blood? You know very well whether you have done it or not!" Liu Yan said angrily. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"If you have not done it, then what are you blushing?
<br><br>"You, you, you woman, want to put shit on my head? I tell you, you are just dreaming!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie was so furious that if he wasn't on his knees, he would have been so angry that he would have jumped to his feet!
<br><br>"Who else could it be if not you?!" Liu Yan angrily rebuked, "In the entire Sun Moon Sect, besides your Sun Moon Peak making things difficult and bullying us at every turn, who else would go and destroy our outer sect's secret realm!"
<br><br>"Who knows if it was your Star Peak's people who destroyed it themselves, in order to plant evidence against Laozi?!" Guo Shijie was so angry that he angrily glared at Liu Yan sarcastically.
<br><br>Liu Yan choked on his words, then turned back to look at the Sun Moon Sect Patriarch with an accusatory face.
<br><br>"Patriarch, listen! Still saying that he didn't do it? How could he even climb up to my Star Peak, how much importance my Star Peak attaches to that outer secret realm, others don't know, but you, Sovereign, understand best!"
<br><br>"How could we possibly destroy ourselves just to plant him?!"
<br><br>The more Liu Yan said, the angrier she became.
<br><br>Guo Shijie not only destroyed her outer secret realm, but also tried to put this shit on their heads!
<br><br>This is unbearable!
<br><br>Guo Shijie strained his neck and wanted to argue, but he was stopped by the Sun Moon Patriarch with a raised hand.
<br><br>No one dared to argue in the hall for a while.
<br><br>He looked at Guo Shijie, his gaze was deep and expressionless, "Star Peak attaches much importance to the outer secret realm, this seat understands very well. You also understand it very well."
<br><br>"It's impossible to do something like destroying the secret realm by yourself in order to frame you."
<br><br>When Guo Shijie heard these words, he was so scared that his back was wet with cold sweat.
<br><br>What does this mean? Is it really necessary to take this black pot yourself?
<br><br>No way!
<br><br>Guo Shijie raised his head to argue, but as far as he could see, the patriarch looked so majestic that he couldn't make any arguments.
<br><br>He swallowed his saliva with a resentful face and swallowed it back together with his arguments and grievances.
<br><br>"Only, if it is said that the Sun and Moon Peak is responsible for the ghost, you have no evidence for the time being." The patriarch paused and spoke slowly.
<br><br>Liu Yan smiled, his heart was anxious, and said anxiously, "Sovereign, if Guo Shijie is determined to destroy my secret realm, with his ability, he can definitely do it without leaving any traces!"
<br><br>The patriarch once again raised his hand, stopping Liu Yan's argument.
<br><br>The destruction of the outer sect's secret realm could not have been done by Star Peak's people themselves.
<br><br>Looking at the entire sect, only Sun Moon Peak could have done such a thing.
<br><br>"This throne knows." The sect head said and looked at Guo Shijie, "No matter how you look at this matter, it is Sun Moon Peak that is most suspected."
<br><br>"You say it's not you, how do you prove it's not you?" He condescendingly glared at Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Guo Shijie's heart sank as he listened.
<br><br>What the hell does that mean?
<br><br>It's obvious that he didn't do it himself! And now he wants to show proof that he didn't do it?
<br><br>Gam!
<br><br>How is he going to prove it?
<br><br>How is he supposed to prove it?
<br><br>"What, you can't produce evidence?" When the patriarch above saw this, his voice sank by three points.
<br><br>This voice was like a big stone instantly pressing down on Guo Shijie's heart.
<br><br>His heart panicked and he immediately replied back, "I have a way to prove it!"
<br><br>Absolutely cannot let the patriarch think that he did the tampering!
<br><br>The usual rivalry between him and Star Peak was tolerated by the patriarch because it was just a small fight for him.
<br><br>If it rises to the point of destroying resources within the sect for the sake of fighting, the patriarch will not tolerate it!
<br><br>"Oh? How to prove it." The patriarch spoke, and his voice eased a little.
<br><br>Only to see Guo Shijie will open his storage ring, pull out from inside a square object.
<br><br>Holding it in his hand for a last fleshy glance, then bowed his head and presented it righteously, "This object, Heavenly Spirit Tantalum, is offered."
<br><br>These words came out, Guo Shijie's heart was simply dripping blood!
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Tantalum was a treasure that he had at the bottom of his box.
<br><br>It was just that compared to the Sovereign's suspicion, he would rather endure the pain of taking this item out.
<br><br>Whether he did it or not, as long as this item was taken out, even Liu Yan could not pursue him any further.
<br><br>As long as Liu Yan is no longer unforgiving, the patriarch will not hold on to himself.
<br><br>"Although this item cannot create aura, it can change the structure of space in the place where aura is born. With this object holding the outer secret realm in check, it will only take one night to restore the aura in the outer secret realm." Guo Shijie said.
<br><br>The patriarch swept his gaze over the thing in Guo Shijie's hand and was slightly shocked.
<br><br>Even this thing had been brought out.
<br><br>Whether he did it or not, at least this attitude, was the attitude to handle things.
<br><br>And with this Heavenly Spirit Tantalum, then the problem of the outer sect secret realm was not a problem anymore.
<br><br>The patriarch turned his head and looked at Liu Yan.
<br><br>"How is it?"
<br><br>After all, Liu Yan was the one in question.
<br><br>Although Liu Yan was resentful in his heart, but the patriarch had spoken, and Guo Shijie's Heavenly Spirit Tantalum was also taken out.
<br><br>Even if he did not want to let Guo Shijie go, he could not hold on to it.
<br><br>So face indignantly lowered his head, "All according to the patriarch to decide."
<br><br>At the word of the patriarch's hand, Guo Shijie's Heavenly Spirit Tantra appeared in her hand.
<br><br>He handed it to Liu Yan, "Then this matter will end here."
<br><br>Liu Yan received the Heavenly Spirit Tantra and her face was not happy, she glared at Guo Shijie with dissatisfaction.
<br><br>With this glance Guo Shijie exploded.
<br><br>How how?
<br><br>He didn't even do anything, he even offered the Heavenly Spirit Tantalum, and she still glared at me?
<br><br>There is no heavenly justice? There is no king's law anymore?
<br><br>"Patriarch, wait!" Guo Shijie's anger rose and he said with a stubborn neck, "Since I can take out this item for the restoration of the outer secret realm, it means that the outer secret realm could not have been destroyed by me."
<br><br>"Furthermore, you clearly sent word before, Sovereign, that this disciple trial, whichever peak wins, the outer sect secret realm will be returned."
<br><br>"My Sun and Moon Peak is the strongest among the three peaks of the outer sect, so it has the best chance of winning. That is to say, three days later, the disciple competition, the probability will be my Sun and Moon Peak to win the top. So how would I lift a stone to smash my own feet at this time and destroy the outer sect secret realm?"
<br><br>"If you ask me, it's because Star Peak knows that it will lose in this Disciple Trial Competition, so it will destroy what it can't get and simply destroy the outer secret realm! Just in time to frame me!"
<br><br>"And blackmailed me for a Heavenly Spirit Tantalum!"
<br><br>"Bloodthirsty!" Liu Yan easily suppressed the fire again, "three days later is the disciple trial conference, these three days I am about to let them go in to cultivate to improve, and how will destroy the secret realm?
<br><br>Others do not know, Guo Shijie most know that this thing he did not do.
<br><br>Seeing the two people to quarrel again, the patriarch impatiently got up, a wave of the palm of his hand sober voice.
<br><br>"I said this is the end of this time."
<br><br>The words fell, the two dare not say more.
<br><br>Patriarch figure also disappeared in situ.
<br><br>Only after the people disappeared did Guo Shijie look at Liu Yan, indignant.
<br><br>"You blackmailed me!"
