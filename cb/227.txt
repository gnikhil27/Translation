The two sect masters' faces were gloomy and furious to the extreme.
<br><br>After Yang Tianyu and Li Shuhua looked at each other, they gave a direct order.
<br><br>"All listen to the order, we two hold Song Ke in check, the Martial Exalted Elders hold the rest of the Demon Exalted, and the rest of the disciples take the opportunity to retreat."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>With the order, Yang Tianyu two long swords held in the air, turned into two streams of light swept up towards the sky, towards Song Ke attack.
<br><br>And more than a dozen martial elders and martial elders also erupted into a great battle!
<br><br>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the disciples of the two sects also began to retreat at the same time.
<br><br>"Hmph, Song Ke, this time's revenge will be avenged in the future, and we will always get back that incense bag in the future." Li Shuhua two while fighting with Song Ke, while coldly shouting.
<br><br>"Do you really think you can leave?" Song Ke sneered.
<br><br>"Humph, if you were here in your original body, we naturally couldn't leave, but now ......"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu two sword light destruction, a Prime like attack coming tree roots were cut into pieces by them. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Of course, although cutting down these tree roots could not cause actual harm to Song Ke, but thus they were able to hold Song Ke back and let the disciples under the sect retreat peacefully, their purpose was achieved.
<br><br>"Think too much."
<br><br>That expressionless big face gaze down stage, cold gaze at the below like ants fleeing the crowd of disciples, said in a deep voice: "deal with the rest of you, pinch some ants or simple."
<br><br>As his voice fell, the earth suddenly roared.
<br><br>Then we saw that the ground cracked a bottomless crack, while countless vines appeared, binding the disciples' hands and feet, pulling them away from the cracks in the ground.
<br><br>For a while, the ground screamed noisily.
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu both immediately panicked and hurriedly shouted, "Retreat, retreat, retreat back."
<br><br>Hearing this, the disciples cried out and returned to their original camp.
<br><br>And seeing the disciples retreating hopelessly, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu and others, also withdrew in time and fell back to the camp with a face full of gloom.
<br><br>After looking around, they found that they had just directly lost one-fifth of the people.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu was gloomy to the extreme, and there was even a look of despair in his eyes.
<br><br>If they, the high level battle force, wanted to leave, they might have a chance, but the other disciples wanted to leave, but it was simply impossible.
<br><br>The whole camp fell into a silence.
<br><br>Things were so grim that it was beyond the imagination of the people.
<br><br>"You guys, just stay here and wait for death!" High in the air, the large expressionless face gave them a faint glance, and then closed its eyes again.
<br><br>The other Demon Dignitaries, too, apparently had no intention to take the initiative to attack.
<br><br>Apparently, Song Ke was not in a hurry to make an immediate move in order to minimize his losses, and I'm afraid he wanted to wait for a breakthrough before taking action himself.
<br><br>And now, it is only necessary to hold Li Shuhua and others unable to leave.
<br><br>This is a deadlock for the Royal Sword Sect and the Li family.
<br><br>Numerous top brass are anxious.
<br><br>Go, can not go.
<br><br>If we wait, until Song Ke breaks through to become a saint, then the chances of being able to escape, is even slimmer.
<br><br>"Big brother, just ahead, just ahead."
<br><br>At this time, not far from the jungle, three voices appeared, the night wind centipede lying on the dog's head, pointing ahead, "there is a demon emperor I once followed the buried treasure child, that old man likes to collect these things, there are many, many gold coins."
<br><br>"Brother, I think I also smell the smell of gold coins." Ao Qing, the dog, also said.
<br><br>"Ah ah ha ha ha, I also feel it, go ah Qing ah, follow me rush ah, golden gold coins beckons us!"
<br><br>"Wuhu ......"
