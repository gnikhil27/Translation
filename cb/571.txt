The demon drought hovering in mid-air stirred up the wind and waves, and he roared.
<br><br>The entire Black Sea sea began to tremble.
<br><br>"Quack!"
<br><br>The toad was lying on the surface of the sea, tilting its head and shouting at the demon demon.
<br><br>It seemed to be a bit dissatisfied with not being heeded.
<br><br>Not to mention the mere toad's cry, even the Shadow Wolf's hiss was covered up by the Demon Demon's roar at this moment.
<br><br>You simply can't hear the slightest.
<br><br>But the weirdest of the weird is that this small toad's cry can penetrate through the demon demon's roar and reach his ears clearly.
<br><br>The demon demon in mid-air lowered his head, his blood-red eyes looked at the toad.
<br><br>A giant thing suspended, a weakness lying almost invisible on the surface of the Black Sea.
<br><br>"Quack!" The toad strained its neck and barked again at the demon demon. Clearly expressing his dissatisfaction. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The demon drought moved its body and arrived right above the toad.
<br><br>"Little toad, how dare you bark at this daddy." A low and suppressed voice came from the Devil Demon Goddess eventually, with a strong sense of disdain and playfulness.
<br><br>"But, after all, there is no mutation in this Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>"Interesting."
<br><br>He said, and the thick liquid with a fishy smell from his eyes dripped down, just hitting the toad's body.
<br><br>The toad was startled and hurriedly drilled down the water to rub his back vigorously.
<br><br>"Vomit ......"
<br><br>"You are not even yet corrupted by my saliva, but can be used as a plaything." The demon demon continued, "It just so happens that there doesn't seem to be much essence either."
<br><br>The thick liquid from the eyes kept dripping down, all falling on the toad's freshly rubbed clean back.
<br><br>"Wait for me to swallow this Dark Shadow Island essence ......"
<br><br>But before the words were finished, a tongue as thin as a thread shot out from the toad's mouth extremely fast to wrap around the demon drought.
<br><br>The next moment, the sudden appearance of the blood-basin mouth swallowed him.
<br><br>With a speed that is invisible to the naked eye, it passes in a flash.
<br><br>The demon drought in the sky to death are staring.
<br><br>But in the blink of an eye, it disappeared.
<br><br>The black sea surging waves also calm.
<br><br>Only the toad lying on the surface of the sea kept dry heaving.
<br><br>It is disgusted, can not wait to vomit out the throat together.
<br><br>No, no, we have to do something more to suppress this disgusting smell!
<br><br>It pulled the short legs to swim deep into the black sea.
<br><br>In the distance, the frightened Jiang to also found something wrong.
<br><br>The roar disappeared, the oppressive force also disappeared. Can't help but be surprised, gaze indecisive.
<br><br>Just in her current state, she is not capable of figuring out what the hell is going on here.
<br><br>And at the same time.
<br><br>In the barrier valley at the end of the Black Sea, a man was sitting cross-legged.
<br><br>He didn't have a single hair on his head, but there was a black mark.
<br><br>It made it look arcane and mysterious.
<br><br>At the same time, his strange face and smooth head, as well as his exposed arms, were covered with all kinds of weird tattoos.
<br><br>There are bizarre patterns and ugly and strange-looking fierce creatures.
<br><br>At this moment, above his arm, a terrible tattoo faded away.
<br><br>A pair of eyes suddenly opened, no eyes only the whites of the eyes, appalling and horrible.
<br><br>"Why is the demon drought breath gone?!"
<br><br>He said, looking down at his arm.
<br><br>The original devil drought pattern that was stabbed on it was unexpectedly gone.
<br><br>The bald man was shocked, "The demon drought is dead!" He said, "What's going on?"
<br><br>He closed his eyes to recall the Devil Drought's breath, but found that not only was the Devil Drought dead, he couldn't even find the corpse ...... at all!
<br><br>The man opened his eyes and his face was serious and appalling.
<br><br>The next moment, a pattern on his head gradually emerged.
<br><br>The pattern slowly grew larger until it became a chaos demon, covered with a fog, with the fresh air of the long-ago valley.
<br><br>The Chaos Devil prostrated his body and lay down in front of the bald man.
<br><br>"What does the master summon me to do?"
<br><br>"Go to the island and see what's going on over at the Demon Demon." The man commanded.
<br><br>"Yes." The Chaos Devil answered and its body disappeared flat on the ground.
<br><br>In an instant, it was out of the valley and above the Black Sea.
<br><br>The Chaos Devil was at the end of the Black Sea, looking around for the scent of the Demon Drought.
<br><br>There was not a trace of it.
<br><br>The Chaos Devil was ready to go directly to the Devil Drought's residence.
<br><br>As soon as he moved, he was entangled by something.
<br><br>Chaos Demon tried to move, but found that he could not move.
<br><br>He looked down and looked around, and his eyes fell on a toad.
<br><br>Only then did he realize that the little toad had a long, thin tongue sticking out of its mouth and was tying itself up.
<br><br>Chaos Devil was furious, "A mere toad dares to make a fool of himself in front of this daddy!"
<br><br>The next moment, the toad withdrew its tongue.
<br><br>"Hmph, you also know that you are afraid?" The Chaos Devil carried his dissatisfaction, "Unfortunately, it's too late."
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>Chaos Devil raised his hand to slap at the toad.
<br><br>The toad didn't react, just smashed his mouth a few times and looked at the Chaos Devil's eyes lit up.
<br><br>The next moment, the Chaos Devil disappeared in mid-air.
<br><br>The little toad below hiccuped in satisfaction.
<br><br>Also at the same time, the bald man in the valley, who had just closed his eyes, spurted out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>He stood up in horror and touched his bare head.
<br><br>Chaos devil how suddenly also gone?
<br><br>What the hell, what the hell happened here?
<br><br>The bald man sat down, closed his eyes, formed a seal with his palms, and chanted the words under his breath.
<br><br>A time when the space around him began to distort ......
<br><br>"Retrospective eyes art, Kai!"
