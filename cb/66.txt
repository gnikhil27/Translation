The appearance of this figure immediately caused the crowd present to exclaim.
<br><br>Because the hand of this is also a stunning beauty, compared to Mao Yun'er not only not inferior, that charming gesture out of the rhyme, but also squinted many people's souls upside down.
<br><br>What's more.
<br><br>This than Mao Yuner strike more ruthless ah!
<br><br>Peng Ying that melon face, a reddish slap marks soon showed up.
<br><br>For a while, countless people cast Yi Feng's eyes towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>They were all guessing what kind of person Yi Feng was, actually able to cause these two women to help each other.
<br><br>The later woman was no other.
<br><br>It was none other than Demon Ling'er!
<br><br>The fiery pain on her face almost made Peng Ying lose her mind, she did not expect that she actually received another slap!
<br><br>What makes her think more, the reason for beating her is actually still this man she abandoned, this waste, this mole ...... one second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>With murderous intent bubbling straight from her eyes, staring deadly at Demon Ling'er, Peng Ying shouted hatefully, "Who are you again?"
<br><br>"I'm also a fan of Mister."
<br><br>The corners of Demon Ling'er's mouth lifted up, her heart already had something to say, and she said calmly.
<br><br>In the past two days in Pingjiang City, she had long ago scouted out the details of this mysterious youth, although he was a supreme expert, he never revealed his mountain or water.
<br><br>This kind, is obviously the kind of old monster who returns to the basics to feel life.
<br><br>Because according to her prying, this will be the mortal life experience to the extreme, clothing, food, housing, transportation, three meals a day, human affairs and so on ...... are personally, carried out with mortals no different.
<br><br>So she understands that even though her cultivation is exposed at a glance in his eyes, she still has to pretend to be a mortal to approach him without ruining his original intention of experiencing mortal life.
<br><br>And the saying of a fan just became the best thing she could say.
<br><br>"Another fan?"
<br><br>Peng Ying revealed a malevolent look, his chest heaving violently in anger.
<br><br>Wasn't it just a broken book, what made it possible for a trash she had dumped to be glued to a woman one after another?
<br><br>What is even more unacceptable to her is that these two women are not inferior to her, whether from origin, appearance or figure, they are enough to crush her.
<br><br>The good thing is, these two women have no cultivation at all.
<br><br>Since they did not have cultivation, they were also wastes in Peng Ying's eyes, just good-looking vases.
<br><br>"Good fan, since you two bitchy girls want to meddle in my business, then you will face destruction!" Peng Ying coldly shouted, a long sword in his hand, while exposing so cultivation aura.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Cultivator?"
<br><br>"It's actually a cultivator?"
<br><br>The crowd of onlookers felt Peng Ying's unreserved aura and were shocked to realize that the Peng Ying in front of them was actually a cultivator.
<br><br>Inevitably, they cast awe towards Peng Ying.
<br><br>Although in this poetry conference is not based on strength status, but the real fact is that cultivators are able to cause awe in any place.
<br><br>"Now, this man and two women will be miserable!"
<br><br>"Yes, I guess Mao Yun'er those two women also regret in their hearts, actually a slap this female cultivator."
<br><br>"It's a pity that these two such beautiful creatures ah!"
<br><br>The crowd was talking, and many people even looked at Yi Feng and Demon Ling'er three with pity.
<br><br>The awe-inspiring actions of the crowd and the chattering words caused Peng Ying's chin to lift slightly, with a strong pride on her face.
<br><br>She was enjoying this kind of awe.
<br><br>Also enjoy this feeling of being feared.
<br><br>Now, it was her turn to slowly humiliate these three, so let's start with these two bitchy women.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er trembled in fear, she is a weak woman, where has withstood the pressure of cultivators, her face immediately changed color, the whole pretty face became bloodless.
<br><br>"What, didn't you hit me pretty hard just now?" Peng Ying said icily, "How come you're not ruthless now?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er's face was miserably white, not daring to say half a word.
<br><br>"I am now, telling you to kneel down."
<br><br>Peng Ying threatened again.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er's face changed greatly and she was busy shaking her head, this kind of humiliation was really hard for her to accept.
<br><br>"No kneeling?"
<br><br>Peng Ying's face was cold, and with a long sword in his hand, he instantly forced himself towards Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The long sword attacked, Mao Yun'er pouted out, before the sword arrived, the whole person was paralyzed with fear.
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Ying revealed a disdainful smile.
<br><br>"Ants are ants, my sword hasn't even landed on you yet, how come it's like this?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er's pretty body trembled, still not daring to speak half a word, full of fear for Peng Ying.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er's pitiful gaze, let Peng Ying enjoy an unprecedented pleasure g, this, is the status that cultivators should have, not mortal mole crickets can be compared to.
<br><br>Fiercely.
<br><br>She again turned her icy gaze to the demon Ling'er, while the body pressure turned the gun, but also straight at the demon Ling'er.
<br><br>This woman, that slap was even heavier than Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>She is bound to be ruthlessly humiliated to do so.
<br><br>PS: something today, plus a heavy cold, only strong hold out two chapters, this is the first chapter later there is a chapter, tomorrow four more compensation for everyone, sorry.
