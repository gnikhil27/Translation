"One turn of Nirvana now!"
<br><br>Right at this moment, Su Yunyun's eyes moved and narrowed deeply.
<br><br>She possessed a nine-transformation Heavenly God Body, and each turn of nirvana would substantially improve her talent and qi, and it was because of this physique that she had reached the Immortal Emperor realm in just a few hundred years.
<br><br>Even at the Immortal Emperor realm, her ninth-transformation Heavenly God Body had only reached six turns of nirvana, and if she could reach nine turns of nirvana, she would be able to step into the legendary God realm.
<br><br>This kind of physique can be considered the favorites of the heavens.
<br><br>Only.
<br><br>This physique also has a very obvious drawback, that is, every time nirvana, their five senses will be greatly shielded, cultivation will also completely disappear, become a complete and utter mortal.
<br><br>Only when nirvana is complete will it slowly rise back to a new height.
<br><br>The reason why she fell in her previous life was because of the treacherous people who seized the opportunity to murder her when she had no cultivation in her seventh turn.
<br><br>The reason why she is so confident after being reborn is because she is carrying the nine revolutions of the Heavenly God reborn, because as long as there are nine revolutions of the Heavenly God body in, back to the previous realm, or even more than a chip is just a matter of time.
<br><br>However. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>What made her unprepared was that the first turn of Nirvana came so quickly that there was no suitable place to successfully spend Nirvana.
<br><br>Unable to help, she turned her gaze to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Can you find a safer place for me to stay?" She couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"You don't have to worry about the place to stay." Yi Feng said softly, "You can just come back to the Heaven and Earth Sect with me directly."
<br><br>"No, I mean, find a different place where there are no other people." Su Yunyun said solemnly.
<br><br>After all, this matter of Nirvana was very important to her, and although the Heaven and Earth Sect was not in the top class, there would inevitably be other people present, and it was inevitable that there would be more people than one.
<br><br>"Another place, you do not return to the Heaven and Earth Gate with me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face sank.
<br><br>You her damn, I have come a long way to bring you back, you do not add heaven and earth door?
<br><br>"No, it's not, I mean ......"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun frowned, originally wanted to vaguely tell Yi Feng about the powerful relationship, but said it and was afraid of scaring Yi Feng, after all, Yi Feng such a mortal, where has been exposed to such things as the Nine Turning Heavenly God Body?
<br><br>Besides, this is her own bottom card, and she can't just tell others.
<br><br>Faintly rolling her eyes, she had to say, "I've been a little uncomfortable lately, not too convenient to be in a crowded place, and I only need a few days."
<br><br>"As long as you can find a place to settle me down, I will definitely join your Heaven and Earth Sect after a few days."
<br><br>"But you must make sure this place is safe."
<br><br>Su Yunyun didn't lie to Yi Feng either.
<br><br>After successfully recovering from the first turn, her strength would increase significantly, and the sect's entry or not would not have much impact on her.
<br><br>If Yi Feng could really settle her down, he would owe him a favor.
<br><br>When the time comes to join his heaven and earth door, to help slightly support support, is also considered to have returned this favor.
<br><br>"Oh, not feeling well."
<br><br>"Aunt?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"What aunt?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun frowned.
<br><br>"Forget it's nothing."
<br><br>Thinking that people in this other world also couldn't understand, so Yi Feng didn't say more, he said, "Since you really have something to hide and insist on finding a place to stay for a few days, that's a good solution, I happen to have a martial arts school, you can go there to stay for a few days!"
<br><br>"Martial arts school?"
<br><br>"Is it safe?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun asked solemnly.
<br><br>"Don't worry, it's very safe."
<br><br>Yi Feng said reassuringly.
<br><br>Su Yunyun nodded, feeling the power in her body had completely disappeared, and right now she had to trust Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Old Qing ah, you go back first, I'll take her to the martial arts school."
<br><br>Yi Feng ordered in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Yes, sir."
<br><br>Qing Huanxiang led the carriage in the direction of the island.
<br><br>And after Qing Huan Xiang left, Yi Feng's gaze slightly moved.
<br><br>This whole way over, he could see that perhaps because he had seen too many powerful cultivators at the Apprentice Acceptance Ceremony, this sister was a bit unconvinced of him.
<br><br>Originally, according to Yi Feng's character, you do not serve me, you hurry as far away as possible to get away.
<br><br>But right now for the sake of the system task can not help, it is not easy to touch a common, can not let her run away.
<br><br>So, he had to show a hand, pretend to let the girl take a good look at it.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>He raised his palm, a flying sword took out, while gently jumped and stepped on it.
<br><br>"Come up."
<br><br>Yi Feng stepped on the flying sword and said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Su Yunyun glanced at Yi Feng and then at Pingjiang City, which was some distance away, and also stepped on the flying sword.
<br><br>As Yi Feng's mind moved, the flying sword suddenly stuck to the ground and flew towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"See, in fact, I am still very strong, only I am a low-key person, usually do not want to show off, when you join the Heaven and Earth Gate, I will teach you well, do not worry." Yi Feng said while flying, while immortal aura towards Su Yunyun behind him.
<br><br>Su Yunyun rolled her eyes.
<br><br>This flying sword when Yi Feng took it out, she did feel some extraordinary, but where extraordinary she did not see, after all, at this moment she lost her cultivation because of Nirvana.
<br><br>However, it doesn't matter if you can't really see it.
<br><br>Because even if some extraordinary, but also just a flying sword, against the sky is also flying slightly faster.
<br><br>This level of things, in the cultivation world completely belong to the broken goods.
<br><br>And this is such a piece of junk, this person actually still in front of her show up?
<br><br>It really made her laugh.
<br><br>I really don't know, after she turns one nirvana, will sacrifice her immortal sword, Yi Feng will be scared into what kind.
