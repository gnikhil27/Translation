But just as she thought that, another whip leg came over and kicked her hard.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng immediately grinned up the mouth of the demon wolf, eyes deadly stared at the black-robed man, all the killing intent straight up.
<br><br>"You damn still stare!?"
<br><br>Another kick on Ao Qingcheng's buttocks.
<br><br>The monstrous anger, huge humiliation let Ao Qingcheng angry body trembling, but at this moment she let alone counterattack, even want to speak all seem extremely difficult.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>The black-robed man haughtily grunted, but still had no intention of letting them go, kicking them one foot at a time, while not knowing where to get a whip, smacking them all over the hall, wailing.
<br><br>That is called playing is a happy!
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lying on the recliner just fell asleep, suddenly awakened by these owl sounds, sat up violently. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Then rubbed his eyes and walked towards the front hall in a daze.
<br><br>Hearing the footsteps, the black-robed man who was having fun fiercely lay down towards the middle of Ao Qingcheng and them, with one foot and one hand reaching into the mouths of two of the demon wolves, and holding one up in his hand on his chest.
<br><br>Accompanied by a struggle of the black-robed man, while his mouth shouted out a voice.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>"Abba Baba, do not bite me ah ......"
<br><br>"Baba Baba ...... help, help ......"
<br><br>Walked out of Yi Feng just saw this scene, suddenly sleepy, manipulated a stretcher and rushed over.
<br><br>"Where is the wild dog, actually run to my martial arts school to bite my people?"
<br><br>Yi Feng heart fuming with anger, a flat stretcher a flat stretcher pumping in this group of vicious dogs, although usually he is considered a dog lover, but against this kind of vicious dogs, he still will not be merciful.
<br><br>The skeleton was rescued only after the group of vicious dogs were all dying.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>Skeleton head scared to hide behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Get out of the way, don't get in my way, which cool where to stay." Yi Feng gave him a white look and pushed him behind him, while turning his gaze to the group of dying vicious dogs and thinking about how to deal with them.
<br><br>Just at that moment, Ao Qing walked out with a fart.
<br><br>Looking at the sky-devouring demon wolves on the ground, his body was suddenly stunned, and his eyes were about to fall out. Especially, it was the white demon wolf on the ground that was emitting a hateful gaze, and the dog almost shouted out in shock.
<br><br>However, shocked at the same time, his heart was also full of excitement, a proud aura rose out.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>As the master's pet, Brother Skull's little brother, it was impossible to be bullied.
<br><br>The tiny Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, the so-called Saint Girl, are nothing more than that.
<br><br>And Yi Feng saw the dogs that walked out before he realized that this group of vicious dogs was actually the same breed as his family's Wangcai dogs.
<br><br>Eyes, can not help but fierce bright.
<br><br>He was bothered by this, since they all came to the door, he could not bear it.
<br><br>So, he grabbed one of the dogs and lifted it up, while bending down and looking at it.
<br><br>And couldn't resist flicking it with his hand.
<br><br>"Male dog!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head and threw this male dog to the door.
<br><br>Then grabbed another head.
<br><br>It was still a male dog.
<br><br>Threw it out again.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not get discouraged, he did not believe it, so many dogs inside there is not a female dog.
<br><br>After trying one by one and throwing it away, finally when he grabbed the last white dog, his eyes lit up, slapped his thighs and shouted, "It's done!"
<br><br>After saying that, he closed the door and carried that white dog to Ao Qing's front.
<br><br>"Dog, your spring has come."
<br><br>"Get on her!"
<br><br>Said, throwing that white dog to Ao Qing's face.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words immediately made Ao Qing's eyes widen, and looked at the limbless Ao Qingcheng, and his heart was flooded with shocking waves.
<br><br>The master actually ......
<br><br>He swallowed a mouthful of saliva!
<br><br>"What are you still frozen for, don't you already want to?"
<br><br>Yi Feng pushed and urged.
<br><br>Ao Qing's body trembled slightly and cast a reverent gaze toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>I didn't expect that the master even knew this thought in my heart, and wanted to fulfill this wish of mine!
<br><br>Aye.
<br><br>That's right.
<br><br>His dog Ao Qing had always wanted to finish off Ao Qingcheng, not only was he before, but he was even more so now.
<br><br>In his opinion, Ao Qingcheng set him up to bring him harm, kill her are not enough to vent his anger, only to finish her, is enough to vent his hatred!
<br><br>Both so ......
<br><br>He clenched his teeth and turned his gaze towards Ao Qingcheng.
<br><br>"You ...... you you ......"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng mouth wailing, but was suppressed can not make a sound, more do not understand this person in the end is to Ao Qing what to do to her, said the words and what is the meaning.
<br><br>Just between her guesses, the dog Ao Qing rushed over fiercely.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The white Sky Devouring Demon Wolf let out a wail, her eyes fiercely widened, flashing with a strong color of disbelief, and her mind instantly turned blank.
<br><br>She was the holy maiden of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>The existence that countless demon clans worshiped.
<br><br>The hope of the Red Sun Clan, the future number one.
<br><br>Surprisingly, she was given ...... by this trash Ao Qing
