"And."
<br><br>"I remember that among you, there are some good-looking daughters?"
<br><br>"Dress them up for me and send them over too."
<br><br>Wu Tian said again.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>A commotion came from the crowd at the scene.
<br><br>Not understanding why Wu Tian had to make such a big deal.
<br><br>After all, not everyone had attended the banquet that night and knew what this gentleman and big brother represented to Wu Tian.
<br><br>Two of the ministers thus turned pale and knelt down directly.
<br><br>"King of the country, I still hope to spare my little daughter."
<br><br>"Yes, my little daughter is only eighteen, I still hope to spare her!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Anxious voices came from the two men.
<br><br>If Wu Tian had taken a fancy to their daughter, they would not have hesitated.
<br><br>But who the hell knows what kind of person this gentleman is?
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Wu Tian, however, let out a cold snort, steeped in anger, and the table next to him abruptly turned into crushed.
<br><br>"Giving you opportunities and still unwilling?"
<br><br>"Drag them out."
<br><br>"Chop it up!"
<br><br>Wu Tian waved his hand and gave a direct order.
<br><br>"No, the kingdom ruler spare your life!"
<br><br>"State Sovereign, we were wrong."
<br><br>The two men emitted piteous voices, but Wu Tian simply ignored them and was directly dragged down.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>The sound of two heads falling to the ground came out, and the two had become headless dead bodies.
<br><br>The King's wrath scared the crowd into silence, not daring to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>"One last warning to you."
<br><br>"If it weren't for sir and my big brother, there wouldn't be me today, and there wouldn't be the strong Wu Tian Empire today."
<br><br>"All of you must unconditionally fulfill the demands of sir and big brother, and anyone who shows them any half-hearted disrespect will directly exterminate the nine clans!"
<br><br>Wu Tian's unquestionable voice came out, and all the people knelt down and answered.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>"Come with me to meet with Sir."
<br><br>Wu Tian got up and couldn't wait to rush off.
<br><br>"Lord Sovereign, my old servant understands your urgency to see that gentleman, just what about this battlefield right now?" At this moment, an old, old man, stepped out and asked.
<br><br>"Battlefield?"
<br><br>Wu Tian lightly glanced at it and waved his hand carelessly, "Give it to them, don't want it."
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Don't want it?"
<br><br>The old man was filled with shock and hurriedly said respectfully, "Lord Kun, after all, we have been campaigning here for half a year, and we are about to take it, plus you wounded the Wind Whisperer king, if we miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it won't be so easy next time!"
<br><br>"If you miss it, you miss it, it doesn't matter."
<br><br>Wu Tian still didn't care and said, "Anyway, there is nothing more important now than meeting Sir and my big brother."
<br><br>"And if it makes my big brother happy, he'll take the time to come over and fart, and this place will be taken straight away."
<br><br>Wu Tian's words.
<br><br>The crowd was speechless.
<br><br>The hearts were also filled with curiosity about this gentleman and that big brother.
<br><br>Soon after.
<br><br>Wu Tian arrived at Yuancheng with a dozen experts.
<br><br>Originally, he wanted to bring everyone, but only after he thought carefully, those whose strength was too poor and whose character was not good enough were not qualified to come at all.
<br><br>That's why only a dozen elites were selected.
<br><br>These elites.
<br><br>Basically all of these years and he fought in the blood, basically are the existence of the battle merit.
<br><br>But also because of this, these people's bodies are carrying some bloodthirsty smell, there are many people still left on the body of the expert left and can not recover the scars.
<br><br>Think about it.
<br><br>With his status today, plus such a group of elite experts, should not let Mr. and big brother too disappointed, right?
<br><br>As for those holy maidens of the sects under his jurisdiction, as well as the minister's daughters, they were arranged by him among a vacant red building.
<br><br>Because he knew very well.
<br><br>His own big brother likes this tone, likes this atmosphere.
<br><br>After arranging all this, Wu Tian led the crowd all the way to Yuan Jing's residence.
<br><br>Seeing this mansion, Bai Yanchun stared in disbelief.
<br><br>"Father, father, the gentleman who made Lord Kunming come to see him at all costs lives here?" Bai Yanchun asked in horror.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Bai Lingtian nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Bai Yanchun was flooded with waves of shock.
<br><br>Finally, he understood why Bai Lin Tian had smoked him.
<br><br>This was to remind him.
<br><br>Don't ever hit on Yuan Jing's attention.
<br><br>"Not willing?"
<br><br>Bai Lingtian looked at him.
<br><br>"I don't dare."
<br><br>Bai Yanchun lowered his head.
<br><br>Even though Yuan Jing was concerned about his cultivation, but what could be done?
<br><br>In front of this kind of person, let alone one Julia Yuan, even if it was ten hundred Julia Yuan, he could only give up his hand.
<br><br>Bai Lingtian patted Bai Yanchun's shoulder.
<br><br>This son of his, in addition to good talent, what he appreciated more was the knowledge of the times.
<br><br>"Sir, big brother, Little Chicken is here to see you."
<br><br>At the door, Wu Tian's eyes were filled with tears and he knelt down directly.
<br><br>The rest of the people also knelt behind.
<br><br>Hearing the sound from outside, Yi Feng walked out with Bone Ben Wei and Jing Yuan and the others.
<br><br>"Sir, big brother."
<br><br>Seeing the situation in person, Wu Tian was even bawling, and the voice coming out was full of choking.
<br><br>"Yo yo, it's really a little chicken, grow up."
<br><br>Yi Feng saw the situation, also revealed a pleased smile, touched Wu Tian's head, helped up.
<br><br>A thought.
<br><br>It's been many years since I've seen it.
<br><br>At that time, the skeleton Ben Wei also just out of the system not long ago, there is no Zhong Qing and dog around.
<br><br>In sigh.
<br><br>Yi Feng led the people into the house.
<br><br>In the hall, only Yi Feng and Wu Tian were seated, and everyone else did not dare to take a seat.
<br><br>"You sit down too!"
<br><br>Looking at Yuan Jing next to him, Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yuan Jing's body trembled gently.
<br><br>At this moment, she had long been scared silly.
<br><br>Even though she knew that Wu Tian would come long ago, but when she actually met face to face, she still couldn't help the trembling inside.
<br><br>Moreover, those people that Wu Tian had brought with him were all terrifyingly famous.
<br><br>They were all the top fighting forces of Wu Tian Empire, the important ministers of Wu Tian Empire, they didn't have a seat to sit, and she could actually sit down?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Finally, under Yi Feng's urging, Yuan Jing finally sat down apprehensively, her hands and feet had nowhere to rest.
<br><br>In the hall.
<br><br>Yi Feng and Wu Tian got acquainted and made small talk.
<br><br>After a simple small talk, Wu Tian said, "Sir, why don't we talk somewhere else, I have prepared some wine, and Chicken Little wants to toast you and big brother with two cups."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>Then he complied with Wu Tian's arrangement, and the group rushed towards the largest red building in Yuancheng.
<br><br>They then sat down at the largest private room.
<br><br>And because of her relationship with Yi Feng, Yuan Jing also had the honor to enter it.
<br><br>"Call the people in for me."
<br><br>After taking his seat, Wu Tian clapped his hands.
<br><br>Then the door of the room opened and a group of women who looked like heavenly immortals and had a dusty temperament walked in in a line.
<br><br>Seeing the situation.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei whistled and his movements brought up the wind.
