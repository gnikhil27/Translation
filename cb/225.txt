"Spare your life?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei said playfully, "Don't you quite like to play dead, why don't you let me help you make your dream come true?"
<br><br>"Wrong, wrong, wrong, I'm wrong, please, you wise, wise, monstrous, terrifying, handsome, majestic big brother, spare my life."
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede had a crying face and stammered in supplication.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Hearing this, Bones Ben Wei's head picked, and Ao Qing glanced at each other, and said leisurely, "Qing ah, really did not expect, and came across another understand demon!"
<br><br>Saying that, he brought his head closer to the Night Wind Centipede and asked leisurely, "Am I really that perfect?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, your perfection is engraved on your face, the first time I saw you I was impressed by your temperament, but I am a humble and timid little centipede, I do not dare to talk to you, but I always thought so in my heart ah!"
<br><br>"Oh open, since it is an understanding demon, then you go go go, I will not embarrass you!" Bone Ben Wei waved his hand and said atmospherically.
<br><br>Hearing that, the night wind centipede heart is very happy.
<br><br>But staggered just a few steps, but found himself not know where to go. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Several of the demon emperors he had followed had died, and without a backer, it would be difficult for him to survive as a small demon spirit.
<br><br>Can't help but, he turned around fiercely and said in a flattering manner, "Two brothers, how about letting the little one follow you, as a cow and a horse."
<br><br>"You little centipede, what's the use of following us, hurry up and go, if you don't go, don't blame me for changing my attention ha!" Skull Benevolent waved his hand impatiently and said.
<br><br>"Useful, I am useful ah!"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede hurriedly explained: "I see the two good brothers look like, is lack of money?"
<br><br>"Money is easy to solve ah, I know where there is, I can take you guys there ah!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Hearing this, a bone and a dog looked at each other, and immediately looked at the night wind centipede.
<br><br>"Is this true?"
<br><br>"It's true, I swear, and there are a lot of good treasures, I'm the best at this stuff." The Night Wind Centipede said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Good boy, I do not see, or a potential stock!"
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei swept away the previous disheveled color, a pat on the thigh stood up and said: "Good, as long as you can take us to get money, I let you follow me."
<br><br>"Okay, meet big brother."
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede crawled on the ground bowed, then looked at Ao Qing, and shouted: "See Brother Dog, and Brother Dog's temperament is also a moving presence, ah, worthy of the demon on the demon who followed Big Brother, the same for Big Brother in the future, but also ask Brother Dog to carry more ah."
<br><br>This sentence dog plus this meal praise, straight let the dog float.
<br><br>Originally he did not like this little centipede, but now it seems that this little centipede is really good ah!
<br><br>This.
<br><br>A bone, a dog, a centipede, a beat, towards the night wind centipede said the direction to rush.
<br><br>And the place to which it is headed, is in Pingjiang City sitting against the Shogun Mountain.
<br><br>The weather, more and more cold.
<br><br>It was already winter, the whole heaven and earth, a white blanket.
<br><br>"Master, I have practiced the three styles, what to practice next?" Zhong Qing wiped the sweat from his forehead and asked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Next, I'm afraid I'll have to take you to Shade Mountain for some experience and training." Yi Feng pondered slightly and made such an intention.
<br><br>He was not a cultivator and could only teach Zhong Qing martial arts, but even if he could only teach these, he begged to make sure to do his best.
<br><br>He also wanted to train Zhong Qing to be the best in kung fu.
<br><br>"Great master, when do we leave?" Zhong Qing asked excitedly, holding the big sword in his hand and excited to move.
<br><br>"Just tomorrow!" Yi Feng counted the time.
<br><br>"Okay master, I'll go and finish the work at home first, as well as the laundry for the past two days."
<br><br>Saying that, Zhong Qing left and began to work diligently.
<br><br>Looking at Zhong Qing's laborious appearance, Yi Feng sighed slightly.
<br><br>This child in addition to practicing kung fu, every day things are really too much, although Yi Feng will also help to do quite a few, but still in the heart can not bear.
<br><br>And they are some big men washing clothes and cooking, what is the matter.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>Martial arts school to find a woman.
<br><br>Wait to take Zhong Qing to the Shogun Mountain after the training, find a maid it!
