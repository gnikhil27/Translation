White Leader Sky returned to the White House.
<br><br>Two young men rushed to welcome them.
<br><br>One of them was graceful and uncommon, none other than Bai Yanchun, the grand duke of the Bai family.
<br><br>The other one was clutching bandages all over his body and limping with a cane, it was none other than Bai Qiqu, who had been kicked away by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Father."
<br><br>Seeing Bai Lingtian come back, despite the crutches, Bai Qiqu rushed to the front and shouted with excitement, "Father, how is it, did you help me catch that damned bastard, when you catch him, you must give him to me to dispose of ah, I want to break his legs and ruin his cultivation, so as to relieve my heart's hatred."
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>Bai Qiqu had a malicious look on his face, and had already planned in his heart how to punish Yi Feng.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was Bai Qiqu's fierce slap down.
<br><br>"Slap!"
<br><br>Heavy flung on Bai Qiqu's face, emitting a pleasant sound. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Why are you doing this, father?"
<br><br>Bai Qiqiu was dumbfounded by this slap, staring at Bai Qiqiu with unbelievable eyes.
<br><br>"How dare you ask why, I'll beat you to death, beat you to death."
<br><br>Bai Lingtian didn't care about Bai Qiqu's injuries in the slightest and lifted his thick palm, kicking him one after another on his body, causing him to scream.
<br><br>At this moment, he can be said to be as angry as he wants to be.
<br><br>If it were not for this damned rebellious son, how could he be so frightened today, and almost not come back from a trip to the ghost gate?
<br><br>Even his shadow, which has followed him for hundreds of years, was knocked out of his soul by a finger of Skeleton Benevolent, a grievance he had no place to say.
<br><br>"Brother, help me!"
<br><br>Bai Qiqu, who was already badly injured, was now beaten to death by Bai Lingtian, and put his palm in a deadly grip on Bai Yanchun.
<br><br>But in the face of Bai Qiqiu's plea for help, Bai Yanchun only kicked lightly with his palm.
<br><br>Not only did not care about him, even face flooded with a thick mockery.
<br><br>Waste is waste ah.
<br><br>The real matter of the family can not distinguish, really think that today father went out, is to help you revenge?
<br><br>The marriage between him and Yuan Jing, is the real matter that concerns the family.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>He is the true pride of the Bai family, the person who can lead the Bai family to glory.
<br><br>He, Bai Yanchun, has not even opened his mouth to ask questions, you a little bit of small fights, running to ask what to ask?
<br><br>You deserve to be beaten!
<br><br>Thinking of this, Bai Yanchun looked at Bai Lingtian inquiringly.
<br><br>Then asked indifferently, "Father, I wonder how the marriage between me and Yuan Jing is going today?"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was that Bai Lingtian then slapped him and said in a deep voice, "You shut your mouth too."
<br><br>Bai Yanchun's face instantly changed.
<br><br>Stunned in place.
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>What he was asking was an important matter concerning the family.
<br><br>Hadn't father always cared most about the marriage between him and Yuan Jing?
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>He could never have imagined that he, the proud son of the heavens, would also receive a slap like this.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that Bai Lingtian slapped him on the face with two more slaps.
<br><br>It knocked Bai Yanchun directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>At this moment, in Bai Lingtian's opinion, both were not in line.
<br><br>Yuan Jing?
<br><br>Now still dare to think about Yuan Jing.
<br><br>Do not want to live anymore?
<br><br>Do not see what kind of blessing people have received now?
<br><br>You still want to marry someone.
<br><br>Are you worthy?
<br><br>Is the Bai family worthy?
<br><br>"Don't ask so many questions, Yuan Jing you don't think about it, if you don't want to die, immediately pack your things and go to the imperial city with me!" Bai Lingtian said in a deep voice.
<br><br>Bai Yanchun opened his mouth.
<br><br>Although he had pride in his heart and was very upset by these three slaps, he also knew in his heart that something big must have happened.
<br><br>He then obeyed the command and hurriedly packed his things.
<br><br>Soon after, the father and son turned into two streams of light and rushed towards the Imperial City.
<br><br>A field of corpses was strewn with positions.
<br><br>Two armies were facing each other, with a total of hundreds of thousands of experts gathered here.
<br><br>The Wu Tian Empire and the neighboring Wind Language Empire had been tangled up here for half a year in order to fight over this place.
<br><br>Because this place has been a must for both countries since ancient times.
<br><br>At this moment, on the city tower of Wu Tian Empire's side, Wu Tian, who was dressed in battle robes, was listening to the report of White Leader Tian who was kneeling on the ground.
<br><br>"What did you say?"
<br><br>"You really, really found sir and my big brother?"
<br><br>After listening to the report from White Leader Tian, Wu Tian stood up with trembling body and looked at White Leader Tian excitedly.
<br><br>"Exactly, at this moment the two lords are in my Yuancheng." Bai Leading Tian said respectfully.
<br><br>"Sir, big brother, Little Chicken has finally found you."
<br><br>Wu Tian instantly had tears in his eyes and a choked voice came out of his throat.
<br><br>"You, the king of the country?"
<br><br>And many ministers next to see the king of the top heaven actually reveal this look, shocked mundane, have been scared to kneel on the ground.
<br><br>And Bai Yanchun, who followed Bai Lingtian here, was also stunned by this scene.
<br><br>What kind of person was it that could actually cause this kind of movement in the king of the country?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Wu Tian paid no attention to them.
<br><br>Instead, he tremblingly asked Bai Laitian, "By the way, do you know that you came to me this time, sir and my elder brother?"
<br><br>"Your Majesty, the two lords know, and it was sir who specially asked me to come." White Leader Tian said.
<br><br>"Oh, really?"
<br><br>Wu Tian asked excitedly, "Quickly tell me, what did sir say to you?"
<br><br>"Mister said that when he arrives at the king's place, the king, as the host, should treat him well!" White Leader Tian said, not daring to conceal the slightest.
<br><br>"Well, well, since sir said that, it means that he treats me as one of his own, hahaha." Wu Tian said excitedly, "Everyone listen to the order, follow me to go and meet with the gentleman."
<br><br>"At the same time, transfer all the First Saints of all the sects within the empire, all of them to me."
