Seeing the person who jumped to the front, a bunch of people next to him sighed in relief.
<br><br>"Great, senior brother is here!"
<br><br>"I've been looking for this kid, too." That senior brother looked at Yi Feng with a look of certainty.
<br><br>"With senior brother coming, we can definitely kill Yi Feng!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, senior brother is a Heavenly Immortal!"
<br><br>Once he heard it was a Heavenly Immortal, a look of scorn appeared in Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>He killed all the Earth Immortals.
<br><br>Heavenly Immortal, it was the first time he had faced one.
<br><br>"Hmph, this time, I'll see what else you can do!" That senior brother said, "I'm not afraid of your One Thought Finger!"
<br><br>The disciples next to him kept flattering.
<br><br>"Senior brother is a Heavenly Immortal! Killing him is like killing a chicken, senior brother, hurry up, get rid of him!" Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng took a step backward.
<br><br>Not good, it's a Heavenly Immortal!
<br><br>He pulled out his system while extending his finger.
<br><br>Kill a few Earth Immortals first, one more to count.
<br><br>After killing him, run! Then bring people to kill again ......
<br><br>That senior brother also laughed out loud and looked at Yi Feng arrogantly, "Today next year, is the anniversary of your death."
<br><br>"It's just a one thought finger, what's there to be afraid of." That senior brother said.
<br><br>The words fell, Yi Feng a finger fiercely towards a few Earth Immortal disciples next to him!
<br><br>The crowd was stunned, it was too late, only to see that senior brother's body side to side to block the past.
<br><br>"Don't be afraid, I'll block!"
<br><br>However the words just fell.
<br><br>"Bang!!!"
<br><br>A mass of flesh and blood exploded violently!
<br><br>Only to see that senior brother has exploded into a rain of blood, pieces fell ......
<br><br>The crowd was dumbfounded, and so was Yi Feng.
<br><br>Didn't it say Heavenly Immortal?
<br><br>Just this?
<br><br>"You you you ...... exactly what cultivation level!" Several disciples who reacted first were horrified and looked at Yi Feng with wide eyes.
<br><br>"Senior brother is a Heavenly Immortal Perfection!!!" He said in a trembling voice, looking at Yi Feng incredulously.
<br><br>"You lie, you lie, you're not an Earth Immortal at all ......" he muttered, frightened incoherent.
<br><br>Startled, and Yi Feng.
<br><br>He looked at his fingertips, and then looked at the people in front of him.
<br><br>A lift finger instantly all killed.
<br><br>Heavenly immortals? ......
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at a ground of corpses.
<br><br>Full of doubts.
<br><br>Heavenly immortal he can also raise his hand to kill?
<br><br>This cultivation, it can not just Earth Immortal ah ......
<br><br>To say that he is cultivation up it, but he did not feel any change in his body.
<br><br>But to say that the cultivation did not improve it, how can he easily kill a Heavenly Immortal?
<br><br>What is his own cultivation level?
<br><br>This whole whole thing, he himself do not know what his own cultivation to ......
<br><br>Ask the system, the pitiful system does not understand anything.
<br><br>Yi Feng went through the cultivation realm of the immortal world from inside his head.
<br><br>The most low-level human immortal, no obvious special place.
<br><br>The next is the Earth Immortal and Heavenly Immortal, also similar to the Human Immortal, after all, are called Pu Xian.
<br><br>Further up, there is the Golden Immortal, who can fly through the air in the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Xuan Xian, the attack can carry the power of thunder penalty, a turn a thunder tribulation, it is easy to distinguish.
<br><br>After the ninth Xuan Xian, is the reincarnation mirror, can break bones and rebirth, as long as there is a breath in, you can restore the body ......
<br><br>Further up, Yi Feng did not think any more.
<br><br>He thought of Xuan Xian attacks with the power of thunder penalty, but each of his own attacks also have no thunder penalty.
<br><br>As for a turn a thunder tribulation.
<br><br>He has not had any thunder tribulation.
<br><br>So their own Xuan Xian is unlikely.
<br><br>That under the Xuan Xian, the Golden Immortal ......
<br><br>Can fly through the air in the immortal world ......
<br><br>Just can kill the Heavenly Immortal consummation, although it is likely that they are also Heavenly Immortals, but also can boldly imagine that they have the possibility of being a Golden Immortal?
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng's mind moved and his feet picked up the force.
<br><br>Suddenly, he took off into the air!
<br><br>Yi Feng was stunned!
<br><br>He really flew up!
<br><br>So now it seems that he must be a Golden Immortal at any rate!
<br><br>Yi Feng burst out laughing.
<br><br>I didn't expect that he was a Golden Immortal!
<br><br>Damn, he hadn't flown once since he came to the Immortal Realm, and thought he couldn't fly!
<br><br>If you want to fly earlier and find out that you are such a powerful realm, you will still be afraid of the hell!
<br><br>Yi Feng flew in the middle of the forest for a while and was so happy!
<br><br>He was actually in the Golden Immortal realm!
<br><br>After a long time, Yi Feng stopped.
<br><br>"Good, then it's more than just killing all the Earth Immortals of Sun and Moon Peak. Hahahaha ......" Yi Feng rubbed his hands together cheerfully, happy that he was actually at the Golden Immortal realm.
<br><br>In this way, the sun and moon peak in addition to the three geniuses of the Heavenly Kingdom, they are not afraid!
<br><br>Then no one will be left behind!
<br><br>If he is so powerful, why should he be so proud?
<br><br>He is going to start to be high profile!
<br><br>He will start to rise!
