Wait.
<br><br>Just after shouting, the three demons suddenly found something wrong.
<br><br>Because what came, not only milk leopard Li a person.
<br><br>And the person who was with Milk Leopard Li was ......
<br><br>And when they saw what the person coming looked like, the three demons' eyes snapped open.
<br><br>Quack!
<br><br>Dry duck-like quacking sound came out from their mouths.
<br><br>They never expected that the one who came back together with Milk Leopard Li was that God-killing Bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>Immediately.
<br><br>The three demons' hearts sank to the bottom of the valley.
<br><br>It was cold and cold. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Now they suddenly remembered that they were the ones who sent Milk Leopard Li to the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Plain to take away the seven coyotes.
<br><br>And isn't this the Heaven-Devouring Demon Wolf Plain now?
<br><br>So, it must be that Milk Leopard Li had also been captured in the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Plain.
<br><br>But what surprised them was that although Milk Leopard Li was like an underling, she was not sealed and her cultivation level was still there.
<br><br>In this regard, Rhinoceros Lin was quick to think clearly about the reason.
<br><br>So he hurriedly said, "This child, Pao Li, has been resourceful since childhood, perhaps after being captured by that skeleton Ben Wei, she temporarily lowered her head and hibernated, so that after Skeleton Ben Wei and the others relaxed their vigilance, then sought the opportunity to escape."
<br><br>"Big brother is right."
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin also hastened to take up the fight: "It seems that Leopard Li is really much better than us, ah, all know how to hibernate, on the contrary, we are too stupid to end up in this situation now."
<br><br>"Big brother and second brother need not worry."
<br><br>The rhinoceros earth comforted: "Pao Li's hibernation also gives us the opportunity, as long as her cultivation is still there, she still has the opportunity to break the seal for us, then we can not turn around."
<br><br>"Third brother is right, we will cooperate with Pao Li next." Rhinoceros Lin said, "Just don't identify with Pao Li later, lest we let Bone Ben Wei seal Pao Li's cultivation because of us as well."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, as long as Pao Li hibernates, there will always be a chance to help us break the seal."
<br><br>"I just hope that Leopard Li can continue to hibernate and not reveal her horses."
<br><br>The three demons solemnly nodded their heads, their hearts foolishly excited.
<br><br>At the same time, they also gave Milk Leopard Li a wink.
<br><br>And when Milk Leopard Li saw the three demons, she also instantly understood what was going on.
<br><br>Because she had long heard from Bone Ben Wei and others that they had three demons that they were going to bring back to the back of the mountain, confined here.
<br><br>What she just didn't expect was that these three demons were their three great commanders.
<br><br>However, for Milk Leopard Li, this was not half worried, but rather a million times more excited.
<br><br>Because this is a good thing in her opinion ah.
<br><br>It's simply a great thing!
<br><br>She also wanted to ask the three demons to defect together, but now it seems that there is absolutely no need ah!
<br><br>The three leaders were even more unexpectedly given this great opportunity before she was, and put under the bones of Ben Wei.
<br><br>Just right.
<br><br>The four demons at this time, looked at each other.
<br><br>The thoughts were different.
<br><br>"It seems that Leopard Li has already comprehended our meaning, how clever!"
<br><br>The three demons of Rhino Forest couldn't help but sigh.
<br><br>"It seems that the three great commanders are also like me, thinking that following the side of Bone Ben Wei and that Yi Feng great power is a super great opportunity!"
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li couldn't help but sigh as well.
<br><br>Both sides, again, could not help but glance at each other.
<br><br>There was light in each other's eyes, and they nodded secretly.
<br><br>" Oh wang?"
<br><br>At this time, skeleton Ben Wei looked up into the distance and said leisurely, "I never thought that black feather was quite efficient."
<br><br>"Yeah, it seems to have brought a lot of it."
<br><br>Ao Qing also lifted his head and looked into the distance and agreed.
<br><br>"Come on, let's go over and take a look." Bone Ben Wei said, and then inclined his head to look at Milk Leopard Li, said: "You, watch them three guys, we go to go to come."
<br><br>After saying that, the four Bone Ben Wei brothers flew directly towards the sky.
<br><br>Seeing the four demons flying away Bone Ben Wei, the three rhinoceros Lin mood excited are about to jump out.
<br><br>Leopard Li is Leopard Li ah.
<br><br>Under the hibernation, so quickly gained the trust of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Great material too!
<br><br>This is not, their chance to turn over immediately came.
<br><br>Looking at the milk Leopard Li who was really watching the three of them from the side, Rhinoceros Lin couldn't help but shout, "Leopard Li, don't pretend, quickly, help us unseal and escape from that skeleton's poisonous hands!"
