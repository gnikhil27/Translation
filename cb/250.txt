Ao Qing gave her a white look.
<br><br>A man and a dog soon walked into the forest.
<br><br>"You wait here, I'll go find some dry firewood." Li Yihan squatted down, smiled at Ao Qing, and then walked towards the side.
<br><br>The dog was bored and lying on the ground, waiting for her.
<br><br>Soon, Li Yihan found a pile of dry firewood and sat down next to Ao Qing.
<br><br>Ao Qing, who was lying on the ground, looked up at her.
<br><br>"Mister has not yet washed up, there should be no hurry, can we sit here for a while?" Li Yihan asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>The dog put his head down again.
<br><br>"So humane."
<br><br>Li Yihan stroked Ao Qing and sat down on the ground and exhaled a breath.
<br><br>Last night's events were still fresh in her mind, and whenever she remembered the strength of these people, she felt a tremendous pressure in her heart, and she didn't even take a full breath. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>At this moment a short time away, finally let her whole person relaxed down.
<br><br>But she just breathed a sigh of relief, three streams of light swept in and landed not far away.
<br><br>"Li Yihan, this time see where you run."
<br><br>The three men looked at Li Yihan with cold intent, full of killing intent.
<br><br>"It's you guys again!"
<br><br>Li Yihan's face changed drastically and looked at the three people with a miserable white face, these three people were exactly the same forces as the previous Night Cold Twin Furies.
<br><br>Never thought that the previous Night Cold Twin Furies would be able to catch up to her not to mention that the people behind them had also caught up.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>"Humph, to tell you the truth, from the time you were hit by our first sword, your whereabouts were under our control."
<br><br>The leader of the man seems to see Li Yihan's doubts, said in a deep voice: "But what we did not expect is that the Night Cold Twin Furies actually fell into your hands, really underestimated you ah, so this time to ensure that nothing is wrong, only we can take action."
<br><br>"So today you can not escape ......"
<br><br>Li Yihan pretty face bloodless, full of reluctance.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>Facing these three people she has no chance of winning.
<br><br>Because these three people are Martial Emperor strength, she a small Martial King how can be a rival?
<br><br>She couldn't help it, her paws subconsciously backed up, her face gloomy at the same time, her heart was also thinking about countermeasures.
<br><br>But no matter how to think, in front of the absolute strength, all the schemes are vain.
<br><br>"Don't think about it Li Yihan."
<br><br>"No one can save you today."
<br><br>The three men were full of cold smiles as they forced their way towards Li Yihan.
<br><br>Li Yihan clenched her teeth and retreated in panic, her heart full of despair.
<br><br>But at this moment, an abrupt voice suddenly recalled.
<br><br>"Hey hey, three trash, who gave you the guts to be so arrogant?"
<br><br>Then under the jaw-dropping gaze of Li Yihan and those three, the dog lying on the side climbed up leisurely.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Li Yihan's heart snapped.
<br><br>It ......
<br><br>How can it talk, is it not a dog?
<br><br>But she just rose to this thought, a terrifying power from the dog's body burst out.
<br><br>Once this might came out, the surrounding trees were routed and fell down.
<br><br>And the presence of Li Yihan and the three were also collapsed backwards, struggling to support the situation, just barely able to hold themselves steady.
<br><br>Dog this cultivation aura out, Li Yihan red lips fiercely open, the heart set off a strong wave of shock.
<br><br>And the three people who were just complacent, their expressions also suddenly changed greatly.
<br><br>"Martial Zong?"
<br><br>"No, Martial Dignity ......"
<br><br>"Damn it seems to be more than that."
<br><br>"Run!"
<br><br>In Ao Qing's might, three people heart defense line collapsed, where still care about Li Yihan, swept the air to still run.
<br><br>Seeing this, the dog lightly glanced at them.
<br><br>A paw gently raised.
<br><br>Then gently put down again.
<br><br>Hoo.
<br><br>An illusory giant claw came out of thin air and blasted down towards those three.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhh!"
<br><br>Along with three miserable cries, the three people were directly slapped into meat cakes.
<br><br>A moment later.
<br><br>Calm finally returned to the surroundings.
<br><br>But Li Yihan, whose face was white, couldn't slow down for a long time, and his mouth breathed heavily.
<br><br>His expression was full of complexity and embarrassment.
<br><br>This group of people ......
<br><br>What kind of people are they!
<br><br>Is there still heavenly justice?
<br><br>Even a dog is so terrifying!
<br><br>In other words, she, a cultivator, could not even beat a dog in this group of so-called "mortals".
<br><br>"Do you want to continue sitting?"
<br><br>The dog gathered his momentum, glanced at her, and asked leisurely.
<br><br>"No, no, no more."
<br><br>Li Yihan hurriedly responded in a panic.
<br><br>She originally thought this was just an ordinary dog and wanted to take advantage of the fact that this dog was the only one around to breathe a little bit easier here.
<br><br>But look at the means this dog just revealed, but found that with him, also not at all easy ah.
<br><br>One man and one dog.
<br><br>Walking back.
<br><br>But on the way, Li Yihan could not calm down for a long time, there is no longer the sense of relaxation that came.
<br><br>And carefully glanced at the dog next to him, and remembered that it at any time to shoot the three Martial Emperor's appearance, the heart is shaking.
<br><br>But she still mustered up the courage to resist asking, "Before, senior, can conveniently ask, what exactly is your cultivation level?"
<br><br>"Demon Zun ...... or Demon Saint?"
<br><br>The dog walked while indifferent said, "It does not matter, it does not matter, because with the master, zun or saint, may be today, tomorrow is not."
<br><br>"What do you mean, it won't be?"
<br><br>Li Yihan drew a breath backwards, some can not believe his understanding.
