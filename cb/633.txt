Large dozens of disciples descended to the island and walked towards the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>Along the way.
<br><br>Various old men and women greeted them enthusiastically.
<br><br>After they had passed, a young man couldn't help but mutter, "Father, I thought that all of Sir's disciples were very powerful, although some of them did look unfathomable, but more of them didn't look very good!"
<br><br>"Look, there are also Heavenly Immortals among them, and mortals who can't see their cultivation at all."
<br><br>"This kind of person is how to be Mr. disciple, the island just take out a better than them!"
<br><br>"If I were a disciple of Mr., I don't know how much better than them."
<br><br>The youth said without poverty.
<br><br>"Pah!"
<br><br>His old man smacked him with a big ear.
<br><br>"Just you punk, just drink the island's water and eat the island's food to mix a hot chicken reincarnation immortal strength, where do you get the qualification to force to chatter?" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Do you know that any disciple of Mister is approved by some kind of heavenly dao law."
<br><br>"And that heavenly immortal you said, he is ranked thirty Zhen Qizhen, the reason he is still a heavenly immortal is because he is strict with himself, close to harsh, to promote the most perfect golden immortal, which is why he keeps himself stuck in the heavenly immortal realm, but even if he is only a heavenly immortal now, to get rid of ten thousand children and eight thousand garbage reincarnation mirrors like you, just like playing. "
<br><br>"As for the mortal you mentioned, his name is Bai Qi Yu."
<br><br>"He is indeed a mortal, indeed no cultivation, even can not fly, but his terror is completely expressed in another level, I estimate that his serious punch, the Sun Moon Immortal realm experts can not block."
<br><br>"And of course that Li Jin."
<br><br>"Since becoming a disciple of Mr., out sword has never hurt a person, but he is able to rely on the power of the law and make all the experts of the Star Immortal realm kneel down and call their father!"
<br><br>"In short, their realm performance is not their true power at all."
<br><br>Speaking of this, his old man took a deep breath.
<br><br>"If we talk about the most terrifying performance in this regard, it would have to be Lord Zhong Qing."
<br><br>"He is still a mortal in his realm."
<br><br>"But his three styles of slashing and chopping, I guess the Sun and Moon Immortal Realm can't catch a single style!"
<br><br>"So."
<br><br>"What do you know?"
<br><br>Said, a few more slaps on the youth's head, "Go home and face me for three years, so you can talk big!"
<br><br>Meanwhile.
<br><br>Yi Feng was sitting on the recliner at the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>The face is tangled and twisted.
<br><br>Because just now the system, as never before, sounded an alarm.
<br><br>And told him a hint.
<br><br>A hundred years later will usher in the great tribulation of heaven and earth!
<br><br>This catastrophe, even a realm like the Immortal World, will die ninety-nine percent of the people, no one will be able to survive alone.
<br><br>This hint.
<br><br>It instantly made Yi Feng explode.
<br><br>Originally he thought, engaged in construction, playing around to see the scenery, mixed with the fucking tens of millions of years.
<br><br>But now this thing came out.
<br><br>Completely broke his intention.
<br><br>Let was no longer entangled in the end what realm he is, and once again counted his fingers to count his realm.
<br><br>Golden Immortal, Xuan Immortal, First Turn Xuan Immortal, Second Turn Xuan Immortal ...... Reincarnation Immortal Realm, True Element Immortal Realm, Star Immortal Realm, Sun and Moon Immortal Realm ......
<br><br>What exactly is it?
<br><br>He scratched his head bitterly.
<br><br>He also does not know what realm is actually after the Sun and Moon Immortal Realm ah. With his current strength, he should not be invincible in the immortal realm, right?
<br><br>In the great tribulation of heaven and earth in a hundred years, he should fall, right?
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>Yi Feng was sitting up.
<br><br>"I want to raise my cultivation, I want to raise my strength."
<br><br>"Find a way to rise another fifty fucking levels in a hundred years, so as to be foolproof!"
<br><br>A brilliant light flashed in his eyes.
<br><br>At the same time, he contacted the system.
<br><br>"Please ask the system, how can I upgrade again."
<br><br>"Ding, upgrade with Qi Luck Points."
<br><br>"Qi luck points?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>He had read that upgrade indicator, 100,000 Qi luck points to upgrade one level, he was paid more than a thousand a month, 12,000 a year, it would take almost nine years to upgrade one level.
<br><br>One hundred years, at most, only able to ascend ten levels.
<br><br>"Please, is there any other way to get qi luck points, or can make the immortal river continent give me more qi luck points every month no?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked anxiously.
<br><br>"Answer to question one: the way to get qi luck points, the host himself or the host's disciples will get qi luck values if they achieve certain achievements."
<br><br>"Answer question two: the Immortal River Continent's qi luck points have reached the upper limit, but the host can obtain them through other realms, for example, the Immortal World is a higher realm than the Immortal River Continent, the same achievement will gain a thousand times more qi luck value than the Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>The voice coming from the system caused Yi Feng's eyes to light up slightly.
<br><br>He remembered that when he first let this group of disciples go out for training in the Immortal River Continent, this group of disciples had let him add a few points of qi luck value from time to time.
<br><br>Although only a few points.
<br><br>But he thought that after all, this group of disciples are too wasteful to break out of what achievements at best, I'm afraid that they have become the richest in a certain village, or become the king of the mountain where, or who planted the vegetables monopolized a vegetable market.
<br><br>And if.
<br><br>Move these disciples to the immortal world, and do not ask them to break out too big achievements, also with the immortal river continent, to which mountain when when the king of the mountain, when where the richest, or become the village head of which village, may also be a good way ah.
<br><br>After all, the system just said, the same achievement, the immortal world to obtain a thousand times the Qi luck than the immortal river continent.
<br><br>In other words, they were able to get him to add four or five points by being the king of the mountain in the Immortal River Continent, so wouldn't that be four or five thousand points when he gets to the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>He is close to a hundred disciples, which together would be four or five hundred thousand points.
<br><br>Four or five hundred thousand points, that can also let him rise four or five levels.
<br><br>And in case, this group of disciples have a few hard work points, mixed with a town mayor, may bring him the qi points can be multiplied many times.
<br><br>If and then the immortal river continent wages together, even if a hundred years to rise a hundred levels, but a 30 or 40 levels can still be.
<br><br>This should not fall in the future during the great tribulation.
<br><br>"I am really a talent ah!"
<br><br>The more Yi Feng thought about it is the more feasible.
<br><br>For the first time, he felt that this group of muddling disciples had some use.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>To complete this plan, there was one more thing that could not be ignored.
<br><br>That is the strength of this group of disciples.
<br><br>You know, they can be a mountain king or something in the Immortal River Continent, that's because the Immortal River Continent is a low level realm ah.
<br><br>And to the immortal world, the lowest level are human immortals, they a group of mortals run up, certainly not.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Still have to find a way to take the strength of their group of people, to enhance the human immortal.
<br><br>PS: I want to cheer cheer cheer cheer, and strive not to be waste ......
