"What are you doing?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piao Piao's pretty face changed and stopped in front of Yi Feng, sending a questioning voice towards the man who did it.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, please get out of the way, today I swear to take his life."
<br><br>The leader of the man angrily stared at Yi Feng, sent out a cold voice, to continue to make a move.
<br><br>Good thing.
<br><br>Once again, he was stopped by Bai Piaoqiao.
<br><br>"Protector Yun Lan, who are you to make a move against my friend? I need you to give me an explanation." Bai Piao Piao completely protected Yi Feng behind her, and that rosy pretty face was completely cold at this moment.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, you're confused!" Yun Lan shouted in a deep voice, "Have you ever thought about how he found this place?"
<br><br>"Humph, how did he find this place, shouldn't he ask you guys?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao sneered.
<br><br>Then he inclined his head to look at Yi Feng behind him and said softly, "Mr. Yi, please take a seat in the house first, I will solve this place and give you an explanation." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at these few men and agreed for the time being.
<br><br>He was not afraid of these few pussies.
<br><br>Just now when these pussies were ready to make a move, he used the system to detect a few, just a few trash, he did not take it to heart.
<br><br>But what he was afraid of was that in case this Yun Lan was Bai Piao Piao's man or whatever, he sent flowers to Bai Piao Piao in front of him, and he did understand that he wanted to fuck himself.
<br><br>So Yi Feng temporarily choose to retreat down.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Bai Piao Piao only faced Yun Lan coldly said: "Yun Guardian, at first it was you who claimed that the formation arranged no one could find here, could it be that the formation you arranged is this strength?"
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Yun Lan's face held an ugly look.
<br><br>At the beginning, he did say that this formation could not possibly be able to find this place unless it was the kind of existence that had become immortal.
<br><br>After all, after the formation was activated, there were illusions and traps all around, and only a specific way would be able to walk in.
<br><br>Who knows, the words just finished, was a mortal hit in the face.
<br><br>But his mother is even more angry, he himself can not find what is the problem, and can not give white floating explanation.
<br><br>"There is also no need to explain, I am quite grateful that your formation has loopholes, otherwise I am afraid that Mr. Yi will not be able to find me."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao said in a cold voice: "But, your formation is flawed, it is your problem, this is not a reason for you to impose the responsibility on Duke Yi, he is not wrong to come to me as my friend!"
<br><br>"Miss Bai, I admit that there might be some kind of flaw in our formation, but I didn't do it to him because of that!" Yun Lan said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Then why is that?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao asked in confusion.
<br><br>"It's because, it's because ......"
<br><br>Yun Lan looked at the flower petals in Bai Piao Piao's hand, was more and more angry, more and more angry, gritted his teeth and said, "It's because this son of a bitch destroyed the formation eye we worked so hard to set up as soon as he came!"
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao heard, also suddenly stunned, said incredulously: "When did he destroy the formation eye?"
<br><br>"Hmph, it's the flower in your hand."
<br><br>Yun Lan said without good humor.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao's eyes widened as she looked at the flower petals in her hand incredulously.
<br><br>This, is that formation eye?
<br><br>"This, misunderstanding, right?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao said with a speechless face, "Just now you also saw, Duke Yi picked it at random, not at all intentionally destroyed your formation eye."
<br><br>"How about ...... this flower and return it to you?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao handed the flower petals in his hand towards Yun Lan and asked carefully.
<br><br>Yun Lan face muscle twitch animal.
<br><br>Heart can not help but spit, have been picked, can still use a fart ah!
<br><br>"All right, for the sake of Miss Bai you, let's spare him once for now." Yun Lan said in a deep voice: "But in the future, please also ask Miss Bai to cooperate with us."
<br><br>"Then, thank you Protector Yun for your high hand."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly thanked him.
<br><br>After all, even as an Awakened One, she was not a match for Yun Lan right now.
<br><br>Yun Lan waved his hand at his subordinates and left with his hands by his side.
<br><br>But when he brushed past Bai Piao Piao, he saw Bai Piao Piao holding that flower again and started to smell it, he couldn't stand it anymore, he grabbed that flower petal from Bai Piao Piao's hand and threw it on the ground, crushed it fiercely with countless feet, and only then, under Bai Piao Piao Piao's dumbfounded gaze, he left with a lot of relief.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, how is it?"
<br><br>Seeing Bai Piao Piao back, Yi Feng hurriedly got up and asked.
<br><br>"Don't worry Mr. Yi, it's just a misunderstanding." Bai Piao Piao laughed: "But I have offended you."
<br><br>"No offense."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, remembered something and asked: "By the way, he ...... your man?"
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"How can he be my man!" Bai Piao Piao explained in a hurry, his voice hurried, "I have never been intimate with any man."
<br><br>"That's good, then."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>"Piao Piao has never touched a man, is it good for the gongzi?" Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes looked at Yi Feng and boldly asked.
<br><br>"Of course it's good." Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>"Then why?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao asked with a slightly expectant expression.
<br><br>"Good is right, not so much why." Yi Feng white floating a glance, at the same time the heart also relieved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately, it is not white floating man.
<br><br>Otherwise, if that Yun Lan dry him again, he is not good to say anything ah!
<br><br>After all, which man can endure, his own woman in front of others to be flower delivery?
<br><br>If you are not a man, then if that Yun Lan is pushing him again, he will not be polite.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao twinkled her beautiful eyes.
<br><br>Although did not chase out why from Yi Feng's mouth, but when Yi Feng said yes, her heart inexplicably some excitement.
<br><br>"How long does Gongzi plan to stay this time?" Bai Piaoqiao asked again.
<br><br>"I'm afraid I'll have to leave tomorrow at dawn, I have to go away this time." Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>"So? ......"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao look slightly dark, bit the shell teeth, raised his cheeks and asked softly: "Tonight, Piao Piao can talk with the gentleman all night long?"
<br><br>"Peopeo, still want to listen to the gentleman's heavenly voice ...... can?"
<br><br>"No can."
<br><br>Yi Feng said while finishing his things.
<br><br>Bai Peopeo's body trembled slightly, the residence ...... was actually rejected?
<br><br>However, it seems like it's not the first time that he has been rejected by him, right?
<br><br>"For, why?"
<br><br>She still couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Because I just said that I have to rush tomorrow." Yi Feng continued.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>She was just about to open her mouth, Yi Feng finished the quilt and then interrupted it, raised his head and smiled, "Miss Bai, the future is long, there will be opportunities later, well now I'm going to take a bath, can I trouble you to go out first?"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>White Peopeo exited the room with one step and three turns, Pretty Mei was full of worries.
<br><br>She could not say in her heart what kind of affection she had for Yi Feng.
<br><br>Is it a heartbeat?
<br><br>It does not seem to be so.
<br><br>Is it a confidant?
<br><br>Also like, but also seems not ......
<br><br>But no matter what, she understands in her heart, she will not appear in this place again, once her body power awakened, the two people can not have the opportunity to meet again.
<br><br>After all, then the two could not be a world of people.
<br><br>This is the reason why she boldly requested to have a long talk with Yi Feng all night.
<br><br>Because this goodbye.
<br><br>It's goodbye forever.
<br><br>But she was not able to say this out loud, and could only exit the room in a despondent manner.
