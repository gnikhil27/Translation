"Shoo Shoo ......"
<br><br>In the great competition.
<br><br>Facing seven or eight Sun Moon Peak disciples who came around, Yi Feng's one thought finger came out, and seven or eight people died instantly.
<br><br>Counting up.
<br><br>This is not sure how many Sun Moon Peak disciples died in Yi Feng's hands.
<br><br>At first.
<br><br>The hand to kill these people who killed him, but also let Yi Feng feel happy, and even blood boiling.
<br><br>But now.
<br><br>He is feeling less and less interesting.
<br><br>Looking at the ground of the flesh, there is no ripples.
<br><br>Suddenly thought. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>You and me, kill to kill, is the life he wants?
<br><br>This seems a little out of himself.
<br><br>Even let Yi Feng produce a strong and mysterious feeling, as if because of this period of time away from the essence of the reason, this world, there is something is gradually alienated from him.
<br><br>He stood at the top of the mountain peak, gazing at a group of Sun Moon Peak disciples that swept past in the distance, and did not choose to go after them.
<br><br>Instead, he chose to sit down.
<br><br>He didn't know why he sat down, but deep inside, there was a great force that prompted him to do so.
<br><br>It was as if someone was calling out.
<br><br>It was also as if this was how it was supposed to be.
<br><br>This feeling is mysterious and mysterious, so he can't say it, can't understand it ......
<br><br>As Yi Feng sat down, he slowly entered a mysterious state, his body seemed to be one with the world.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Slowly passed.
<br><br>I do not know how long has passed.
<br><br>Heaven and earth, it seems that because Yi Feng entered this state, a mysterious change has vaguely occurred.
<br><br>The great competition continued.
<br><br>It went on in an orderly manner.
<br><br>And Yi Feng's iron-blooded methods, with the passing of these days, also suddenly spread throughout the Sun Moon Peak disciples who participated in the Grand Competition.
<br><br>All the disciples hated Yi Feng to the bone, because among the disciples killed by Yi Feng, there were many brothers and sisters, friends and relatives of other disciples.
<br><br>But they also learned to be smart, after all, Yi Feng can kill so many people, the strength is certainly not as simple as it seems.
<br><br>So they no longer went to look for Yi Feng's trouble privately, but all of them organized themselves and planned to have a siege on Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Senior Brother Qi, Yi Feng's trail was found, right in front of the mountain peak."
<br><br>At the foot of the mountain, countless Sun Moon Peak disciples who heard the news rushed over.
<br><br>At the head of the group, was a young man in Chinese clothing.
<br><br>He was the disciple recognized as the strongest besides the three brothers of the Sun Moon Peak Heavenly Mansion, named Qi Tian.
<br><br>"So, do we do it now Senior Brother Qi?"
<br><br>The subordinate disciple asked.
<br><br>"There is no hurry."
<br><br>Qi Tian raised the corner of his mouth and said leisurely, "If my guess is good, the others in Star Peak have also received the news, right!"
<br><br>"Then let's wait for them, just in time to kill them all in one go!"
<br><br>"Ah, Senior Brother Qi, you are going to?" That subordinate disciple uttered in shock, "You want to wipe out all the Star Peak disciples?"
<br><br>"Not bad!"
<br><br>Qi Guang's eyes flashed, a sinister glint in his eyes.
<br><br>"If we kill one Yi Feng, the sect will not say anything even if they know about it, but if we wipe out all the Star Peak disciples, it will definitely provoke a real confrontation between the two peaks, and if the sect blames us, we will all be in trouble! The subordinate disciple said worriedly.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"You dare to disobey me?"
<br><br>Qi Tian grabbed his neck with one hand and lifted him up.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>That disciple stammered out and stared out, "Senior brother, I'm not trying to disobey senior brother, what I mean is, even if we want to wipe out the Star Peak disciples, shouldn't we wait for the three senior brothers Li Tian to arrive before we do it together."
<br><br>"Li Tian?"
<br><br>"Those three losers, what can they do if they come or not? Could it be that you think I'm not strong enough to completely annihilate the Star Peak disciples?"
<br><br>"This is the second time you question me!"
<br><br>An icy cold voice came out, and this disciple was directly crushed by Qi Tian and burst his neck.
<br><br>The corpse was thrown on the ground, which caused a commotion among the other disciples.
<br><br>"I said, I want to annihilate all the Star Peak disciples, do you guys have a problem with that?" Qi Tian asked leisurely as his cold light flashed.
<br><br>"No opinion no opinion ......"
<br><br>The others responded, not daring to question.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Qi Tian then nodded his head in satisfaction, cold light flickering in his eyes.
<br><br>This big competition.
<br><br>Getting a small ranking.
<br><br>What's the point?
<br><br>If you want to do it, you have to do it big, wipe out the Star Peak and blow up the whole sect in one fell swoop.
<br><br>As for the chastisement?
<br><br>In front of an absolute genius, he believed that the group of senior management could make a clear choice.
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>It will be the time for him, Qi Tian, to rise completely.
<br><br>The other direction.
<br><br>The Star Peak disciples led by Yang Yi also began to assemble.
<br><br>"Hurry over, the peak master has explained that he must ensure that senior brother Yi Feng is safe."
<br><br>On the way, Yang Yi solemnly explained.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The other disciples of Star Peak all nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Normally, they were used to being oppressed by Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>It was only since Yi Feng came that they raised their heads a bit, so no matter what they said, they couldn't let anything happen to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"However, we are not necessarily a match for Sun Moon Peak!" A disciple said worriedly.
<br><br>"Don't worry, as far as I know those three from the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom are not there, and we are not going to fight Sun Moon Peak to the death, we just need to take Senior Brother Yi Feng and evacuate." Yang Yi said.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The other disciples just relaxed a lot.
<br><br>After all, with the three from the Heavenly Kingdom not present, Yang Yi was still not afraid of anyone from Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>When they arrived at the mountain peak, they saw Yi Feng sitting on the mountain room from afar, with a faint aura released around him.
<br><br>"What is Senior Brother Yi Feng doing, what time is it, why is he still sitting here cross-legged?" A Star Peak disciple couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Don't worry, Senior Brother Yi Feng should be having an epiphany, let's wait for him here and protect him!"
<br><br>"When Senior Brother Yi Feng has finished his breakthrough, it's not too late for us to leave."
<br><br>Yang Yi said.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, a cold laugh came from not far away.
<br><br>"Go?"
<br><br>"It's hard to wait for you all to be together, and you still want to leave?"
<br><br>Qi Tian's cold voice came out, and in all directions, Sun and Moon Peak disciples came out and surrounded the Star Peak disciples.
<br><br>"What do you want?"
<br><br>Yang Yi frowned and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Of course, it's to wipe you all out."
<br><br>Qi Tian's expression was cold, seemingly not wanting to say one more word of nonsense, he directly attacked towards the Star Peak disciples.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>Several miserable screams came out, and several Star Peak disciples died instantly.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This scene immediately aroused the hatred of the Star Peak disciples.
<br><br>I thought Qi Tian was just saying some harsh words, but never thought that he would actually dare to do it.
<br><br>"Detach two Golden Immortal disciples to protect Senior Brother Yi Feng, the rest of you follow me to meet the enemy."
<br><br>Yang Yi struck out with a long sword in his hand.
<br><br>After all, the three from the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom are not present, and he is really not afraid of anyone present.
