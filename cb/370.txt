Just as his voice fell, Black Feather's fist attacked towards him.
<br><br>"Carving insects and small ......"
<br><br>A cold smile spread across his face, but just as the words were half spoken, he was surprised to find that the power of Black Feather's fist surpassed his perception.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>Yun Xiang's eyes widened at once, his face full of disbelief.
<br><br>How was it possible for this level of power to come out in Black Feather's hands?
<br><br>But at this moment, he could no longer afford to think too much, as this fist landed on his body in a devastating manner.
<br><br>"Moo!"
<br><br>Accompanied by the cloud elephant's miserable cry, the huge elephant body tumbled up in mid-air, and then burst like a balloon, turning into its original state and smashing down from mid-air.
<br><br>"Boom!" The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The huge body smashed down to the ground, smashing out a big pit and fainted.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The cloud elephant actually?"
<br><br>The other Immortal Realm demons also changed color at this moment, and unbelievable voices came out.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>Black Feather, however, emitted an arrogant sound with his arms crossed.
<br><br>Looking at his fist, full of excitement.
<br><br>This treasure.
<br><br>He bet on the right one.
<br><br>Otherwise, he was afraid that he would not be able to exert such a powerful force in this life.
<br><br>"Beloved Lord Bones, may I ask this kind of power, can I continue to use it?" He asked respectfully in a hurry.
<br><br>"Of course!"
<br><br>"The louder you shout, the louder the sound, the more powerful the power will be." Skeleton Benevolent said with his head held high.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, hahahaha, many thanks, many thanks to Lord Bones, then please ask Lord Bones to watch from the sidelines and see how I will solve this group of screaming ants."
<br><br>Black Feather once again laughed out loud and instantly felt like he was on the top of his life.
<br><br>Then his body swept out.
<br><br>At the same time, the sky echoed with the sound of "Bone Ben Wei is the most handsome".
<br><br>It is to see, usually by the demon crowd do not look up to the black feather, now transformed into a god of war, hit them like a wolf into a flock, a punch a.
<br><br>Soon, all of them will be smashed over, landed on the ground back to the origin state.
<br><br>"Dang!"
<br><br>"Buckle them up, follow us, and bring them back to the master!"
<br><br>Skeleton Benevolent threw a chain on the ground and instructed.
<br><br>Black Feather smiled and took the chain.
<br><br>Snapping a fainting demon beast onto it, he pulled the chain and hurried in the direction of the island.
<br><br>The next morning.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei and the others were already taking several demons from the Western Demon Forest, as well as the fainted Immortal Realm demons back beyond the island.
<br><br>This time, it was full of harvest.
<br><br>"Milk Leopard Li, since you have already defected, we do not expect anything from you, but for the sake of past love, you find an opportunity to release us, we even do not owe each other."
<br><br>The rhinoceros forest three demons see back to this island, face reluctant, look up at the milk leopard Li, voice transmission said.
<br><br>"The three commanders, forgive me for being unable to do so."
<br><br>With a straight face, Milk Leopard Li transmitted back her voice and advised, "Believe me, I am doing this for the good of the Western Demon Forest, and for the good of the three of you."
<br><br>"Humph, I really don't know what kind of enchantment you've been fed."
<br><br>Faced with Milk Leopard Li's persuasion, the three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest obviously scoffed and instead accused, "Even if they are strong, but what does it have to do with you?"
<br><br>"As for what you said about breaking the sky with one punch and creating immortals with your bare hands, it's simply a pipe dream."
<br><br>However, their voices had just fallen.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei suddenly took a step and walked in front of Milk Panther Li.
<br><br>"You little leopard have been doing well lately!" Bone Ben Wei looked at Milk Leopard Li appreciatively and said leisurely, "This scum will promote you once."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>A wave of the palm of the hand, the sky space ripped open.
<br><br>Immortal irrigation directly surged, enveloping Milk Leopard Li, directly allowing her strength to climb in the face of the three demons of the Western Demon Forest.
<br><br>Seven lives demon emperor ......
<br><br>Eight life demon emperor ......
<br><br>Nine lives demon emperor ......
<br><br>Finally directly into immortality!
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It directly made the three demons, who were just now full of disdain, petrified in place.
<br><br>Looking at each other's eyes, full of incredulity.
<br><br>This is?
<br><br>Creating an immortal with his bare hands?
<br><br>How is it possible?
<br><br>The three demons felt extremely unreal, rubbed their eyes to look carefully and found that Milk Leopard Li's aura was even more powerful than theirs.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Can you really fucking create immortals with your bare hands?
<br><br>Just when their brains, still in the skeleton Ben Wei means under the shock of slowing down ......
<br><br>In the distance, the pathway, suddenly there is movement again.
<br><br>A white robe leisurely walked to the edge of the lake, stretched, squinting at the distance.
<br><br>"It's a new day again, full of positive energy, pleasant good mood ah."
<br><br>"A new day, a new goal, Yi Feng cheer, Yi Feng is the best!"
<br><br>"Oh yeah."
<br><br>Along with the sound of a meta-energy-filled voice, an illusory fist shadow blasted into the sky.
