With a command, all the experts of the Xuanwu Sect descended from the mountain.
<br><br>"Master, I don't think it's good for us to fight down the mountain in such a hasty manner." After arriving at Pingjiang City, Demon Ling'er said with a worried face.
<br><br>"What's not good, such a great revenge, is it not revenge?" Ning Xuanwu said with a fierce face, "What's more, my two greatest treasures are still in that person's hands, should I just let it go?"
<br><br>"No Master, you have misunderstood." Demon Ling'er hurriedly explained, "Revenge must be avenged, and the two great treasures must be retrieved, but if we come to the door in such a raging manner, what if the other party is prepared?"
<br><br>"Dustless and windless brothers are a lesson from the past!"
<br><br>"In my opinion, it's better for us to think long term."
<br><br>On hearing this, Ning Xuanwu's brow furrowed, he was overwhelmed by hatred before, after being reminded by Demon Ling'er, it's really ah!
<br><br>"By the way, didn't you have contact with him?" Ning Xuanwu asked in a deep voice, "Then what exactly is his strength?"
<br><br>At those words, Demon Spirit's brow furrowed.
<br><br>There was even a flicker of gravity in her eyes, and she turned her solemn gaze towards Ning Xuanwu before saying, "Master, this is why I have to remind you to think long and hard."
<br><br>"His strength ......" 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Speaking of this, Demon Ling'er took a deep breath and said gruffly, "I can't see through it."
<br><br>"Impervious?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu could not help but lock his eyebrows.
<br><br>"Good, and not just the kind of simple impervious, but the kind that can not capture his breath in the slightest." Demon Ling'er recalled the time, said with a locked brow, "If I hadn't seen him with my own eyes using the Swift Cloak as a rag, knowing that the two senior brothers were killed in his hands, I'm afraid I would have thought he was a mortal."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's words made Ning Xuanwu's brow furrow even tighter.
<br><br>Thinking back now, he realized that he had overlooked a big problem.
<br><br>Since Windless Dustless was able to be easily beaten into dust by him, it meant that Yu Wujie that day was not lying, nor was it a smoke bomb put out by the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>This would mean that the terrifying sword in Lu Qingshan's hand could really have been built by this person.
<br><br>If this is really the case, he Xuanwu clan hitting the door has an effect?
<br><br>Would he, Ning Xuanwu, be this person's opponent?
<br><br>The answer is obvious, he built the knife can make Lu Qingshan chase him to kill 3,000 miles of chaos, that real strength, I'm afraid against the sky!
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu heart is guilty of muttering, can not help but beat a retreat.
<br><br>However, once he thought of his two disciples, a corpse is not survived, a bone are used to feed the dog, he could not swallow this grievance.
<br><br>"Then listen to my command, first send a dead soldier to poke around."
<br><br>Obviously, Ning Xuanwu is not a brainless person.
<br><br>After some deep consideration, he made such a decision.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Well, it's a comfortable day today!"
<br><br>In the courtyard, Yi Feng lying on a recliner, lazily sunning himself raising his eyes, so comfortable!
<br><br>"Master, the pavilion hygiene are cleaned, what else do you want to order." The martial arts school is the first time to get this kind of cleaning, Zhong Qing did the hard work for two days to get the hygiene done.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Zhong Qing with relief.
<br><br>This child, really obedient.
<br><br>"That rag fabric seems to be quite good, don't waste it, you put it outside the door to dry in the sun, save it for later to be able to continue to use." Yi Feng softly instructed.
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>"Oh, yes, the other day the weather is quite damp, the front hall of the eighteen paintings also take down the sun, but the paintings, or sun in the courtyard to come, in case the wind blows away is not good." Yi Feng also softly instructed, although these paintings look useless, selling is not worth a few money, but hang the hall as decorative items, decorate his martial arts school, but also good.
<br><br>Zhong Qing obediently obeyed the command.
<br><br>First, the eighteen paintings were taken down to the courtyard, and the walls where the paintings were hung were wiped with a rag before the rag was sun-dried to the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>At this time, several to figures flashed and came and landed in the dark.
<br><br>It was Ning Xuanwu and the crowd from the Xuanwu Sect, and beside them, they also carried a pale youth.
<br><br>Obviously, the youth was the dead soldier they had selected to spy on the martial school.
<br><br>"Don't worry, if you can't come back, your family and friends I will give the best treatment, and if you can come back, directly promote you to become a personal disciple, you can choose any one of all the elders to worship." Ning Xuanwu patted the youth's shoulder and instructed towards him.
<br><br>"Master, you see."
<br><br>However, just as he finished instructing, Demon Spirit's urgent voice came from the side.
<br><br>Following Demon Spirit's pointing, Ning Xuanwu instantly dropped his gaze to the entrance of the martial school and his face changed violently.
<br><br>There.
<br><br>There was a rag hanging.
<br><br>It was dirty and wrinkled and knotted.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Swift Cloak."
<br><br>As soon as he saw this scene, Ning Xuanwu exploded, despite having said it from Demon Spirit's mouth, he was burning with rage when he saw with his own eyes that his beloved treasure was being hung out there as a rag.
<br><br>Provocation.
<br><br>Barefaced provocation.
<br><br>It was simply too much to put people in the eye.
<br><br>"Son of a bitch, this daddy won't be a man until he kills you."
<br><br>In an instant, Ning Xuanwu burst out a monstrous aura, the palm of his foot chopped the ground, to kill towards the martial arts school.
