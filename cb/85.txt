"Passing through?"
<br><br>The black-robed man emitted an eerie voice.
<br><br>Pure and simple this voice, it scared the soul of Lu Dasheng, Martial Sect experts have easily died in the hands of this person, he a small Martial Emperor, in the hands of this person, is not with a small earthworm like?
<br><br>"Seniors seniors, I was really passing through." Lu Dasheng's body shivered and his legs went soft with fear, and he hurriedly explained, "By the way, I am the number one pill refiner in Nansha, I can refine royalty pills, as long as you need it, senior, I am willing to serve you, just please spare my life."
<br><br>"You think I would need an imperial grade medicine?"
<br><br>The black-robed man said grimly.
<br><br>At these words, Lu Dasheng's face was ugly to the extreme, originally thought that by virtue of his identity as the No. 1 pill refiner in Nansha, he could still make this person scare, but neglected to mention that the existence that can kill Martial Sects with his hands, how can he put the Imperial Pill in his eyes!
<br><br>"Slap yourself a hundred times, then get as far away as you can!"
<br><br>However, it seems that the black-robed man was not interested in Lu Dasheng at all, leisurely leaving a sentence, and then already disappeared.
<br><br>Seeing this, the just nervous Lu Dasheng suddenly sighed with relief.
<br><br>But the next instant, a voice appeared in his mind ...... first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"If you don't smoke, keep you worse than that person's death!"
<br><br>This sentence let Rudasheng like a lightning strike, the whole person bitterly held the face, standing in place full of regret.
<br><br>What the hell am I doing here? What kind of grudge is this, just run to see a hilarious, the results came across this crop, but the heart again unwilling, but remember the man's methods, he did not dare to bet ah!
<br><br>Then had to lift a heavy slap, to their own face smoked over.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak, who was chasing after Lu Dasheng, arrived only now and saw Lu Dasheng with his feet in the air, slapping himself.
<br><br>At the same time the mouth also counted, afraid of less than a draw.
<br><br>"Lu ...... Master Lu, what kind of sins have you suffered, why do you have to trample yourself so much?" The old ancestor of Qing Shan frowned and asked cautiously.
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng shouted violently and took his anger directly out on the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>The old ancestor saw a shiver and hurriedly left, and after a long distance turned around and saw Lu Dasheng slapping himself.
<br><br>"Maybe the family suffered some kind of change?"
<br><br>"Forget it, after all, we do not dare to say, nor dare to ask ah ......"
<br><br>shook his head, the old ancestor of the green mountain this face complicated to leave.
<br><br>Sleepy-eyed Yi Feng to this point only then woke up leisurely.
<br><br>Just ready to pour a glass of water to drink, found the yard that has been jumping skull head is missing.
<br><br>"Disciple, where is that shit?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked aloud.
<br><br>"Just, just now it was there, and then it disappeared." Zhong Qing said in a hurry.
<br><br>"This unconscious thing, ran out to cause me trouble again."
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was sunken and filled with anger.
<br><br>Damn, what he looks like do not have a little number, on that look to run out not to scare people to death is strange.
<br><br>"Don't practice, hurry up and go with me to find."
<br><br>Yi Feng hastily commanded, then hurriedly dressed and ran outside.
<br><br>On the street.
<br><br>Although it's late autumn, but the weather has improved a bit in recent days, so the streets are back to their usual lively, and there are even many people out deliberately purchasing the next winter supplies.
<br><br>Of course, as long as there is a street place, there is absolutely no shortage of women who love to shop.
<br><br>Not far from the rouge store, several small girls dressed in flowers, thighs exposed, wiping rouge at the same time, the mouth has a laugh.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>A black shadow Niko Niko Niko slipped over, low little head in those few little girls behind rubbing around.
<br><br>After rubbing for a long, long time, the black robe under the emergence of a small white head, upper and lower jaws click, click, click, through the color of excitement.
<br><br>Seeing no one around, a white palm silently came out from the sleeve of the big robe ......
<br><br>Then, towards the little girl's flap reached over.
<br><br>Seeing that it was about to get its way, suddenly a flying hairy leg appeared out of nowhere and kicked it in the head.
<br><br>"Frakking thing."
<br><br>"The unconscious thing, really give me trouble again!"
