"What?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words immediately made Wu Yonghong, whose face was shriveled, stare at Yi Feng with a face full of expectation.
<br><br>"Sir, you, you mean that my injury can still be cured?"
<br><br>A trembling voice came from Wu Yonghong, his body couldn't help but shake with excitement.
<br><br>"Of course you can, it's a little serious, but it's not to the point that it can't be cured, don't worry, it's no big deal." Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words instantly shocked the three people present.
<br><br>Dantian rupture, they have never heard of it can be repaired, even the Immortal River continent has a good saying, it is easy to raise the dead, but Dantian repair is more difficult than ascending to heaven.
<br><br>Yet in this one's mouth, it was no big deal?
<br><br>For a time, the three admired Yi Feng, especially his transcendent and calm appearance made them awe from the bottom of their hearts.
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng took off the bamboo basket behind him and took out a few herbs.
<br><br>Then the herbs kneaded together, "snap" on Wu Yonghong's belly, covering his wounds. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Okay, you can cover it with your own hands!"
<br><br>Lightly get done, Yi Feng continued to carry the bamboo basket.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>Does it work?
<br><br>Wu Yonghong dumbfounded to cover his stomach, a slight trace of doubt in his heart, not do not believe Yi Feng, just broken Dantian can really be these unintelligible herbs, to snap a cure?
<br><br>But the next moment, he then fiercely widened his eyes, his body trembled violently.
<br><br>The herbs were now emitting a warmth, which turned into a pure power and coalesced towards his broken dantian. In less than a few moments, his broken dantian had a tendency to be repaired.
<br><br>Looking at Wu Yonghong's appearance, Chu Mad Lion and Sun Zhuge on the side also showed amazement, to make Wu Yonghong show this appearance, obviously means that the medicine is working.
<br><br>"Really, in the repair?"
<br><br>The two men asked in unison.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>The two men looked at each other and instantly sucked in a breath of cold air, casting awe-struck gazes towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>This kind of tactics ......
<br><br>had never been seen before!
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>At this time, Wu Yonghong's legs directly knelt on the ground under the excitement, and said solemnly with a trembling voice: "Sir's kindness, Wu Yonghong will never forget it."
<br><br>"It's just a little thing, it's not a big deal, why are you so polite."
<br><br>Looking at Wu Yonghong kneeling on the ground, Yi Feng shook his head, the old man is probably dying himself, so excited.
<br><br>But Wu Yonghong was not willing to get up, a martial arts cultivator was abolished Dantian, simply more unpleasant than death, Yi Feng's move in his view, more significant than a life-saving gift.
<br><br>"Sir, last time you gave me a divine rake at a low price, and this time you have shown me such great kindness, I Wu Yonghong have nothing to repay, please take me as a servant, I am willing to go up to the sword mountain and down to the fire." Wu Yonghong trembling voice, head knocked on the ground said.
<br><br>"You are too polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng wanted to pull up Wu Yonghong, but just pulled up, he poofed down again, which made Yi Feng quite emotional.
<br><br>This otherworldly people ah, the gratitude is still quite good.
<br><br>Just a rake head and a herbal medicine, but actually so grateful.
<br><br>Looking at the kneeling Wu Yonghong, Yi Feng sighed and said, "So, how about this, in the future you help me do something, there is just a piece of barren land behind my martial arts school, I plan to reclaim him, just plant something."
<br><br>"Thank you, thank you sir, would like to die for you sir."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong was filled with hot tears, and only then did he get up excitedly.
<br><br>And Chu Mad Lion was happy for Wu Yonghong and at the same time, he was filled with jealousy.
<br><br>This Wu Yonghong can follow the gentleman, the future can get the benefit of inexhaustible ah!
<br><br>"Well, I'm going to continue into the mountains, you guys go back to Pingjiang City first!" After the courtesy, Yi Feng said in a soft voice, and continued to walk deeper with Xiao Zhulou on his back.
<br><br>"Sir, why don't we follow you in?" Wu Yonghong hurriedly said, "This way on the way, we can still pick up things for you or something."
<br><br>"Yes, yes!"
<br><br>The two Chu Mad Lions also looked their expectant eyes at Yi Feng.
<br><br>But Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>These three bad old men, a broken puddle can not climb up, and still want to follow him into the mountain?
<br><br>This damn is not for him to find a sin?
<br><br>In order to avoid their entanglement, Yi Feng said directly and nonchalantly: "Forget it, you guys should go back, you follow me is just a burden!"
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong three people rose red in the face.
<br><br>Although Wu Yonghong's cultivation was temporarily ruined, but Chu Wild Lion and Sun Zhuge were real Martial Arts experts, but in front of this person was treated as a burden.
<br><br>If someone else had said this, the three would have slapped each other, but in front of this one, they were embarrassed, or embarrassed.
<br><br>The reason is that in front of this person, their martial arts clan is really nothing, is indeed a burden.
<br><br>Yi Feng ignored them and slowly left with the bamboo basket on his back.
<br><br>Watching his back as he left, the three looked mesmerized for a moment.
<br><br>Out of the dust, off the mortal ......
<br><br>As if the world this world's wind and rain, are not into his eyes!
