Yuan Jing staggered her tongue.
<br><br>Dumbfounded.
<br><br>Although the heart is worried still, but Yi Feng speaks with that confidence, and that look that does not care about the Bai family in the slightest, is deeply attracted to her.
<br><br>However, after experiencing the matter of Bai Qi Drain, the two did not have the heart to hang out again.
<br><br>The two returned to the mansion.
<br><br>Yi Feng had no words all the way, black face, came back and went into the room.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>And seeing Yi Feng in this state, Yuan Jing sighed softly.
<br><br>"Big brother Yi doesn't seem to put the Bai family in his eyes, but in reality, his heart is still very gloomy!"
<br><br>In the room.
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed out. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Damn, when can I receive this last precious disciple!"
<br><br>This disciple of his has searched for several months, but still nothing.
<br><br>The most infuriating thing is that today he seems to have dropped money again.
<br><br>There were four gold coins that could not be found.
<br><br>Worry!
<br><br>Yi Feng first went through the whole room and then went through his own spatial ring.
<br><br>But the gold coins were not found, but a pile of garbage was found.
<br><br>This is previously placed inside the painting books and novels, such as "Taijiquan", "Dream of the Red Chamber" and so on.
<br><br>These junk in the past Yi Feng will think about selling money, but now he has long quit this business.
<br><br>He opened the door of his room, threw these books at the door, and said softly, "Miss Yuan, I'll take a break, please help me throw away this trash."
<br><br>"Yes, Brother Yi."
<br><br>Yuan Jing picked up those books, not daring to disturb Yi Feng anymore, and walked towards the courtyard.
<br><br>Outside the courtyard, the black-robed skeleton Ben Wei and the few dogs were lying on the threshold.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>In the distant sky, a group of white-clothed women stepped on swords and flew by, with pretty postures and figures, like fairies coming down to earth.
<br><br>The bored circus snapped up its head, and a light flashed in its eyes.
<br><br>Yuan Jing also perceived this scene.
<br><br>She looked up at the silhouette flying across the sky, couldn't help but sigh, her heart couldn't help but feel a trace of pity for Bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>I remember, when I was low in strength, when I saw the experts who could fly, how could I not look at them with such envy?
<br><br>So now she can appreciate the feelings of a few of the skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>She walked over and softly comforted, "Sir Bones need not worry, I believe you can always make your dreams come true one day."
<br><br>"Oh, really, can dreams really come true?" Bone Ben Wei asked with an excited voice.
<br><br>"Of course you can."
<br><br>Yuan Jing raised her little jade fist to motivate for Bone Burnett.
<br><br>But that was all she could do, seeing that Bone Ben Wei, with his short stature, really didn't seem to be cultivation material.
<br><br>She continued to walk towards the outside of the courtyard, but halfway there, she realized that it was a strange pity to throw these books away.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This is Yi Feng's stuff ah.
<br><br>He didn't want it, so it was good to keep it as a souvenir.
<br><br>So Yuan Jing privately put these books away and placed them on the bookshelf next to the hall.
<br><br>Yuan family.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Jing Yuan led someone to injure Bai Qiqu?"
<br><br>The Yuan family's head, who was also Yuan Jing's father, Yuen Long Tian, heard the news from his subordinates and slapped the tabletop, standing up violently.
<br><br>"Yes family head, this is the latest news I just received." Next to him, an elder said in a low voice.
<br><br>"How audacious."
<br><br>Yuen Long weather's face turned blue as he shouted in a deep voice, "Immediately order someone to call Yuan Jing back to me, I want to ask her what is going on."
<br><br>"Uh, family head, I sent someone to inform her long ago, she rebuffed me, saying that she has a guest there and it is not convenient for now." The elder said.
<br><br>"A guest?"
<br><br>"What kind of guest is actually more important than me telling her to go home?"
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I inquired, it seems to be an expert that Jing'er met on the way when she was transporting supplies last time, this person easily exterminated the five Black Witch Desolate Fish in the Black River." The elder explained, "It seems that the one who injured Duke Bai this time was also because of this person."
<br><br>"Hmph, nonsense."
<br><br>"Although it is indeed good to be able to exterminate the Black Witch Desolate Fish strength, but to offend the White Family because of him, is it worth it?"
<br><br>"Do you really think that after knowing such a person, you have the strength to make trouble with the family and resist the White Family?"
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian was seething with anger.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he still felt that he should go to the Bai family, express his sincerity, and at the same time discuss how this matter could be resolved.
<br><br>One should know that the matter of injuring the second son of the Bai Family was not trivial.
<br><br>After all, his Yuan family was able to survive safely in the Lingxu Realm thanks to the Bai family.
<br><br>"Get your things ready and come with me to the Bai family."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian got up and said.
<br><br>But as soon as his words left his mouth, another mid-spirited voice came from outside the door, "No need, I'll come by myself."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian's body trembled and he hurriedly greeted the door towards the outside.
<br><br>At the door, there were two people standing.
<br><br>One was tigerish and powerful, carrying his own aura of a superior.
<br><br>The other was dressed in black and exuded an icy cold aura, giving people a dangerous feeling.
<br><br>The leader was none other than the White Family head, White Leader Tian.
<br><br>The man in black next to him was Bai Lingtian's personal guard, strong and inseparable from Bai Lingtian, commonly known as the Shadow.
<br><br>"Greetings to the White Family Master and Lord Shadow."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian hurriedly greeted respectfully.
<br><br>"Let's go, take a trip to Jing'er's place with me!" White Leader Tian waved his hand and instructed, "By the way, meet the person you just said."
<br><br>"This ...... kind of person is not known, although he has some strength, but why is it necessary for you to personally go out."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian hurriedly said, "Why don't you and Lord Shadow wait here with me for a while, and I will go on a run and bring this person to you?"
<br><br>"If it's just this person, it's true that I don't need to make a personal trip. This trip is mainly to see Jing'er, and by the way, talk to her again about the marriage matter with Yan Chun!" White Leader Tian said indifferently.
<br><br>"Master Bai family has a heart."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian nodded gratefully.
<br><br>Yuan Jing possessed a physique, and to put it mildly, this physique was actually null and void, and did not gain much for her own cultivation.
<br><br>But it happened that Bai Yanchun, the eldest son of the White Collar Heaven, the eldest son of the White Family, was cultivating a technique that needed this kind of system.
<br><br>If you double rest with it, you will get twice the result with half the effort.
<br><br>And Bai Yanchun as the future first person of the White Family, so the marriage between him and Yuan Jing, naturally, is to make the White Leader Tian extra attentive.
<br><br>Otherwise.
<br><br>How can Yuan Jing climb this high branch of the Bai family.
<br><br>Even see, white collar day for white qi ditch was injured matter, and did not put on the heart, even injured white qi ditch Yi Feng also did not put on the eye.
<br><br>It is only when you are looking for Yuan Jing that you want to solve it by the way.
<br><br>The three of them, White Collar Sky, Yuen Long Sky and Shadow, rushed all the way towards Yuan Jing's private mansion.
