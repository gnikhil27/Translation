A thunderous voice came out of Wu Tian's mouth.
<br><br>At this moment, a golden light appeared in him.
<br><br>A huge aura emanated from his body and shot straight to the clouds.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"Genting Empire, unexpectedly, I, Wu Tian, can't die."
<br><br>"And not only can't die, you have also helped me unlock my hidden physique, the body of immortality."
<br><br>"And with this system, every time I die, I will be able to live, and every time I come back to life, my power will skyrocket ten times more than before!"
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>The wild and arrogant laughter spread across the sky.
<br><br>And the people of Wu Tian Empire who were worshipping, seeing Wu Tian rushing up to the sky, suddenly stared and knelt to the ground.
<br><br>"Wu Tian Guojun, fraudulent!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Shut up, the kingdom ruler is resurrected."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, looking at the shout of the king just now, it is obvious that the king has been resurrected, and he has been blessed by the disaster!"
<br><br>"Heaven bless my Wu Tian Empire."
<br><br>"We, the people, pay our respects to the kingdom ruler of Wu Tian!"
<br><br>"Long live my emperor long live long live ......"
<br><br>Tens of thousands of people kneeled down in the middle of the imperial tomb, filled with hot tears, trembling with excitement, and emitted frenzied voices towards Wu Tian in the sky.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"All the ministers are at ease."
<br><br>Wu Tian descended from the sky and with a wave of his palm, tens of thousands of people were lifted up directly by a soft force.
<br><br>"Go to me immediately, ask the best craftsmen to create a statue of my master in ten thousand times the scale, using my master as the prototype and gold and stone as the raw material."
<br><br>"After I bring down the Genting Empire, I will place this statue in the Imperial City of the Genting Empire for billions of people to worship!"
<br><br>After landing on the ground, Wu Tian directly conveyed his first order.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Gold stone for material, ten thousand times statue?"
<br><br>The crowd was incredulous as they heard the words.
<br><br>A minister of the court even couldn't help but step out and asked, "Lord ruler, that master of yours abandoned you in your crisis moment and made you almost perish, how can you return such a villain to him?"
<br><br>"You shut up."
<br><br>As soon as the minister's voice fell, Wu Tian directly slapped him on the ground and drank with a face full of anger, "How dare you question my master and speak ill of my master, you really don't want to live."
<br><br>"Someone, beat him down to Wu Tian's secret prison for me and wait for his punishment!"
<br><br>Wu Tian's words fell.
<br><br>The rest of the people were all silent, not daring to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"I know the rest of you have doubts in your minds, but I'll tell you the truth, this is all my master's arrangement!" Wu Tian shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The crowd was all confused.
<br><br>Obviously Wu Tian was in a critical situation, his so-called master ran away, how did it become a deliberate arrangement instead?
<br><br>"Humph, foolishness!"
<br><br>"Let me make it clear to you guys again, my master quasi knew that I have this immortality system."
<br><br>"That's why he arranged this good show."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Wu Tian looked at the sky with a look of admiration, sighing with emotion.
<br><br>"Now that I think back, Master hinted at me from the beginning and told me to fight the Genting Empire until I was immortal, and then suddenly left some time ago, obviously deliberately creating a near-death environment for me so that my immortal body could awaken."
<br><br>"If it wasn't for his master who planned such an arrangement, how could I have faced this near-death situation and thus awakened this system so quickly?"
<br><br>"Master his old man, really well intentioned!"
<br><br>Hearing Wu Tian's emotion, the crowd present also suddenly realized.
<br><br>After all, who in their right mind would put themselves to death?
<br><br>And Wu Tian would be even less likely to put himself at risk without knowing that he had this kind of physique.
<br><br>That's why that gentleman had designed such a game!
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"That gentleman is really a god-like figure!"
<br><br>"Planning and planning, calculating the sky."
<br><br>"This kind of great power is really my Wu Tian's lucky star, the world's lucky star."
<br><br>"Come to think of it, we really misjudged this gentleman before."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!"
<br><br>Various sounds of admiration came from the crowd that had suddenly realized, while shaking their heads in remorse.
<br><br>Because when Wu Tian died before, almost everyone was filled with a strong resentment towards this Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"When I first learned that my master had abandoned me, how could I not have wrongly blamed my master."
<br><br>Listening to the words of the crowd, Wu Tian also lowered his head with a face full of remorse, and his palm was even heavier in slapping a few big slaps on his face.
<br><br>"I, Wu Tian, a damned sinner."
<br><br>"Master was as kind to me as a mountain, I actually thought that at that time, I am not human at all."
<br><br>"I deserve to die, I deserve to die, I really deserve to die!"
<br><br>"So what do you say, to repay my master's kindness by building a statue for him?"
<br><br>Wu Tian questioned with tears in his eyes.
<br><br>"It should be built!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, it should be built."
<br><br>"Well said, I think not only this one statue should be built, but in addition to this statue, every city within the Wu Tian Empire should be built with a statue of the gentleman."
<br><br>"Yes, and also to write the gentleman into the textbooks for the education of the descendants of my Wu Tian Empire, so that the gentleman's name will be passed on to future generations and passed down for thousands of years, so that every descendant of my Wu Tian will know that there was once such a gentleman who had great kindness and virtue to my empire!"
<br><br>The crowd knelt down and worshipped, one by one, their faces sincere as they passed out their voices.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Wu Tian revealed a pleased smile and shouted, "In this matter, as you have said, all the cities and pools of my Wu Tian Empire shall build the statue of my master!"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>"Statue to statue, my master's previous decree also do not dare to forget!"
<br><br>"The only way I can face him again is to have some achievements."
<br><br>"So the Wu Tian Empire listen to my orders, all the troops, give me another attack on the Cloud Top Empire!"
