"Master, many people are gathered in the square, all coming to pay respect to the master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing walked in and said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly popped up, his face full of surprise, and was about to walk towards the outside when he noticed Zhong Qing who wanted to say something but stopped at the side.
<br><br>"Disciple, do you have something to say?" Yi Feng asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Master, what I want to ask is, are you a cultivator or not!" Zhong Qing said with a face full of expectation.
<br><br>"Heaven's secret cannot be revealed, you will know when the time comes."
<br><br>Yi Feng lovingly stroked Zhong Qing's little head.
<br><br>For this willing disciple, Yi Feng really couldn't bear to lie to him, but likewise didn't want to let him down.
<br><br>So for this issue, it is better to avoid for the time being.
<br><br>When you have received a hundred disciples, you can cultivate, then it is the best answer. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>A look at the head full of naive Zhong Qing, Yi Feng smiled, not to pay attention to him, and hurriedly towards the square.
<br><br>This does not go without knowing, a look at the shock.
<br><br>Under the leadership of these old men and women, the square was filled with people.
<br><br>If there are other people here, I'm afraid that the eyes will fall off.
<br><br>Because at this moment the square, in addition to those old men and women with obscure aura, young people without exception are the pride of the sky, and the lowest strength, but also has been the human immortal cultivation.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>They were able to reach the Human Immortal, not that they were demonic to such an extent.
<br><br>It was because the Immortal Irrigation of the Immortal River Continent some time ago had caused the cultivation levels of cultivators across the continent to rise.
<br><br>In addition to that, a great part of them enjoyed the dividends of their ancestors living in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>To even exaggerate, this group of heavenly pride was completely raised from the trash heap at the entrance of the former martial arts school.
<br><br>After all, for these descendants, a scrap of paper tattered in that garbage pile may be able to make them penetrate a lifetime.
<br><br>And it is such a group of heavenly pride, and see impervious to cultivation old man old woman, all respectfully standing in the square, face full of awe.
<br><br>Yi Feng roughly counted, these young people who came to worship the master is probably a large dozens.
<br><br>Yi Feng was overjoyed.
<br><br>This group of old men and women, simply instantly gave him the task of accepting disciples, to complete a large part of ah!
<br><br>And at this time, the sound of cursing and swearing came from the distance.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, although you barely got me to human immortal, but I'm so full of meat, it's hard enough to fight an eight life martial emperor, I'd better not go and make a fool of myself, right?" A fat person who was obese and looked enough like a small mountain reluctantly moved his feet, flashing his small eyes and saying with a face full of bitterness.
<br><br>"Chi a bucket, you hurry up and get over to me hear, do you know, how many people want to have this opportunity are not, you have this opportunity you still do not know to cherish!" The old man was so angry that he kicked the fat man in the ass.
<br><br>These few kicks were not painful at all with the fatty's fat, but he had to hold his head forward because of the old man's authority.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, sorry for being late, sir."
<br><br>The old man said with an apologetic face, which forcefully pulled the fat man into the crowd.
<br><br>But it did not occur to him that the rebellious son held out the pig's trotters again, lowering his head and gnawing on them secretly.
<br><br>"Eat eat eat, just know how to eat, disgrace my Chi family."
<br><br>"Old ancestor, but I'm really hungry!"
<br><br>"How dare you talk back."
<br><br>The old man knocked several chestnuts on Chi Yat Bucket, emitting a voice of hatred and disbelief.
<br><br>And the other young talents in the field looked at this fatty, more or less also showed some disdain, how such a person is also qualified to come to such a place.
<br><br>"Hehehe, you all have laughed at me."
<br><br>The old man smiled apologetically with his face, and secretly kicked Chi a bucket a few times fiercely.
<br><br>"No harm."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>As long as he could bring him his disciple, what's a little late, after all, this one more person, he will have one more progress ah.
<br><br>After waiting for a few moments, seeing that people have almost all arrived, Yi Feng began to accept disciples.
<br><br>After a glance around, directly picked just a barrel of Chi, who called this fatty both body and all aspects are so outstanding.
<br><br>"You come here."
<br><br>Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>The fatty who was gnawing on the pig's feet raised his head.
<br><br>The others also turned their incredulous eyes to Chi Yat Bucket.
<br><br>"What are you still standing there for, sir is calling you." The old man kicked his ass again on Chi Yi Bucket's buttocks, and hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Chi Yi Bucket then slowed down and hurriedly wiped off the oil on his mouth and respectfully ran to Yi Feng's front.
<br><br>"Ahem, let me check the talent ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng pretended to touch the fatty's shoulder and looked at his palm, his head gently nodding.
<br><br>In reality.
<br><br>Where would he look at any talent.
<br><br>But this is after all, in front of so many people, himself, the head of a family, at least the appearance must always pretend.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The system was used to give him a test.
<br><br>It is super trash talent.
<br><br>But talent garbage not garbage, Yi Feng does not matter, the key to be able to take disciples on the good.
<br><br>"En, the talent is average, but a little cultivation training is also a material that can be made." Yi Feng said a serious lie.
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>There was a gasp in the field.
<br><br>Countless people turned their envious eyes to Chi Yiqi.
<br><br>And Chi Yi Pail himself was also frozen in place.
<br><br>Of course, the most excited person was the old man of the Chi family.
<br><br>Originally, he himself is also by luck to mix to Pingjiang City, and his own descendants also really do not have outstanding gadgets, so he brought a bucket of Chi.
<br><br>He actually took a chance by bringing a bucket of Chi to him and never had any hope.
<br><br>But I did not expect that the first one was chosen by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, my Chi family is going to rise!"
<br><br>The old man of the Chi family laughed out loud on the spot, and even bowed towards Yi Feng one after another.
<br><br>Yi Feng awkwardly touched his forehead.
<br><br>A black line on his face.
<br><br>This is too much excitement, right?
<br><br>If this old man knows that he is an empty shell, may be what is the expression.
<br><br>But forget it.
<br><br>As long as he accepts a hundred disciples, his identity as a cultivator will be true to his name.
<br><br>He did not move and smiled.
<br><br>Continue to reveal the aura of the lord of a family, pretending to look around at the crowd.
<br><br>Under Yi Feng's gaze, one by one, the young talents, the pride of the sky stirred up and turned their hopeful eyes towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng was about to pick a random person to be the next disciple, the system's voice suddenly appeared in his mind.
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"Detected that the host's newly accepted disciple is not qualified enough, the mission progress remains at 3/100."
<br><br>"What the hell?"
<br><br>Hearing this familiar voice, Yi Feng was suddenly dumbfounded.
<br><br>"What, accepting disciples still requires qualifications?" Yi Feng's mind couldn't help but ask towards the system.
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"Minimum talent requirement for accepting disciples: ordinary qualification."
<br><br>"Ordinary qualifications?"
<br><br>Yi Feng flashed his eyes and let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately.
<br><br>It was only ordinary qualifications.
<br><br>It was no big deal.
<br><br>After all, his little waste disciple Zhong Qing also had an ordinary, so there was always a large portion of ordinary qualifications within these large dozens of people in front of him, right?
<br><br>"Activate talent detection."
<br><br>"Detect everyone present."
<br><br>Yi Feng sent out a voice towards the system, and then raised the corners of his mouth to wait for the results.
