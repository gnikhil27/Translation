The two men held their hearts and pumped for a while.
<br><br>Just about tears falling down.
<br><br>It was hard to make up for the loss of qi because of the Yellow Sky Beast, and now because of a Wu Tian, directly back to the prototype.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>The two men were furious.
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>Just at this moment, a subordinate hurriedly came to report.
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler who was in a fit of anger drank.
<br><br>"Wu Tian, the Wu Tian Empire has launched an attack on my Genting Empire and has already taken down three cities on my Genting border today!" The subordinate said hurriedly.
<br><br>"What?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler's anger climbed to the extreme, and his body was burning with rage.
<br><br>It was also not expected.
<br><br>This little Wu Tian had not only killed the messenger he sent, but also dared to openly declare war on his Genting Kingdom Monarch.
<br><br>"Wu Tian, good for you Wu Tian, a small empire's ruler, how dare you offend your superiors, I will make you die!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch clenched his hand in a fist, and a hoarse voice came out of his throat.
<br><br>"I'll take a trip!"
<br><br>On the side, the same angry voice came out from Exterminate.
<br><br>Originally, taking in the king of a subordinate country was a nail in the coffin, but now that such a change had occurred, he was completely unable to sit still.
<br><br>"Yes, this person must die!"
<br><br>"Even though we can no longer pull him in to become our man and increase our Qi luck for the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, killing him will at least be able to make up for the Qi luck we lost!"
<br><br>A firm voice came from the Genting Kingdom Monarch, his heart was already treating Wu Tian as a dead man.
<br><br>Perdition nodded.
<br><br>Then a red robe swept out quickly and disappeared as a red light vanish.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, as the host's outer disciple broke out into fame, awarding the host two points of Qi luck value."
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"A storm of Qi luck value has occurred, doubling the award of four points of Qi luck value."
<br><br>"The current host has a total qi luck value of six points."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was drowsy, heard the voice in his head and sat up unexpectedly.
<br><br>"Getting another four points of Qi luck value, seconds!"
<br><br>"Although it is still far from redeeming the divine beast in the system store, but it can be accumulated into more ah!"
<br><br>"But who is the outer disciple again?"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>"Seems to be the little chicken?"
<br><br>A confused Yi Feng scratched his head before he suddenly remembered who it was.
<br><br>"But this guy Chicken Little, a mountain thief plus pimp, can break into what kind of fame it ......"
<br><br>"It will not be which village robbed it?"
<br><br>The corner of Yi Feng's mouth could not help but twitch.
<br><br>But there is nothing you can do.
<br><br>People are now grown up after all, he, the master can not control ah.
<br><br>Got up and stretched, is also ready to go outside to find some food, by the way, take a chance to see if you can find an ordinary disciple.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When he came to the street, he found that it had become different from before.
<br><br>Banners and slogans were posted all over the streets.
<br><br>There was a draft for soldiers, a draft for food, and even more terrifying Martial Spirit experts flying overhead from time to time.
<br><br>All the grass is full of soldiers.
<br><br>A gloomy atmosphere filled the air everywhere.
<br><br>"What's going on here?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of confusion.
<br><br>After inquiring around, he found out that the country he was in had fucked with another country.
<br><br>It was a super empire that was doing it on the other side.
<br><br>"Grass ah!"
<br><br>"This country's king is not a brain pit, the bullet big country, actually dare to attack such a big hegemon, do not want to live?"
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng things also do not care to eat, ran back to the house and shouted: "Bones Ben Wei, hurry to me to pack things to run away."
<br><br>After hastily packing things, and Yuan Jing hurriedly said hello, Yi Feng took Bone Ben Wei a few quickly bailed out.
<br><br>Yuan Jing looked at the back of Yi Feng and the others leaving, tears slipping down from her beautiful eyes.
<br><br>He.
<br><br>Living here for so long, there is not a trace of emotion?
<br><br>When he left, he didn't even turn his head back, not even a single extra word?
<br><br>"Alas, daughter, ah, forget it, you are not at all the same way."
<br><br>At this time, Yuen Long Tian stepped out from behind and softly comforted, "This level of existence, we are not even qualified to climb high, forget about him ......"
<br><br>"Father, I know."
<br><br>Yuan Jing forced a smile to dry her tears, pretending to be strong and nodding.
<br><br>Eyes, however, always looked at the direction where Yi Feng and the others left.
<br><br>Until.
<br><br>Disappeared.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>"Another city down!"
<br><br>In the city tower, Wu Tian, dressed in battle robes, looked at a city that he had just defeated, and a loud and cheerful laugh came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"The king of the country."
<br><br>At this time, a courtier came up.
<br><br>Halfway through speaking, he was interrupted by Wu Tian.
<br><br>"Don't call my country's ruler, I am no longer the king now, if you want to call it, you have to wait until I bring down the Genting Empire!" Wu Tian said boldly.
<br><br>"Yes, my lord!"
<br><br>The courtier lowered his head and said rather worriedly, "Are we making a bit too much fanfare this time?"
<br><br>"Although we took down several cities of the Genting Empire in a row, but that was because the Genting Empire did not react, now that we have fought to such a point of no return, we have no back way at all, should we leave a way back for ourselves?"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"What retreat do you want?"
<br><br>"One look at your pattern is low."
<br><br>"Besides, what am I afraid of, my master and my big brother are sitting at the back to back me up." Wu Tian said without the slightest fear.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>This courtier froze.
<br><br>Then the worry on his face also quickly dissipated.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>That gentleman and those few Daxians were sitting in the back, so what else were they worried about.
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>Just then, the scouts hurriedly came to report.
<br><br>"Speak."
<br><br>Wu Tian waved his hand and said.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, according to the report from the spies planted in the Genting Empire, the Genting Empire has set its eyes on you, and a super expert for Extermination has arrived, saying that he wants to take your life, please decide."
<br><br>"In addition, this is the news about that world exterminator from the secret agent!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Wu Tian hurriedly took the news about the exterminator.
<br><br>"Strength is unknown, equal to the Genting king ......"
<br><br>Wu Tian's mouth murmured, and his eyes flickered slightly.
<br><br>These two bits of information alone.
<br><br>It was able to prove that the incoming enemy, was not something he could deal with.
<br><br>The Genting Empire's movements, really fast!
<br><br>However, he did not worry too much, instead his face was still full of energy, and he directly tore up the information of the extermination.
<br><br>Then raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>Murmured out.
<br><br>"It seems that I'll have to ask my master or my big brother to step in!"
