"Go to hell!"
<br><br>A cold light flashed in Ye Bei's eyes as the attack in his hands came closer and closer.
<br><br>In his opinion, the Martial Emperor's full power strike containing internal energy was bound to cut this arrogant and arrogant, while pretending to be a god, Yi Feng in front of him under his palm.
<br><br>"Fancy!"
<br><br>However, Yi Feng merely glanced at him and said disdainfully.
<br><br>Right now, this white-robed youth's aura looked mighty, but in his eyes it looked simply flawed, and he couldn't even beat his disciple, Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Pop!"
<br><br>When the attack was about to land on Lin Feng's chest, Lin Feng dodged his attack with a slight side-step, and at the same time slapped him, lightly, on the face.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ye Bei, who was originally full of coldness, was dumbfounded by this slap, and the next moment he was slapped on the ground by the heavy force.
<br><br>How is it possible! First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Even after landing on the ground, Ye Bei still looked full of disbelief.
<br><br>He was proud of the full force of the attack, so easily cracked? Even spare his Martial Emperor's strength, were not able to see clearly how the crack.
<br><br>However, the hot pain on his face made him feel humiliated.
<br><br>He, Ye Bei, had been a genius from birth, stepped into Martial Emperor at the age of thirty, and could be said to be the youngest Martial Emperor in the entire Nansha, and had never been humiliated like this before.
<br><br>"You deserve to die!"
<br><br>He said with scarlet eyes, and as he spoke, the Martial Emperor's cultivation flowed within his wide meridians, accompanied by his powerful aura, which was about to burst out instantly.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>A spinach basket smashed him on his head, and smashed him on the ground again, his body's aura and Martial Emperor's cultivation, were hardened by this spinach basket.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Under the backward flow of power, Ye Bei's meridians were flocculated, and a mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth.
<br><br>"Just this crappy strength, you can't even beat the cattle dealer next door to me, who gave you the guts to come to my place to kick the door?" Yi Feng said condescendingly, carrying a spinach basket.
<br><br>"You ...... you deserve to die!"
<br><br>This humiliating voice fell in Ye Bei's ears, making him feel doubly humiliated, his body trembling, not even bothering to get up, his palm moved, a transparent treasure bead was sacrificed by him.
<br><br>"Heavenly Soul Pearl, give me to kill!"
<br><br>Ye Bei's eyes flickered with a strong killing spirit as he directly sacrificed the Heavenly Soul Pearl and impacted towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>This was his absolute killing move!
<br><br>And this Heavenly Soul Pearl was an incomparable clan treasure, he didn't believe that he couldn't kill Yi Feng.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng went down with one foot.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Ye Bei, who had a face filled with killing intent, shuddered and stared at Yi Feng's palm with a jealous eye.
<br><br>Heavenly Soul Pearl.
<br><br>A Zong item treasure.
<br><br>It was crushed with just one foot?
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Ye Bei felt a fish thorn stuck in his throat.
<br><br>"Just such a broken bead also want to kill, are you fucking brain-dead?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made Ye Bei hold his face even more ugly.
<br><br>Zong Pin's treasure, in he actually is broken beads?
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's cold as well as truly disdainful expression, Ye Bei suddenly understood something.
<br><br>It turned out that this person was not at all what he thought, but as Lu Qingshan thought, was a truly supreme person.
<br><br>Thud!
<br><br>Once he thought of this, Ye Bei's heart sank to the bottom.
<br><br>His intestines instantly turned blue with regret.
<br><br>It turned out that he, kicked such an iron plate, he wanted to run for his life, but before he could get up, Yi Feng's kick save landed violently at his chest.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>This kick shattered all the ribs in Ye Bei's chest, and the intense pain made him unable to speak.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng did not intend to let him go.
<br><br>This pussy, although dish, but does not let him off because he dish, after all, he came here to kick, this is considered a life and death enemy.
<br><br>Kind-hearted?
<br><br>Impossible.
<br><br>Kill chicken Yi Feng indeed not too dare, but kill, this is after all the other world, he also sneak to kill a few.
