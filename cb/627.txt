"Are you sure this is the right island?"
<br><br>One of the men looked in amazement.
<br><br>"It's like this my lord, Lord Emissary said that this is the only place that isolates him from tracing."
<br><br>Exterminator said respectfully, "And such a low level realm as the Immortal River Continent, under normal circumstances, it is impossible to evade Lord Emissary's tracing. So this place is highly suspect!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Such a small island can be destroyed with a wave of the hand."
<br><br>"Why do we need our ten brothers to personally take action?"
<br><br>A disdainful voice came from one of the armored men.
<br><br>"Old Ten, don't be impulsive."
<br><br>The man in the lead said in a deep voice: "The fact that this place was able to avoid the messenger's tracing means that there must be something fishy in it, so it's better to be careful."
<br><br>"Big brother is right, since the messenger wants us ten brothers to come together, he must have his reasons, so I suggest, first send a few people in to poke around!" Another man in armor said. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>"Old eight, old nine, old ten, you three take a trip!" The leader of the man instructed, "Remember, do not make any rash moves until you find out what's going on!"
<br><br>"Yes, big brother."
<br><br>The three men heard the words and immediately flew towards the island.
<br><br>And at the edge of the lake.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng, who had finished picking the dung with his ten disciples, was washing the dung bucket by the lake.
<br><br>"Remember my words."
<br><br>"For a sword practitioner, his sword is his life, the sword is in the person, the sword is lost and the person dies!"
<br><br>"And for the alchemist, the alchemy furnace is his life, the furnace is in, the reputation is in!"
<br><br>"And for us, the dung bucket is our life, we should love it, take care of it, give it the most exquisite maintenance!"
<br><br>"So brushing the dung bucket is also a discipline of learning."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng picked up his own dung bucket, personally demonstrated, while teaching in a serious tone.
<br><br>"The talk of a flush two wash three wipe, inside and outside the cycle of five times, brush it shiny, then polished and waxed, so it is barely qualified."
<br><br>"Only then will it identify with you and produce some kind of contractual association with you, so that you can possibly comprehend the Avenue of Dung."
<br><br>"Maybe if I say this much, you guys still don't understand, but if you reach my level, you will understand what I'm saying."
<br><br>"And as long as you do what I say and perform well, when you have the chance later, I will go to the gentleman and one of you will apply for a new pair of dung buckets."
<br><br>"Remember."
<br><br>"Dungers, invincible!"
<br><br>Rudrasheng puffed up his fist.
<br><br>"Dunger, invincible!"
<br><br>"Hoo-ha!"
<br><br>The ten disciples inspired out, especially when they heard Rudasheng say that he would apply for new dung buckets for them in the future at Sir, their faces broke out in smiles.
<br><br>And that's when.
<br><br>The three big armoured men landed in the woods not far from the lake and slowly approached towards the island.
<br><br>"Eight brother nine brother, you say big brother is really, is not just a broken island, fight over it is not finished?"
<br><br>Old ten complaining voice came out.
<br><br>He was a bit reluctant to come down to such a shitty place, and now he had to be tied up, he was even more dissatisfied.
<br><br>"Alas, old ten you say two words less."
<br><br>"It's not like you don't know how much the Lord Emissary values the Immortal River Continent, this Immortal River Continent is a low level realm nowadays, but in the ancient times, it was enough to be compared to the Immortal World."
<br><br>"So the qi here is especially critical for the higher ups."
<br><br>"This person dares to get involved in the battle of qi luck, which means that the origin is not small and should not be underestimated." Old Eight said comfortingly from the side.
<br><br>"Yes old ten, condescend to condescend, wait to find out the situation of this island first, do whatever you want!" Old Nine also comforted.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Old Ten coldly snorted and had to give up for the time being.
<br><br>Just then, an extremely pungent fecal stench came to the nose.
<br><br>This immediately stinks the three faces straight discoloration.
<br><br>Take a look.
<br><br>Found that the stench is a dozen neatly placed in front of the dung barrels out.
<br><br>"Damn, it's okay to come to such a shitty place, but also have to smell this stench, really bad luck!"
<br><br>The already very depressed old ten can't stand it anymore, cursing out, a foot will be one of the buckets of dung to fly away.
<br><br>Look at the flying bucket of dung.
<br><br>The old ten is relieved a lot.
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>He found the temperature of the surrounding air cold down.
<br><br>Let people's bones creepy, shivering chills.
<br><br>The strange atmosphere, making space to freeze, so that the three of them have a deep mire, inch by inch difficult to move the feeling.
<br><br>Then they saw the angry Rudasheng with a sullen face, flashing a pair of scarlet eyes staring deadly at them.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This is the dung bucket that was given to me by Mr. himself at the beginning."
<br><br>"I carefully wipe it every day, fearing that there is the slightest bit of poor maintenance, but you ...... but you kicked it away ......"
<br><br>"Death!"
<br><br>"I want you to die!"
<br><br>A violent roar, Rudasheng angry hair.
<br><br>"Bucket come!"
<br><br>He raised his palm.
<br><br>Nine shining golden buckets of dung appeared with a bang, swirling around him continuously.
<br><br>Another hand palm closed.
<br><br>Arcane hand seals were performed, faster and faster, and finally became phantoms.
<br><br>When the last hand seal fell, his eyes fiercely glared.
<br><br>"Dung Transport, Dung Nine Dragons Bomb!"
<br><br>An explosive cry came out from his mouth, and the nine dung buckets next to him shone brightly, and the strong fluctuations could not be suppressed.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>There was power rushing up from the dung buckets.
<br><br>Then it was seen, nine huge dragons formed by the dung water condensation, from the dung bucket rushed up to the sky.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>The nine dragons let out a deafening sound.
<br><br>It shook the sky.
