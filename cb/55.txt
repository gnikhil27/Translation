Wu Yonghong had some nervousness in his heart.
<br><br>There was also some anticipation.
<br><br>After all, it was the first time he entered Yi Feng's cave, so he was also curious about what was inside.
<br><br>But just came to the door, seems to step on something sensed, Wu Yonghong's body will shake violently.
<br><br>Then looked down.
<br><br>Fiercely opened his eyes wide.
<br><br>Next to him, a few old men accompanying the situation, will not think of the gaze over, is not a broken stone, there is nothing to see ......
<br><br>Hmm?
<br><br>When looking clearly, several people body stunned.
<br><br>One mouth open, eyes flashing full of unbelievable color.
<br><br>The stone under the feet of Wu Yonghong, seems to be the Zhentian stone? First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And look at the placement here, seems to be used only to fill the steps?
<br><br>The four people looked at each other and immediately drew a breath of cold air, using the Heaven-shattering stone to fill the steps, what a big deal!
<br><br>Although they did not lack such treasures in their hands, the Heaven-shattering Stone was at least an imperial treasure, and they usually kept it carefully, and even used it as a base card.
<br><br>However, this person, but used to fill the steps.
<br><br>When the four people were shocked, the abacus old man inadvertently saw something else, and his heart suddenly thumped.
<br><br>When the others saw this, they were also busy casting their eyes over.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Several people, their eyes almost fell off.
<br><br>It was another imperial-grade treasure.
<br><br>Swift Cloak!
<br><br>Just, why is this Swift Cloak so wretched and so dirty, just hanging there ......
<br><br>Seeing these old men slow, Yi Feng, who was walking ahead, looked back and saw these old men staring at a rag, so strange.
<br><br>"A few old brothers, a rag and what to see?" Yi Feng could not help but ask in confusion.
<br><br>"Wipe ......"
<br><br>"Wipe?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made several people's jaws almost fall off in shock.
<br><br>Zhentian stones fill the steps.
<br><br>Swift cloak as a rag.
<br><br>Tsk.
<br><br>This gesture ......
<br><br>Such a person who doesn't put imperial treasures in his eyes must be a Martial Saint powerhouse!
<br><br>In the hearts of the four people, there was an instant definition.
<br><br>Knowing that Yi Feng was a Martial Saint powerhouse, the three old men brought by Wu Yonghong made a 180 degree change in attitude and became extremely respectful, while their eyes glared at Wu Yonghong and complained, "Good for you old man Wu, why didn't you tell us clearly beforehand?"
<br><br>"That's right, just now we almost offended this Martial Saint expert."
<br><br>"Hmph, if our attitude just now had caused Senior Martial Saint to get angry, we wouldn't be able to spare you."
<br><br>"You guys, you guys are spouting blood!" Wu Yonghong's face was blue with anger, and he whispered in a lamenting voice, "Did the old man say that or not? Did you say that on the road? It's a thousand instructions, it's obviously you guys who don't believe it."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>The three old men grunted angrily and followed towards Yi Feng with respectful posture and bumbling.
<br><br>"Greetings, Master."
<br><br>Just after walking into the front hall, he found Zhong Qing carrying a ladder to re-hang the eighteen pictures of divine weapons that he had taken down before, and at this moment he just finished hanging the last one and came down the stairs.
<br><br>"Disciple has worked hard, guests are coming, help me move some stools!"
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed softly.
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing obediently walked towards the inside to carry the stools.
<br><br>Yi Feng turned back and said with a smile, "It's a little crowded with the sun inside, so have a seat here in the front hall!"
<br><br>"You're welcome, sir."
<br><br>The four old men nodded their heads and finally stepped into the front hall.
<br><br>Eighteen divine armament pictures, instantly magnified in their eyes, the monstrous martial intent and heavenly power accompanied by a powerful pressure enveloped the entire front hall.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When the four old men saw this scene, they were stunned in place almost at the same time.
<br><br>In that instant, that monstrous martial intent and heavenly dao power made them absorb a great benefit, and found that the cultivation realm that was stuck for hundreds of years actually loosened in this moment.
<br><br>This person, what kind of person is he?
<br><br>At this moment, even Wu Yonghong himself was confused.
<br><br>Just a moment ago, he thought that Yi Feng was a Martial Saint expert, a big rank higher than him, a Martial Sect, but now it seemed that it was more than a Martial Saint!
<br><br>This, Martial Emperor?
<br><br>No, it's Martial God!
<br><br>But, Martial Gods don't see such a big gesture, right? Such a big gesture, could it be an immortal martial artist from that upper world?
<br><br>Immortal.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>A breath of cold air.
<br><br>This word was simply unattainable for them.
<br><br>The moment they thought that Yi Feng might be an immortal martial artist of the upper world, the four of them felt their blood boiling.
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder he looked like a mortal.
<br><br>Only now did it dawn on the four that they had finally found the reason for not being able to see through Yi Feng's cultivation level.
<br><br>"Please sit."
<br><br>The stool was brought up and Yi Feng handed it to them while saying, "You guys stay here for a while, I'll go pour you some water."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng walked towards the backyard.
<br><br>The next moment Yi Feng left, the four old men instantly exploded.
<br><br>"Martial intent, martial intent, such a powerful martial intent, I've never seen such a powerful martial intent, ah, the realm I've been stuck in for hundreds of years has loosened up!"
<br><br>"Yes, I also loosened up, which is accompanied by the power of the heavenly dao!"
<br><br>"Immortal martial artist, he must be an immortal martial artist, I really didn't expect it, I was actually able to make contact with an immortal martial artist!"
<br><br>For a while, the four people were excited and filled with hot tears at the same time.
<br><br>The monstrous martial intent and the power of the heavenly dao contained in this wall picture had brought them too much benefit.
<br><br>But not long after, the four felt a little uncomfortable.
<br><br>"I... I feel like I can't hold on a bit." Old man Abacus was the first to speak up, "This martial intent is too strong, I can only sense so much, if I sit down any longer, I'm going to go off the rails."
<br><br>"Yes, I can't hold on either." The skinny old man said the same: "What a pity, obviously such a great opportunity, but you can't eat it."
<br><br>"I,...... how about sitting outside?" Old man Wu also said with a face full of sweat.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, the skeleton old man carried the stool and ran outside.
<br><br>The others, despite their faces full of reluctance, knew they simply could not eat, and also hurriedly boarded the stool and sat outside the door.
<br><br>"Hey, how come a few of you went outside the door?"
<br><br>Yi Feng came out with water and asked in confusion.
<br><br>Hearing this, several faces looked at Yi Feng with gratitude while also filled with embarrassment.
<br><br>Knowing that this is the opportunity given to them by Yi Feng, but hated that they are not capable enough, so a few moments have been unable to bear, had to explain with a bitter face: "That, that outside the scenery is good, outside the scenery is good ......"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, the scenery is good."
<br><br>The rest of the few people, also a strong accompanying smile.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, can also understand these old men, after all, a handful of years, sunshine also understand, after putting the water down, said, "play two chess, you guys wait, I go get."
<br><br>"Good, good."
<br><br>The four people were busy nodding their heads.
<br><br>Just then, Zhong Qing came with the sun-dried plaque and carried out the ladder to hang it up.
<br><br>Almost instantly, the four felt powerful martial intent radiating from that plaque. Luckily, the martial intent of the plaque was not as strong as that of the front hall, so it was not too strong to hold up.
<br><br>Can't help but, the four old men's eyes hairy gold stars.
<br><br>Full of gratitude.
<br><br>It seemed that this senior knew in his heart that they could not comprehend the martial intent of the front hall and purposely hung the plaque up for them to comprehend.
<br><br>"Such kindness!"
<br><br>"Such a great kindness!"
<br><br>"Absolutely can't let down senior's kindness ah ......"
<br><br>The four people were filled with hot tears.
<br><br>They hastily moved the small bamboo stools into a row and sat in a good manner, feeling the martial intent coming from the plaque.
