"The sky will soon be dark ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng turned around in the surrounding jungle, still no sign of Yun Lu Hua, looking at the darkening sky, only able to helplessly rush back to the camp.
<br><br>"Crap?"
<br><br>But just walked back to the camp, when he raised his head, suddenly stunned!
<br><br>At this moment, around his camp, tripped all kinds of beast's corpse, what leopard ah, wild boar ah, wolf ah, all kinds of ......
<br><br>"Can't be?"
<br><br>"I can't be modulating a super poison, I really just mix it out as a strombolian ah!"
<br><br>Look at the death of these animals, and remembered the previous dead snakes and eagles, Yi Feng was able to guess the probability that the cause of death of these beasts is their own sprinkling of powder!
<br><br>"Sins!"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but skimmed, hurriedly threw the medicine bottle in his hand, afraid of poisoning himself, and then used water to wash away the white powder on the ground, and only then returned to his camp feeling quite safe.
<br><br>"However, these wild game is also unavailable good things ah!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Although accidentally killing so many beasts makes Yi Feng quite guilty, but thinking about their meat, Yi Feng can't help but drool again.
<br><br>You know, in this world food is very difficult to find.
<br><br>First take martial arts cultivators, their minds are on cultivation, simply will not have too much appetite for food. And another class of mortals are thinking about how to make ends meet, and will not spend too much thought on the appetite, simply to fill the hunger on the line, even if you throw him a pig's feet do not know how to do.
<br><br>So, food is very expensive in this world, which is why a bowl of beef noodles costs a gold coin.
<br><br>Therefore, the carcasses of these animals in his eyes at the moment, is a plate of braised pig's feet, cold leopard meat, roasted whole wolf ......
<br><br>Just the idea is good, but to bring so many things down the mountain has become a problem.
<br><br>"Damn, empty guard the mountain ah ......"
<br><br>"Fuck!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed viciously, full of breathlessness, sat back on the green stone slab, bored, took out the acoustic guitar.
<br><br>"Pass the time!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's palm gently fell on the strings, and the pleasant sound of the guitar spread through the mountain forest.
<br><br>Just then, in Yi Feng's mind, the long-lost system sounded.
<br><br>"Ding, congratulations to the host for activating a new mission."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng jerked to his feet, with an expectant look in his eyes, expecting that this system would find a conscience and get him something that would make him a cultivator, or worse, make him an otherworldly god!
<br><br>"Mission content: to practice the qin, chess, calligraphy and painting to a state comparable to God!
<br><br>"Reward: one mount."
<br><br>"Holy shit Nima!"
<br><br>After hearing the system's voice, Yi Feng's hopes were dashed again, and he burst into a huge foul mouth.
<br><br>I thought it was something good, but it turned out to be these miscellaneous tasks.
<br><br>You say a little use is just as well, take the practice of boxing iron, let him feed himself are difficult. Even easy to get rich, but also he relied on his own skills of travellers, writing books, and this broken system is not related to the hair.
<br><br>But that's not bad, at least playing iron or something, at least he did not let him starve to death these years.
<br><br>But his mother's piano, chess, calligraphy and painting, he really can not think of any use.
<br><br>Is it used to cultivate sentiment?
<br><br>Of course, the most let him spit is the task reward!
<br><br>He did not forget, when the system issued a task for him to run the martial arts school, said that he was rewarded with a super expert scenario.
<br><br>He was looking forward to it, thinking that the peak of his life was coming, but what kind of blow did reality give him?
<br><br>He said it was a super master, but it was a half-dead, broken skull!
<br><br>He admits that it looks pretty scary, but apart from causing trouble, it's useless.
<br><br>So the mount?
<br><br>Oh ......
<br><br>"I pooh!"
<br><br>Yi Feng hate broken bite, he does not believe that this broken system can really reward a good mount to him, the probability is to get out a daddy's stuff.
<br><br>So this task, he did not bother to complete.
<br><br>Under the anger, Yi Feng kicked the guitar in his hand, looking at it to be angry.
<br><br>But he just kicked away, and then came the voice of the system.
<br><br>"Mission failure penalty: take back the martial arts school, no longer belong to the host!"
<br><br>"Nani?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face immediately became black, full of anger and wanted to explode out.
<br><br>Although those skills are useless, but this martial arts school is his place of refuge, even if he is now rich, can completely buy another house, but these years of feelings and that sense of belonging can not be bought.
<br><br>"You are cruel!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed, and picked up the guitar, crackling up the East Windbreak.
