 "Master Skeleton?"
<br><br>"Hmph!"
<br><br>"Am I that old?"
<br><br>A voice came out from under the well cover, with anger.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Ao Qing hurriedly changed his mouth, "Brother, brother, skeleton brother, you are handsome and elegant, suave, it was my momentary mistake to call the wrong mouth!"
<br><br>"OhË±Å?"
<br><br>"I can't imagine that you dog son is still quite up to date."
<br><br>Under the well cover, a satisfied voice immediately came out.
<br><br>This was a momentary plea for mercy, but I did not expect to receive praise from the skull, Ao Qing's eyes narrowed, immediately understood the way to get along with the skull brother, and said: "Brother Skull you are joking, what kind of road I count, I just said a big truth."
<br><br>"Even before you came out of the gate, I was attracted by your aura."
<br><br>"Oh?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Sure enough, with one sentence, the skeleton was hoisted by Ao Qing's interest and hurriedly said, "Come on, come on, you tell me exactly how I attracted you."
<br><br>Ao Qing grinned heatedly, squinted his eyes and said incessantly, "At that time, I was thinking, what kind of a supreme demon is it that has this kind of aura? And after you came out of the gate, I counted to really comprehend what the phrase feeling is better than seeing at first sight really means!"
<br><br>"Especially your unique aura, the attitude of being able to bend and stretch, simply lit up my eyes."
<br><br>"Since that day ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ao Qing's expression became sincere, with a yearning.
<br><br>"Since that day, I have secretly vowed in my heart that I must become a person like brother in this life!"
<br><br>"Good good, there is really no one who knows me better than you!" Under the lid of the well, an excited voice came out, shouting loudly in appreciation, "I'm sure you're a friend, tell me if there's anything you want to do in the future, I'll cover you!"
<br><br>"Okay, thank you brother."
<br><br>Ao Qing shook up his mouth attentively.
<br><br>"On the road on the road, quickly, quickly help me to move this manhole cover." Under the well cover, another urgent voice came: "Someone is coming soon, the master is not at home, I'll take you to mess things up."
<br><br>"Immediately brother."
<br><br>The dog did not dare to delay, hurriedly moved the well cover, then a skull head jumped out.
<br><br>With the moment the skull head jumped out, from all around the room, a white bone flew, pieced together into a complete skull frame.
<br><br>However, just after it was put together, it fell apart and was scattered all over the place.
<br><br>"Grass, where's my spine?"
<br><br>The skeleton on the ground, at once, cursed out loud.
<br><br>"Brother, it seems that the master took your cervical vertebrae as a clothesline, wait, I'll go get it for you." Wagging his tail, Ao Qing ran to the door upside down and brought back the cervical vertebrae.
<br><br>"Good, I really did not misjudge you."
<br><br>The skeleton was full of appreciation, and with the cervical vertebrae, the skeleton was put back together, not forgetting to put that black robe on.
<br><br>"Tsk."
<br><br>"This temperament, this domineering, hate that I am only a male body, ah, otherwise certainly fascinated under the brother your black robe." Seeing this, Ao Qing was again a rainbow fart that did not show traces, bombarded towards the skeleton like a wild storm.
<br><br>The skeleton raised its head and was blown away by Ao Qing, and a white claw reached out under the black robe and grabbed Ao Qing.
<br><br>Ao Qing instantly felt a blackness in front of his eyes, and when he reappeared, he found that he had already arrived outside Pingjiang City.
<br><br>This hand.
<br><br>Ao Qing's jaw dropped in shock.
<br><br>Pingjiang City is not big, not small, but is located under the Castle Peak Gate, but also a distance of more than a thousand miles.
<br><br>This just a moment, to a thousand miles away.
<br><br>It is simply the legendary "the sky is the limit"!
<br><br>Can't help but, Ao Qing more attentive, repeatedly praised: "Brother's means is simply amazing, my generation model ah!"
<br><br>"Haha, small means, small means!"
<br><br>Skeleton a loud laugh, palms, hands out of thin air appeared in the hands of a recliner, placed in the open road, a trip down.
<br><br>Squinting his eyes, crossing his legs, his mouth leisurely said: "I have to say, the master of this guy really knows how to enjoy!"
<br><br>"Hey, that's right, you and the master are both models for my generation!"
<br><br>Ao Qing squinted his eyes in flattery, squatting at the skeleton's feet, two forelimbs hammering on the skeleton's thighs ......
<br><br>"Ye Bei, you despicable, and also the old ancestor I engage in hunger marketing, I'm not finished with you!"
<br><br>And in the sky not far away, several figures stepped into the air, while also came out the voice of the old ancestor of Castle Peak cursing.
<br><br>"Aiya Old Brother Qingshan, you misunderstood, Little Left and Little Right are just closed." Ye Bei patted Old Ancestor Qingshan's shoulder and said comfortingly, "When we return from this trip, they will be out of seclusion."
<br><br>"Hmph, don't think I don't know what the hell you're thinking." Old Ancestor Qing Shan snorted angrily, "The only one who can save your life is yourself, after all, if the senior wants to kill you, no one can save you!"
<br><br>"Older brother said this is where the words, when the time comes, only need older brother in front of the sir to help me a few good words!" Ye Bei said with a smile.
<br><br>However, just as he finished speaking, he found that a terrifying aura ahead of him was covering him.
<br><br>In an instant, he lost control of his body, like a boat in a storm without any resistance!
