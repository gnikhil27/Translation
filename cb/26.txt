"Whew!"
<br><br>Even Old Man Wu couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air at this moment.
<br><br>He raised his head and looked at Yi Feng across the room with deep meaning, which in his opinion, Yi Feng's act of taking out the flame bead was like a response to the question in his heart.
<br><br>Like saying, I can just take out the flame beads, but you?
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng noticed old man Wu's gaze, nodded towards him with a smile, showing a look of acceptance, after all, this chess, he won again without effort.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Seeing this, old man Wu was sure that Yi Feng really was what he thought.
<br><br>He took a look at the chess, yes, he lost the chess, but his intention was not here, the two had risen from chess to another level of competition.
<br><br>It must be said that he never expected Yi Feng to be able to take out the flame beads.
<br><br>The value of the flame bead was more expensive than expected.
<br><br>Matching its value were the Water Spirit Pearl, Earth Domain Pearl, Vajra Pearl, and Wood Breath Pearl. If the five precious pearls were combined together, they were able to turn into the Great Immeasurable Pearl, which could make a mortal who had never cultivated before, become a saint in an instant. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>According to the legend, there is a great power in the North Sea has gathered the other four spiritual pearls, only missing a flame bead.
<br><br>But did not expect that this flame bead, here ......
<br><br>If you take this bead to exchange with that great power who happens to be short of a flame bead, you can almost exchange it for treasures that surpass this bead countless times.
<br><br>However, he didn't.
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>With his cultivation level, it is unlikely that he did not know about it.
<br><br>That means, he knew he could exchange the flame bead for something of higher value, but did not do so, it means that he is not that needy for something several times more valuable than the flame bead.
<br><br>Even, is not looking at ......
<br><br>This person, the cultivation can not see through, the mind, but also a little more powerful than I thought ah!
<br><br>Old man Wu looked at Yi Feng, heart down so a judgment.
<br><br>It seems to be taking out a flame bead, but the value it represents, can be much more than a flame bead!
<br><br>In other words, if he wanted to win more under this competition, he would have to take out a treasure that was several times higher than the flame bead.
<br><br>No wonder, no wonder he could be so confident.
<br><br>But ......
<br><br>You seem to have underestimated me as well.
<br><br>Old man Wu's eagle eyes flashed a flash of sharpness, he really has such a thing in his hand.
<br><br>"Older brother Yi, help me look at this." Saying that, he waved his palm, a rake with seven teeth appeared in his hand.
<br><br>See the rake suddenly appeared in his hand, Yi Feng did not care, it is estimated that the old man just came back to planting by the way.
<br><br>This rake is probably not very good, know that he moonlighting iron, asked him to help see. Then take a look at it, Yi Feng took it with his hand and carefully measured up.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng sizing up the look, old man Wu just like a self-congratulatory smile.
<br><br>The seven-toothed holy rake looks dull, no bright spot, but it is a divine object handed down from the ancient times, but it has the grade of a holy product, even if it is damaged, but if it is activated with Yuan Qi, it can still play a tenth of the power of a holy product.
<br><br>Saint.
<br><br>The stuff of legends.
<br><br>Even if it is slightly broken, but its value is definitely not a flame bead can be compared to.
<br><br>And this, I believe that with Yi Feng's cultivation level, he was definitely able to see it.
<br><br>So at this moment, he had even seen Yi Feng's jaw dropping in shock next.
<br><br>The first thing you should do is to get the seven-tooth holy rake, but it took all his life savings, and even lost half his life to get it, so it's not too much to say that Yi Feng will be surprised later.
