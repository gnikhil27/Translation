Hearing that.
<br><br>Night energy is also hurriedly propped up.
<br><br>The two saw that on the table.
<br><br>A teapot was placed, the teapot was still warm, wafting out a faint fragrance of tea.
<br><br>And it was this tea fragrance that made the two people feel better.
<br><br>And on the side of the teapot, there was a rice paper pressed with a cup.
<br><br>On the rice paper.
<br><br>There were two big, strong, powerful words written.
<br><br>-- Drink tea!
<br><br>Night Neng was shivering with excitement, tears were flowing directly out of his eyes as he excitedly shouted, "Yi'er, the pen and ink are not yet dry, these two words were left to us by the gentleman!"
<br><br>"I think the gentleman has long known that we have this difficulty, and even more calculated that we will come at this moment!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"So deliberately brewed tea, leaving clues to guide us how to do."
<br><br>"It seems that the gentleman really is a mistake, everything is in his control ah!"
<br><br>"Quick, drink the tea."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Night Yi also excited body is trembling, with the last ounce of strength of the body lifted the teapot, one person poured a cup.
<br><br>The two people grabbed this life-saving straw, and did not care to taste, both hands picked up the teacup and drank it all.
<br><br>Tea in the mouth, moisten the throat to flow down.
<br><br>The warmth immediately swam throughout the body, as if a dry riverbed, ushered in a stream, while also growing flowers and grasses, which instantly restored the entire riverbed to life.
<br><br>The two comfortably thrashed.
<br><br>The pain caused by the Soul Suppression Nail was instantly swept away, while the cultivation on their bodies was also recovering extremely fast.
<br><br>"Quickly, Yi'er, with this power, try to see if you can force out the Soul Suppressing Nails."
<br><br>Night Energy said busily.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Night Yi moved her jade palm.
<br><br>The body's Yuan Qi flowed through the wide meridians and converged towards the top of her head.
<br><br>But the next moment, Night Yi cried out in alarm.
<br><br>"Father, the Soul Suppressing Nail, it disappeared."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Night can reveal an incredulous look, is also busy mobilizing cultivation to check, but also surprised to find that his body's soul suppressing nails also completely disappeared.
<br><br>"This is, by the power of the tea, directly melted away?"
<br><br>Night Energy stared at him, incredulous.
<br><br>Night Yi nodded solemnly.
<br><br>I'm afraid that this is the only way to explain why the Soul Suppressing Nails disappeared for good reason.
<br><br>The two people revealed a strong look of reverence, at this moment, that white-robed figure in their hearts, just like a god.
<br><br>This is the real supreme man!
<br><br>What is the soul nail?
<br><br>What's a white shallow one?
<br><br>Mr. even do not even have to personally, brew a pot of tea, you can make this so-called soul nail into nothingness.
<br><br>What's funny is that what Bai Shanyi, actually dared to play against Mr., and even wildly threatened to test Mr. enough to be her subordinate.
<br><br>I shame!
<br><br>Really do not know the sky is high, when the time to die do not know how to die.
<br><br>A thousand miles away, a flying boat hovering at the far end.
<br><br>Closed-eyed resting, white shallow one, fiercely opened the eyes.
<br><br>In his eyes, there was a strong flash of surprise.
<br><br>"I'm really a little surprised!"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the two old men behind her couldn't help but speak out in surprise, "Goddess, what happened?"
<br><br>"The Soul Suppressing Nails on those two trash were pulled out." Bai Shanyi said in a deep voice.
<br><br>The two old men were also slightly shocked.
<br><br>"Then Goddess, what should we do next?"
<br><br>"No harm, it was only pulled out, at best, it can be considered to be in our eyes, not a threat." White shallow one waved his hand, full of care, said.
<br><br>"What the Goddess said is true."
<br><br>One of the old men nodded respectfully, "But those two Soul Suppressing Nails are also rare treasures of Bai Yang True Palace after all, so the Goddess should take them back, lest they fall into that person's hands."
<br><br>"That is natural, my things, if they are not approved by me, no one can keep them."
<br><br>Bai Shangyi flushed a cold smile.
<br><br>The next instant, the jade palm hand seals move, around the lingering ghostly light spread out in all directions, towards the soul nail, a thousand miles away, passed.
<br><br>"Soul nail, back!"
<br><br>The hand seal fell at the same time, white shallow one lightly shouted.
<br><br>PS: the last two days, the body is too poor, long-term stay up too much, sorry, tomorrow to resume two to three more.
