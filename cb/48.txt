"Woof woof woof!"
<br><br>Ao Qing was lying in the front hall, and any stranger who approached the door he would bow up and show a hoarse grin.
<br><br>He had now completely taken on this role.
<br><br>He even sometimes forgot that he was a Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, so he could be said to be doing his duty.
<br><br>Now that he has been following Yi Feng for a long time, the eighteen pictures in the front hall will no longer be hostile to him.
<br><br>For this reason, it was still a little proud.
<br><br>This must be that senior's approval of it!
<br><br>Just then, a gust of wind hit it, and Ao Qing raised his head and found that a cloaked man appeared in front of the door of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Ao Qing's pupils shrank and was sitting up.
<br><br>Because in this person's body, felt a clear hostility and pressure.
<br><br>Jing Wufeng's sharp gaze observed the surroundings, and with a movement of his palm, a Yuan Qi spread out, immediately causing him to frown. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Why is it that I feel Senior Brother Wudu's aura here, but I can't see Senior Brother's person? And this martial school was not slaughtered ......"
<br><br>"It seems likely that senior brother is here!"
<br><br>His gaze shrank slightly and his pupils locked onto this small martial school in front of him.
<br><br>"Get out of the way, get out of the way."
<br><br>Just then, a peddler pushing a crate passed by, and when he saw Jing Wufeng blocking the middle of the road, he hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>A flash of hostility flashed in Jing Wufeng's eyes, and with a wave of his cloak behind him, the peddler screamed miserably and his entire body disappeared, leaving only a lone shuttle cart overturned on the ground.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Ao Qing was startled, knowing that he was not a match for this man, he hastily hid in the dark.
<br><br>"Unenlightened mortals."
<br><br>Jing Wufeng chanted disdainfully, then walked towards the martial arts hall, not noticing that he stepped on the Heaven-shaking Stone and took a step inside.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"Something unusual?"
<br><br>As soon as he walked in, he felt a hint of weirdness in the front hall, but he did not change color, but his cloak moved to block in front of him.
<br><br>"Humph, a small blindfold, but so."
<br><br>But his voice just fell, the whole face changed, the eighteen pictures of weapons abruptly emitted golden light, destroying the sky and covering the earth towards him.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Feeling the words of destruction, the face instantly changed greatly, the cloak waved, turned into a stream of light and rushed towards the door.
<br><br>But even if he was fast, even if he escaped out of the door, but still did not escape a disaster, in an instant was hit by the ashes, all over his body in addition to that cloak still floating in the air, only a section of bones left to fall on the ground.
<br><br>Even this section of bone, that is also net windless cultivation of some kind of bizarre gong method mutation to stay, otherwise is not even slag.
<br><br>"Hoo hoo hoo hoo."
<br><br>Ao Qing saw this scene throughout, his eyes fell to the ground, almost even his heart jumped out.
<br><br>It really is as terrifying as this!
<br><br>While at the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, Yi Feng was still drinking with Yin Xiong and the others.
<br><br>Yi Feng was happy.
<br><br>He didn't expect that the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce had given him another 100,000 gold coins today.
<br><br>And after dealing with Peng Ying and Yu Wu Jie's Luo Lan Xue two women, also accompanied the whole Yi Feng's left and right, see Yi Feng did not for Wu Jie's matter on the heart, the two lamented the senior really open-minded at the same time, the heart also suddenly a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Finally, after a full meal, Yi Feng took his little disciple Zhong Qing home.
<br><br>Home did not let them send, but took Zhong Qing shopping downtown, after all, rich, why not squander ah!
<br><br>"Niece ah, there is really nothing wrong with today's matter, right?" On the other side, after Yi Feng left, Yin Xiong worriedly asked towards Luo Lanxue.
<br><br>"This senior has always been open-minded, don't worry, even if something is wrong, our Qingshan Sect will solve it." Luo Lanxue said softly and comfortingly.
<br><br>Yin Xiong then nodded, suddenly remembered something and asked, "Right niece, recently Mr. Yi's book is a big fire, there are many people secretly inquiring about Mr. Yi's news, do you see?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's pupils shrank slightly.
<br><br>Thinking for a moment then said, "Mr. book is only to experience life, not to want any fame and fortune, and he likes to be pure, so Mr. news must not leak out, in case Mr. disturbed, you and I sin unforgivable ah!"
<br><br>Yin Xiong took a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>There was some fear.
<br><br>There are indeed many people inquiring about Yi Feng's news, of course most of them are admirers, originally he thought it was nothing, but now listening to Luo Lanxue together, it is really.
<br><br>Fortunately did not leak out the information of Mr.
