The night wind centipede's words made the crowd of demons present look shocked.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?" The Leopard King asked with a solemn expression on his face.
<br><br>"Alas!"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede let out a soft sigh, slightly raising his head, his thoughts seemed to be caught up in that great battle just now.
<br><br>"Just ahead of the stream, I, the Eagle King and the Snake King found that person's trail, and then the three of us joined forces with him in a great battle, a battle that caused the Eagle King and the Snake King were killed on the spot, and seriously injured since they know they are unable to fight again, in order to prevent him from escaping, had to use up the last ounce of strength, to three legs as the cost before running out to give you guys a message ......"
<br><br>The words fell, the crowd of demons present have cast a respectful gaze toward the night wind centipede.
<br><br>That battle, it must have been very tragic!
<br><br>Even the eagle king and snake king were killed in battle, in order to be able to run out to report, the night wind demon spirit is also afraid of a big price!
<br><br>"Night wind demon spirit, the territory has you such a loyal and dedicated in, is really our territory's fortune! Leopard King said in a solemn tone: "You rest well, leave the next thing to us, we will save the Demon Emperor, and at the same time avenge the Snake King and Eagle King."
<br><br>The Leopard King's words drew a burst of approval from the demons.
<br><br>"No, no, no, I am really ashamed to say that I watched the Demon Emperor being captured and the Snake King and Eagle King being magnificent and I could do nothing about it, I ...... deserve to die!" Night Wind Centipede lowered his head and said with guilt. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Night Wind Demon Spirit what are you talking about, you and the Snake King Eagle King have done too much for our territory." The Pig King hurriedly said, "This person is not even a match for the Demon Emperor in a single fight, yet you guys sparred him into a serious disability, that's more than enough!"
<br><br>"Good, originally we already owe too much to the other territories, and in this way, we don't need to rely on the demon emperors of the other territories to do anything at all."
<br><br>"Therefore, you three, are the great merits of our territory!"
<br><br>"Next, let's leave it to us!"
<br><br>"All listen to the order, this person is already seriously disabled, set out with all your might to rescue the Demon Emperor and avenge the Snake King Eagle King!"
<br><br>The voice fell, the crowd's emotions soared, with unprecedented morale quickly set off, rushing towards Yi Feng's location.
<br><br>And after the leopard king and other left, just dying night wind centipede suddenly burst out of unprecedented speed.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye.
<br><br>And disappeared!
<br><br>......
<br><br>"This cloud road flower is really hard to find!"
<br><br>Yi Feng drank snake soup, ate eagle meat, and looked at the rolling hills.
<br><br>After having a full stomach, looking at the sky is not yet dark, so he plans to go to the nearby mountains to look for it again, after all, he has time, but Zhong Qing may not be able to wait so long ah!
<br><br>So Yi Feng picked up a small shovel and was ready to go.
<br><br>Just two steps, Yi Feng weighed the old Wang Ba in his hand, turned around and gave it to hang on the tree.
<br><br>After all, this several pounds of the old Wang Ba, old so carry is not a matter, anyway, will return at night, temporarily hanging in the tree will not have what people take.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"What's going on here?"
<br><br>In the jungle, the woman of the Royal Sword Sect looked around in amazement, she suddenly found that all the demonic beasts in the mountain forest all gathered in one direction.
<br><br>And this direction was exactly where she had come from.
<br><br>Likewise, it was also where Yi Feng was!
<br><br>"Although I don't know what these demonic beasts are because of, but I'm afraid you won't have that kind of luck this time ......"
<br><br>The woman sighed faintly.
<br><br>But there is nothing you can do, after all, people have their own lives, good luck can not always favor a person.
<br><br>The good thing is that all those demon beasts above the demon spirit gathered in that direction, making her feel more relaxed than ever.
<br><br>"However, it's better to wait for the clan's people to come, and then I can leave!"
<br><br>The woman pondered slightly and wanted to leave, but a day ago, she had informed the clan of what had happened here with a secret method, and with her status, it was impossible for the Imperial Sword Sect not to send someone.
<br><br>Although now is the best time for her to leave the mountain, for the sake of insurance, she still intends to come with the Royal Sword Sect before saying anything.
<br><br>At this time, a group of great demons above the demon spirit level, such as the Leopard King, finally arrived at the stream.
<br><br>However, after arriving at the stream, in addition to a ground of eagle hair and the corpses of all the demons left before, there was no trace of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Where is the man?"
<br><br>The Leopard King shouted.
<br><br>The other demons also swept around with sharp eyes, they did not want to run and pounce, otherwise they would have failed to live up to the information that the Night Wind Centipede had exchanged for the price of three legs.
<br><br>"Look at that!"
<br><br>Just when they couldn't find Yi Feng, the Pig King suddenly exclaimed.
<br><br>At the sound of his voice, the demons turned their gaze towards the past.
<br><br>That creek side, green stone side of the tree trunk, with grass rope binding hanging old king ...... is not their daydreaming Bo Gu demon emperor?
<br><br>The tang demon emperor was hanging in the tree, the demon eyes almost burst out, blood rushed straight to the brain.
<br><br>"Listen to my order, save the demon emperor!"
