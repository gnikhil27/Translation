Mid-continent.
<br><br>Four black robes were lying on the eaves.
<br><br>The first black robe contained a skeleton with a skeletal head with a wonderful expression, holding a blade of grass in its teeth.
<br><br>The second black robe showed a dog's head, tilted head, lustful.
<br><br>The third black robe is a centipede, a pair of pincers from time to time clamped.
<br><br>The last black robe is a big black bear, naive black robe is too small, only cover a shoulder, the whole black robe support the tight bang.
<br><br>"Big brother big brother, wait a moment, the thousand-search clan's saint daughter will pass by here later." The dog said in a hurry.

<br><br>Bone Ben Wei hurriedly straightened the black robe on his body, posed and asked.

<br><br>The dog diligently pulled out a suit from his arms and laid it out in front of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Qing ah, what are you?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the clothes in amazement.
<br><br>"Hey, you don't know this, right?" The dog said quietly: "I heard the master next door said, when the master sold clothes to make a living, and this set of clothes is the master sold the rest of the year."
<br><br>"And this owner seems to call it, what is it called ......"
<br><br>"Yes, I remember, tight pants, bean shoes, the girl gods."
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Good stuff."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei drew a breath backwards, hastily removed his black robe, put on the tight pants and bean shoes, and turned around in place.
<br><br>"How's that?"
<br><br>He asked excitedly.
<br><br>"Absolutely beautiful."
<br><br>The three dogs gave a thumbs up.
<br><br>"Let's go brothers, keep watch."
<br><br>With a snap of his fingers, Bone Ben Wei swept up into the air and the four brothers arrived inside a restaurant and sat down at a table by the window.
<br><br>"Brother, today is bound to be a success."
<br><br>Centipede said with a cheerful face.
<br><br>"That's right, don't you see what kind of reputation brother has in the Central Continent today, that Thousand Seekers Sect's Holy Maiden will be weak in the legs when she sees it?" The dog's face was full of fart.
<br><br>"Oops."
<br><br>"Low-key, low-key."
<br><br>"Brother I ah, only want to find a true love, so in front of her ah, I do not want to reveal my identity."
<br><br>"I want that sister to love me because of my temperament, my handsome, not covet my identity strength, not to mention covet my money."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei said after pressing the palm of his hand.
<br><br>And at this time in the sky.
<br><br>There stood two figures, it was the middle-aged man and the old man who came from the North Sea.
<br><br>"What you say, is this oddball?"
<br><br>"What the hell is he wearing?"
<br><br>The middle-aged man said with a frown.
<br><br>"My lord, people can't look like people, this person's strength is indeed okay." The old man said, "If you don't believe me, look, this is a picture of him fighting a certain clan alone some time ago."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>He raised his palm.
<br><br>A picture was presented in mid-air.
<br><br>In the picture.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei was forking his waist, and with one palm, he pinned a dozen Martial Emperors to the ground, unable to move.
<br><br>"En, looking at that posture, it is indeed him."
<br><br>The middle-aged man shrunk his pupils, then turned his gaze towards the tavern.
<br><br>"Let's go, let's go meet him for a while."
<br><br>With a sweeping movement, the middle-aged man arrived at the entrance of the tavern, and the two men slowly went upstairs.
<br><br>With that.
<br><br>The two men sat down at the table next to Bones Ben Wei and moved their ears to listen to the conversation of the four men.
<br><br>"Brother, I tell you, later you appear, must give that girl, leave a deep impression." The dog whispered.
<br><br>"Indeed, but how to leave a deep impression?" Bone Ben Wei asked.
<br><br>"It's not that simple?"
<br><br>The dog laughed: "When that sister passes by later, I will pretend to grab the centipede's stuff, and at this time, you can descend from the sky and slap me away."
<br><br>"And that sister see you this act of righteousness, and good character, plus brother you this handsome face, that sister's eyes will not look straight?"
<br><br>"Oops, good plan!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei slapped his thigh.
<br><br>Can't help but will appreciate the gaze to the dog.
<br><br>"Qing ah, you really deep in my heart!"
<br><br>"Toiling for big brother, it's all as it should be."
<br><br>The dog smiled and nodded, remembering something, the dog paw pulled out a red rose, and said in a hurry: "Remember brother, this flower, be sure to bring."
<br><br>"But at first you have to give it first hidden, can not let the sister see that you are deliberately, let alone let the sister know that you have flowers, to take out inadvertently, to give her a surprise."
<br><br>"Seconds!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei jaw a, busy the rose tucked away.
<br><br>"Qing ah, any more brilliant ideas?"
<br><br>"Of course, there are many details of the place, big brother you listen to me one by one." The dog whispered towards Bones Ben Wei talked about it.
<br><br>And a side.
<br><br>After listening for a while, seeing that the four people were talking about something that was not nutritious, the middle-aged man finally picked up his glass of wine and came over towards this side.
<br><br>"Meeting each other is fate, I am Lv Xinwei, I would like to make friends with the four of you, I wonder if it is possible?" The middle-aged man raised his wine glass and said with a smile.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Half a sound later.
<br><br>No one paid attention to him.
<br><br>The black bear was wolfing down his food, the centipede was manicuring his nails, while the dog and skeleton Ben Wei were talking to themselves.
<br><br>The four of them, completely treated Lv Xinwei as air, as if this person did not exist.
<br><br>Lv Xinwei frowned.
<br><br>The old man next to him was also filled with anger.
<br><br>What is their status?
<br><br>They had put down their stature to befriend in person, yet they were directly ignored?
