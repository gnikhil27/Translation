At this moment.
<br><br>The experts of the Red Sun lineage swept through the air with a great sound.
<br><br>They had finally arrived at the foot of the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains.
<br><br>"Is Ao Qing still inside the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang inclined his head and looked at his men behind him and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Still here!"
<br><br>The subordinate hurriedly said.
<br><br>"You lead the way, avoid long dreams and take down Ao Qing as fast as possible." Ao Bi Fang said in a cold voice.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The group was then led by this person, and the crowd headed towards the 100,000 Great Mountains.
<br><br>"Wait!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>However, just a little bit deeper into the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains, Ao Bi conveniently waved his palm and stopped.
<br><br>"Did you feel it?"
<br><br>He asked.
<br><br>The people behind him, all nodded their heads, with shock in their eyes along with a hint of panic.
<br><br>Because walking here, they all felt a great movement inside the mountain, and under this movement, many of the other demon beasts and beasts in the mountain were prostrate on the ground, not even daring to move.
<br><br>And even they, the demon clans and demon emperors, also felt the same great pressure.
<br><br>"I wonder which one is breaking through the Demon Emperor in this mountain!" Ao Bi Fang looked at the huge aura gathering in the distance, and his eyes shrunk to pinholes.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>The others asked, becoming hesitant for a while.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang also became hesitant.
<br><br>Even he was also a Demon Sect Perfection, one step short of Demon Dignity, but this step was like a chasm.
<br><br>He did not have the slightest fighting power in front of a real Demon Dignity expert.
<br><br>That was why, when he saw those three Martial Dignity experts at the Martial Hall, he ran so fast.
<br><br>After a little thought, he said: "With that kind of waste, even if Ao Qing is already a demon king, but under the pressure of this demon daddy's breakthrough, I'm afraid that he would have been lying down and not dared to move, in that case, I'll wait here for a while, and then go to him after this demon daddy has finished his breakthrough."
<br><br>At these words, the crowd also nodded in agreement.
<br><br>After all, if they rashly offend when such a strong person breaks through, in case they anger the other party, it will definitely not be good for them.
<br><br>So, the Red Sun Clan crowd sat down in the mountain.
<br><br>The breakthrough of the demon daddy was really terrifying as it was.
<br><br>For one night, the entire mountain was enveloped in powerful aura fluctuations, under which the birds and beasts in the mountain scattered and ten thousand demons prostrated.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A night passed, the fluctuations have been dispersed.
<br><br>And the one in the mountain, should also be a breakthrough in the demon daddy.
<br><br>At the same time, Ao Bi Fang, who was sitting on the ground, opened his eyes and asked at the first opportunity, "Ao Qing, is he still in this mountain."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The handlers said in a hurry.
<br><br>"There is no time to lose, set out immediately and take Ao Qing down quickly." Ao Bi Fang commanded.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, the subordinate continued to lead the way ahead.
<br><br>At the beginning, Ao Qingcheng had left a special aura on Ao Qing's body, which was a special means of his Red Sun lineage, and this person had learned it.
<br><br>Following this aura, the group continued to rush toward the mountain.
<br><br>Half an hour later, it was already a long way deep into the 100,000 Great Mountains, and just when Ao Bi Fang was a little impatient, the leader in front of him took a step.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang, that waste is in the valley ahead."
<br><br>Hearing that, Ao Bi Fang's eyes slightly lit up.
<br><br>Two dozen people swept towards the valley ahead in ghost-like form, and sure enough, Ao Qing was sitting on the rock with his eyes closed in the form of a Heaven-devouring Demon Wolf.
<br><br>"A waste of time, pretending!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang sneered disdainfully.
<br><br>After beckoning, he ordered, "Spread out, surround him, make sure not to give him a way out, after everything is ready, listen to my order, attack together to capture him alive."
<br><br>The people nodded, their bodies turned into a lightning swept out, and soon surrounded Ao Qing.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Bi nodded his head in satisfaction.
<br><br>Although it could be said that he could capture a broken demon king with his hands as a demon clan, perhaps it was due to the fall of the two demon clans of Shura and the matter of the martial school that made him act much more cautiously nowadays.
<br><br>"Prepare ......"
<br><br>He passed out the order.
<br><br>At the word, the crowd was poised and ready to go.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>Finally, Ao Bi Fang let out another soft shout.
<br><br>And this order also let the crowd breathe a sigh of relief, perhaps because of the shadow of the martial arts school, fearing that Ao Bi Fang would change his mind again.
<br><br>After the order, more than 20 figures turned into streams of light and pounced towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Bi Fang raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>This time, there would definitely be no surprises.
<br><br>But at the next moment, his face suddenly froze, because Ao Qing suddenly opened his eyes, the ghostly double pupils into two golden light shot towards him.
<br><br>At the same time, an aura of fear for Ao Bi Fang, from Ao Qing's body surged out.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's eyes suddenly widened.
<br><br>PS: I can't stay up, I'm dying suddenly, the remaining chapter will be filled tomorrow.
