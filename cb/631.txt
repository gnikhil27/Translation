A short time did not return.
<br><br>The scale of the island had grown to a point that he could not imagine.
<br><br>The street along the side of the island is simply more lively than the former Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Look and see.
<br><br>The coffin store next to it is all open, and five big, silly, dark-skinned men are sitting at the door.
<br><br>The headquarters of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce also seems to have moved over.
<br><br>The business of tandem dung seems to be getting more and more skilled.
<br><br>Back Yi Feng pretended not to be able to, so he had to relax, play chess with the old men and go to the Yi Hong Yuan to fight landlord.
<br><br>But before that, he also sent out jade slips, contact those without much emotion disciples to come back for a trip, also when the time is intended to take them to the immortal world to open their eyes.
<br><br>Somewhere unknown.
<br><br>A big black hall. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The top was hung with curtains, and behind the curtains lay a person of unknown appearance.
<br><br>"Enlighten the messenger."
<br><br>"Ten of the Heavenly Kui, the soul lamp is extinguished."
<br><br>The subordinate knelt on the periphery and said respectfully.
<br><br>"Where is the extinction?"
<br><br>A voice came from behind the curtain.
<br><br>"Uh, Perdition is nowhere to be seen, but the soul lamp is not extinguished, nor has it returned."
<br><br>There was a slight silence behind the curtain, and there seemed to be some anger, then a deep voice came out, "What the hell is this trash doing?"
<br><br>The subordinates were silent.
<br><br>Only after a long time did a voice continue to come from behind the curtain, "You continue."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"Lord Messenger."
<br><br>"The scouts hidden outside the Heaven and Earth Sect's island have pried out some news through side and rumors."
<br><br>"In the last two days, a big figure from the Heaven and Earth Sect has returned, and if one guesses correctly, it should be that master of the island who has returned."
<br><br>"And after coming back, it seems that he also launched a jade slip on a large scale, and sent orders to his personal disciples sitting down to return to the island."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Behind the curtain, an unexpected voice came out.
<br><br>"If my guess is good, it was the reaction caused by the Ten of Heavenly Kui entering the island, right?"
<br><br>"It seems that although the Heavenly Kui Ten died, the pressure and impact on them was still quite great, or at least they should have sensed our presence and perceived the danger and pressure, and only then had to make that master return personally while also summoning his sitting disciples to return."
<br><br>"It seems that they have been anxious ah!"
<br><br>"I'm afraid that right now, they are discussing how to deal with us, right?"
<br><br>"The messenger is wise."
<br><br>The subordinate complimented, and at that moment, the jade slip flashed.
<br><br>He took out the jade slip to accept the message inside, and his eyes lit up as he hurriedly said, "As expected by the messenger, the scouts have spied from the periphery that a group of core figures on the island have gathered together like never before, and at this moment they are floating in a boat in the lake, and seem to be discussing something big."
<br><br>"Perhaps that master of the island is also among them."
<br><br>This was the sight coming from over there, and the messenger was invited to look over it.
<br><br>The lake breeze was blowing.
<br><br>It was cool and comfortable.
<br><br>Such good weather, Yi Feng naturally called the group of old men on the island to get together.
<br><br>Got a boat, one person a fishing rod.
<br><br>Fishing at the same time, chatting gossip.
<br><br>"I tell you, sir, on our backyard that boar, as long as led around the island, the other sows designated owl ......"
<br><br>"Just last time, to the old Li head of the old sow received a seed, a birth of eighteen, that is a powerful."
<br><br>"Bullshit, my sow gave birth to more, and your boar has nothing to do with it?"
<br><br>"Don't argue, don't argue, what's the point of talking about pigs, let's talk about gossip." Old Wang said in a low voice: "Do you know that the street Liu Gua woman and the cripple Zhang at the end of the street got together."
<br><br>"And not only did they have sex, but they were also seen by Pork Rong."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Tell me, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Shh, keep it down, listen to me, it was a dark and windy night ......"
<br><br>Hearing that, the crowd a curious and nervous face came over.
<br><br>A time, the atmosphere that is called a warm.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>"It's true that I did not expect."
<br><br>A cold laugh came from behind the curtain, full of disdain.
<br><br>"But what's the use of discussing countermeasures?"
<br><br>"In front of absolute strength, everything is vain."
<br><br>"Look at this nervous look on their faces... If I had known this, why would I have done it in the first place?"
<br><br>"From the beginning of the fight for qi with the Lord, your end has been predetermined, the Ten of Heavenly Kui is just a small warning to you."
<br><br>"The real show is still to come, when the people from the other realms come back, it's not too late to draw a hand against them!"
