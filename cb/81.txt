A time.
<br><br>The illusionary longsword forced straight down and was closer and closer to Yi Feng.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng, who was lying on the recliner, did not react in the slightest, completely unaware of the approaching danger.
<br><br>"This Heavenly Yin Formation is really as terrifying as this, this person has no reaction to my attack, which means that he is completely imprisoned in his cultivation ......"
<br><br>With this thought, the look of complacency on Li Mo Xie's face grew stronger and stronger.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The illusionary longsword, only a few feet away from Yi Feng, and the entire martial arts hall was enveloped in this sky-rushing sword light, dazzling and eye-catching.
<br><br>In the next instant, it landed on Yi Feng's brow.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Also at the same time, Li Mo Xie, who was in mid-air, shouted out, his heart agitated to the extreme.
<br><br>So what if you are a Martial Saint or Martial Emperor?
<br><br>He wouldn't even know how he died under his calculations?
<br><br>Thinking that after Yi Feng's death, he was about to be deprived of his Martial Hall full of treasures, and his qi as a supreme expert, the smile on Li Mo Xie's face was thick to the extreme.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>The next instant.
<br><br>His face froze abruptly.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The expression that was just smug disappeared in a blink of an eye, looking at the scene at the entrance of the martial school, his entire person turned into an ice sculpture.
<br><br>Because his Martial Ancestor's full strength strike, the illusionary sword that was conjured up with the <abbr title="Its a heavenly skill">Tongtian skill</abbr>, when it landed on Yi Feng, instead of causing half damage to Yi Feng, it made his attack directly turn into nothingness.
<br><br>As if.
<br><br>It had never appeared.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie was sweating coldly, his eyes staring, his mouth open wide enough to contain a light bulb.
<br><br>"Wasn't he imprisoned in cultivation, why was he still able to block this blow from me?"
<br><br>Ten thousand doubts appeared in Li Mo Xie's heart.
<br><br>Even if there was a mistake in the Heavenly Yin Formation, the man had to at least make some noise to resist his attack, so why did the attack turn into nothingness when it touched him?
<br><br>This is simply too evil ......
<br><br>But the second thought, he thought of something ......
<br><br>After all, this one in front of you, even if it's not a Martial Emperor at least a Martial Saint, even if the cultivation is gone, but a refined defense can still be in.
<br><br>Thinking of this, his face appeared a touch of relief ......
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Li Mo Xie raised the corners of his mouth, the previous fear also disappeared, his face re-surfaced with a chesty cold smile.
<br><br>Although this one's strength is terrifying, his full strength strike also failed to break the defense, but because of this, let Li Mo Xie become even more crazy.
<br><br>After all, the stronger Yi Feng was, the more unparalleled that sense of accomplishment that killing him brought.
<br><br>"Since your defense is monstrous, then I will have to use other means."
<br><br>Li Mo Xie laughed coldly as a series of complicated hand seals were struck, causing the astral wind to rise around him, and as time passed, he formed his hand seals faster and faster, and many bizarre patterns appeared at once.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>When the last of his hand seals fell, the corner of his mouth gently <abbr title="drank - i don't know its meaning i suppose it is spat">spat</abbr>.
<br><br>"<abbr title="Life-taking">Death</abbr> <abbr title="Compulsion(Original)">Gu</abbr>, out!"
<br><br>The moment the voice fell, a bee-sized insect slowly flew out from his mouth, and then, stirring its high frequency wings, it swept towards Yi Feng on the recliner.
<br><br>The death Gu flew out, and a cold smile sprang back on Li Mo Xie's face.
<br><br>"In front of my death Gu, no matter how monstrous your defense is, it doesn't matter, once you let him enter your body, even if your cultivation level is restored, you will only be waiting for death!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie laughed coldly.
<br><br>he also felt proud of himself for having many means, if there was a normal person in this situation, I am afraid there is really no way.
<br><br>"Buzz buzz buzz!"
<br><br>Finally, the <abbr title="Death Gu">life-taking parasite</abbr> approached Yi Feng, hovering around Yi Feng's head, then in Li Mo Xie's nervous gaze, the life-taking parasite flashed its wings and drilled a sprint towards Yi Feng's ear.
<br><br>"It's done."
<br><br>Seeing that it was getting closer and closer, Li Mo Xie was getting more and more excited.
