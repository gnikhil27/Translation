After a cold laugh, Rudasheng took out the other storage ring.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Fortunately, this storage ring was not taken with me."
<br><br>With a big sigh of relief in his heart, Lu Dasheng brought this storage ring back on his hand.
<br><br>Although the storage ring that was plundered by the black-robed man was also very important, but compared to this one, it was nothing, after all, all his good things existed in it.
<br><br>Shogun Mountain Range.
<br><br>At this moment the foot of the mountain has gathered a large number of disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect and the people of the Li family, forming a huge circle, methodically heading towards the mountain.
<br><br>While Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu and the others were standing in the air.
<br><br>"I'm telling you, if you can't find that incense bag, I'll take you for a question." Li Jiaxin looked at the side of Li Renhao, said in a deep voice, in front of this matter, facing this usually loving niece, Li Jiaxin is not half good face.
<br><br>Li Renhao face is miserable white, tightly bite the red lips half a word not to say.
<br><br>The loss of this incense bag is more serious than she imagined. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because this time after going back to the Li family, the Li family's experts found a breath in her body. Due to the effect of this breath, it made her physique all change.
<br><br>However, she just wear that fragrance capsule less than two days lost, if it is worn for a long time, I'm afraid I do not know how much benefit can be obtained.
<br><br>So, when this news came out, the whole Li family and the Royal Sword Sect exploded!
<br><br>In addition to the disciples in the mountain gate, the Royal Sword Sect at the fastest speed will be outside the training disciples all summoned back, all deployed to the Makufu Mountain, just to find this one fragrance bag.
<br><br>The experts of the Li family are also out in full force.
<br><br>So at this moment, except for Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu and others, the whole sky was filled with flying figures.
<br><br>"Everyone listen to me, whether it's the disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect or the disciples of the Li family, as long as they make merit in the process of finding the incense bag, all of them will be able to get the great training of the Li family and the Imperial Sword Sect, and all of the elders will be able to choose any one of them to worship their masters!"
<br><br>"And those who directly find the fragrant bag will be awarded the title of honorary disciple and will be able to choose any one of the two masters of the clan and the Li family to worship!"
<br><br>In the sky, Xu Mo Zhu's rolling voice spread out.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Neat voices shook the mountains and forests.
<br><br>The Royal Sword Sect was originally one of the great sects of the Southern Sand, and it was not known how much more powerful than the Green Mountain Sect, so at this moment, apart from the few disciples guarding the mountain gate, the disciples in the Makufu Mountain Range were already gathered in the millions at this moment.
<br><br>Especially when combined with the Li family's experts, this kind of lineup is terrifying as hell!
<br><br>One of the Shogun Mountain Range.
<br><br>This is another piece of territory next to the Bo Gu territory, as the leading demon here, the Yan snatching demon emperor, has absolute majesty here.
<br><br>At this moment, in front of him, there were two mortals kneeling trembling.
<br><br>"Da Da Da, Great King, spare my life!"
<br><br>The two mortals shivered and begged for mercy.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>The demon emperor snorted coldly, and with a wave of his palm, he took off the heads of the two people, like eating a watermelon, and the two heads turned into white bones, which he casually threw out.
<br><br>And in the direction where he threw them, because the pile of skull heads has become a small mountain.
<br><br>"Cool!"
<br><br>Demon Emperor Yan snatching stuck out his tongue, revealing a satisfied look.
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, it's not good, it's not good!"
<br><br>At this moment, a small demon hurriedly ran over and said, "Something has happened, among our territory, fifteen more demon spirits have died, another three demon kings also have symptoms, I'm afraid it won't be long before they also die!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The demon emperor was furious.
<br><br>Since a few days ago, there were small demons in his territory who suddenly became weak, accompanied by the inability to use their demon power, and slowly died.
<br><br>At that time he did not care too much, after all, there are so many demon beasts in the territory, a little sudden situation is normal. But never thought that the demon spirit was hit not to mention, even the demon king under his command also had an accident.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on, and is this situation occurring in other territories?" Yan snatched the demon emperor asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, wait, I will immediately send people to other territories to inquire." The little demon said in a hurry.
<br><br>But just as he turned around, a few rude voices came from outside.
<br><br>"There is no need to ask, we are already here."
<br><br>Along with the voices, several huge demon qi came, followed by the appearance of several imposing figures.
<br><br>"So it's a few other demon emperors, what's going on?"
<br><br>Yan snatching Demon Emperor hurriedly greeted him and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"We came all the way over to look for you." One of the Changgeng Demon Emperors said, "The situation that occurred in your territory also occurred to us, and some of the territories even suffered more serious losses than yours."
<br><br>"So we came together, just to discuss to discuss, what in the end to do!"
<br><br>"What, your territory actually also appeared?"
<br><br>Yan snatched the demon emperor deeply frowned.
<br><br>If all the territories appeared this kind of weird situation, then this matter is really a fine thought.
