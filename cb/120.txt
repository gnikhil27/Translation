"The sound of this zither actually contains a powerful zither intent?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's face shocked voice, finally understand why Li Jiaxin so nervous!
<br><br>After knowing that this zither sound contained zither intent, without Li Jiaxin saying anything else, he also closed his mouth on his own with good sense and meditated on the intent coming from the zither sound.
<br><br>The sound of the zither is long.
<br><br>The sound of the zither was carried into the ears.
<br><br>The mood of it immediately pulled Xu Mozhu back to a long, long time ago.
<br><br>There was a time when Xu Mozhu, the renowned Sword King of the Royal Sword Sect, was just a young boy from a humble background who could have imagined that he would one day become a martial arts practitioner.
<br><br>Whenever he had trouble supporting himself, he would return to the ramshackle house and there would always be a mouthful of hot rice and soup, and the kind old woman would always help him sew his clothes that had come off and wash his shoes that were brand new.
<br><br>"Mo Chu, I believe you are the best!"
<br><br>This phrase used to always echo in his ears, that gradually hunched back, that kind smile and gentle concern, his old mother ......
<br><br>Time goes by, the years fly by.
<br><br>More than a thousand years unknowingly have passed, Xu Mozhu just realized that voice had been blurred in an unknown number of years ago.
<br><br>That soft voice dictated, also long time has not appeared in the mind ......
<br><br>And the once tender teenager, also finally, grew up to become a generation of giant Prime.
<br><br>But she.
<br><br>Is no longer.
<br><br>"Mother."
<br><br>Unknowingly, the sound of the zither has stopped, and Xu Mozhu after a long time came out of his memories, the hall of the Imperial Sword Sect Grand Elder, at this moment is the eyes with tears.
<br><br>"It seems that it is our dog's eye that is low." And at this time, next to Li Jiaxin also came softly voice, "this where is what martial emperor ah, just by this zither zither intent, at least is also a martial zun general existence!"
<br><br>Speaking at the same time, Li Jiaxin also lowered her head and wiped the corner of her eyes.
<br><br>It turns out that the eyes, and do not know when the red, not to mention the sound of the zither touched which memories of her heart.
<br><br>"Martial Zun? No wonder!"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu glanced at Li Jiaxin, strong as Li Jiaxin such a half-step Martial Zong strong person will also be like this, I'm afraid that really only a Martial Zong than a large level of Martial Zong strong person can do it.
<br><br>"Let's go, go and pay our respects." Li Jiaxin took a deep breath, her expression became a lot more solemn, and the tone changed from saying hello before to paying respects.
<br><br>Xu Mo Zhu nodded.
<br><br>The two swept up and dragged their shadows out, flying towards Yi Feng's location.
<br><br>"Ugh, there's practice!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was filled with speechlessness while shaking off his somewhat sore arms, and seemed to hear a sound, and hurriedly looked up to find two figures flying towards him.
<br><br>"Cultivators again?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised, looking at the posture of two people flying and sweeping, his heart also revealed a look of yearning.
<br><br>If his broken system is a little more reliable, now he is afraid that he can also be like this across the four seas, right?
<br><br>However, once again encountered cultivators Yi Feng is not too out of shape, after all, it is not the first time he dealt with cultivators, such as the Luo Lanxue, and this time in the mountains with the sword girl are cultivators.
<br><br>Only, thing was he didn't understand was why they were looking for him?
<br><br>Finally, the two landed in front of him.
<br><br>And Yi Feng also put down the guitar in his hand and stood up.
<br><br>However, the two people who Yi Feng had thought were looking for him for something, suddenly bowed towards him, while a respectful voice came out.
<br><br>"Li Jiaxin."
<br><br>"Xu Mozhu."
<br><br>"Greetings to senior."
<br><br>The two spoke in unison, while carefully gauging the protagonist, surprised to find that even close at hand, still could not detect half a fluctuation in Yi Feng's body ......
<br><br>Can't help but, two people look at each other, the heart are set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>Is it a mortal?
<br><br>This is impossible, the sound of the zither alone will let them fall deep into the zither intent, a mortal can not do.
<br><br>Martial Dignity.
<br><br>Stone hammered!
<br><br>But however, Yi Feng is full of confusion, two martial cultivators flying over to call him senior what the hell, so said: "I'm afraid the two of you are mistaken, I'm not a senior, I'm just a mortal, into the mountain to pick medicine."
<br><br>"Mortal?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words immediately made Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu confused.
<br><br>Did they both get it wrong?
<br><br>The youth in front of them was really just a mortal, a mortal who was highly skilled in the zither?
<br><br>Just when the two of them thought so, Li Jiaxin suddenly saw something and her pupils suddenly shrank, feeling dense shock while also not forgetting to wink at Xu Mozhu at the side.
<br><br>At the word, Xu Mozhu will look at the gaze, also fiercely shivered!
