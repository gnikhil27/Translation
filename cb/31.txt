 Hearing that, just ready to get up and leave Yi Feng's gaze moved.
<br><br>The author of the Dream of the Red Chamber?
<br><br>But it is not himself.
<br><br>I did not expect that this Mao Yun'er is still his own reader, perhaps, the printing of the book may have a little turnaround. After all, now his financial situation is not enough to make ends meet.
<br><br>Sure enough, hearing Mao Yun'er talking about the Dream of the Red Chamber in front of Yi Feng, Mao Lin's face also became wonderful, quickly coughed twice, lightly scolded: "Yun'er, said I am receiving guests, you go out first."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er glanced at Yi Feng, puffed up her small cheeks and withdrew.
<br><br>Seeing Mao Yun'er exit, Mao Lin squeezed out a smile and looked at Yi Feng, smiling, "Master Yi, I'm not going to lie, my daughter is indeed your reader, when reading your Dream of the Red Chamber but forgot to eat!
<br><br>But to say this, his words turned again.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>"She as my Chamber of Commerce Pearl, the body has a great responsibility, all day to spend their minds on some love ah love ah book is really not decent, but also not proper work."
<br><br>"I also told you plainly, I do not want to help you print you this this what supreme treasure, also partly because my daughter, because you this book once out, she will be addicted to it again, so also hope that you bear." First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng nodded, did not say more, then ready to get up and leave.
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Mao Lin shouted again.
<br><br>Yi Feng stopped walking and looked back at him.
<br><br>Mao Lin got up and walked towards Yi Feng, while waving his hand, his men would walk out and soon brought a jade tray with two rows of gold coins on it, fearing that there were hundreds of them.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him in confusion.
<br><br>"As you saw just now, my daughter is looking for you, the original author." Mao Lin handed the jade tray to Yi Feng and then said, "Don't tell your identity in front of my daughter, here are one hundred gold coins, take it."
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned slightly and looked at the jade tray.
<br><br>With slight hesitation, he reached out and took only ten gold coins from it, then said, "These ten are the money for the herbs last time, the rest, it's not necessary."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng turned around and left.
<br><br>There is no need to say anything more.
<br><br>At the door, met the waiting Mao Yun'er, Yi Feng politely nodded, as a respect and gratitude to the reader grandfather, food and clothing parents.
<br><br>That's all.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Mao Yun'er went back to Mao Lin.
<br><br>"Father, you promised to take me to introduce the Red Chamber Dream author, how come there is no news so far." Mao Yun'er pouted her red lips and pouted.
<br><br>"Yun'er, you'd better learn business from the seniors of the Chamber of Commerce, what are you doing reading these unprofessional books?" Mao Lin scolded softly.
<br><br>"Business business business, you know you want me to business, I simply do not like business well, besides, even to business I read books also do not affect ah!" Mao Yuner chopped her jade feet and said angrily.
<br><br>"You say this is useless, you can not see him, he should also not be in the book." Mao Lin said with a stern face.
<br><br>"Why?" Mao Yun'er said anxiously.
<br><br>"A poor village boy, if I hadn't helped him last time, how would he have been able to publish a book?" Mao Lin said contemptuously: "Besides, it won't make much profit for the Chamber of Commerce, so I won't cooperate with him in the future."
<br><br>"But, but the sales of Dream of the Red Chamber are obviously very good, and the Chamber has made a lot of money from it." Mao Yun'er said reluctantly, "Why don't we cooperate with him anymore?"
<br><br>"Although it is true that there are a lot of profits, but it is not the focus of our Chamber of Commerce, compared to the focus, these profits are also too meager." Mao Lin explained with a serious face, "And now it is a critical period of competition with the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce does not allow to divert its mind."
<br><br>Seeming to see Mao Yun'er still want to say something, he waved his hand majestically and drank: "Well, I still have things to do, you guys take the lady back to her room to rest."
<br><br>No matter how Mao Yun'er struggled, the two underlings took Mao Yun'er straight down.
<br><br>After Yi Feng walked out of the Chamber of Commerce, the autumn breeze hit him, and his figure rather looked a bit down.
<br><br>Life.
<br><br>It's not easy anywhere!
<br><br>It seems to want to publish a book to make money, only to be able to think of another way ah!
<br><br>Just walked to the door of the martial arts school, and saw two familiar figures, they two a large and a small, is sitting in front of the steps of the martial arts school, hands on the chin waiting for something.
<br><br>It was Luo Lanxue and Yin Luoli of the Qingshan Sect.
<br><br>They are originally cultivators, extraordinary temperament natural beauty, body and plump and beautiful, passers-by have cast their eyes.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng return, the two women's pretty faces showed joy and greeted them.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue bowed, but her gaze did not dare to look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yin Luo Li, on the contrary, was a curious baby sizing up Yi Feng, because she had heard more than once from her master and sister that this person in front of her was a supreme master, and that she must be polite and respectful when she saw him.
<br><br>"It's the two of you."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and asked with a smile, "Where is old brother Qingshan, why didn't he come."
<br><br>"Master ...... my uncle he recently recuperated at home, specially asked us two to come to see sir first." Luo Lanxue extended a delicately wrapped basket from her hand and said softly, "This is the fruit picked from the mountain, uncle asked us to give it to sir."
<br><br>"You're welcome, you're welcome."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and took the fruit basket, nonchalantly opened it and looked at it, inside lay several fruits that were as white and crystal as dolls, which looked delicious.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng's smile, Luo Lanxue wasn't so formal anymore.
<br><br>Have to admit, contact with this senior is really comfortable, thinking of this, she also simply nagged with Yi Feng, asked: "Sir where did this come from?"
<br><br>"I ah ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave a bitter smile and said, "idle, wrote a book to subsidize the family, but struggled to find a place to publish."
<br><br>"Mr. published a book to subsidize the family, but can not find a place to publish?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue was slightly shocked.
<br><br>But then it occurred to her that Yi Feng had entered the mortal world to the extreme and had always been reluctant to reveal his identity, which was what caused this confusion.
<br><br>The world of human affairs, food, oil and salt, there is joy and sorrow, there is trouble and confusion, this is the real experience of life ah!
<br><br>For a moment, Luo Lanxue seems to have comprehended something again.
<br><br>Sure enough, every time you get in touch with Mr., there is always an unexpected gain.
<br><br>"Sir, how about we help you?" After slowing down, Luo Lanxue asked again cautiously.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes faintly lit up.
<br><br>"It's like this, Luo Li's father is the president of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, why don't we go over to him together?" Luo Lanxue explained, after all, Mr. entered the mortal world, she used the mortal way of going through the relationship to help him, it should not break the rules.
<br><br>"That would be great."
<br><br>Yi Feng's gray mood was suddenly swept away, it's really a village of dark flowers!
