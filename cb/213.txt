Finally, the sound of footsteps came.
<br><br>The crowd snapped their heads up to look.
<br><br>A white-robed figure, with a gentle smile, slowly walked out.
<br><br>He was out of the ordinary, extraordinary, dashing and elegant, his eyes clear and moving, especially that light smile, giving people an irresistible affinity, giving people a very comfortable feeling.
<br><br>"Is he the one who composed the song?"
<br><br>Book qin painting beautiful eyes dumbfounded looking at this young man, red lips slightly open.
<br><br>Before Yi Feng came out, she had countless times in her mind to conceptualize what kind of style the person who composed the song was.
<br><br>And the person in front of her, with the perfect image she had in mind, fits perfectly.
<br><br>The person who can compose such a divine song should be this kind of person!
<br><br>The fifth long sky and Yun Xian Que and others were also shocked, because they originally thought that this supreme expert was a flowery old man.
<br><br>But what they didn't expect was that he was actually so young! One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>And its the latter's body, they also could not feel the slightest cultivation, just like a mortal.
<br><br>Of course, can one blow will Jiang Yu flying ashes annihilation of the great power, the crowd will not be foolish to really think that he is mortal.
<br><br>Rather, the cultivation of this person, converge completely so they do not detect the slightest.
<br><br>This also confirms Lu Qingshan's previous caution.
<br><br>This is really a return to the basics, living here in seclusion to feel the ordinary life.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>The crowd bowed in unspoken agreement.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"You're welcome, you're welcome."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled gently, originally thinking that the one looking for him was the farmer or the pig killer from whichever street.
<br><br>Now look, the man is handsome, the woman is pretty, even a few old men are dressed extraordinary, it seems that these people who came are big families.
<br><br>I also do not know, what they are looking for themselves, and so polite.
<br><br>"Sir, my daughter Shuqin painting, heard that you composed the tune, so I came here in admiration." Shu Qinhua said respectfully.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we came here in admiration because of the tune of sir."
<br><br>The rest of the people also remembered Lu Qingshan's reminder and saw the situation and echoed Shu Qinhua's words.
<br><br>"Oh, so that's how it is, come in and sit down."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled in a sudden realization, did not think that he played a few songs at the door every day, there are still people who came to the door in admiration.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Excellent people, want to low-key can not ah!
<br><br>Several people followed Yi Feng and walked towards the martial arts school with excited faces.
<br><br>And after they entered, a figure not far from the door was already dumbfounded.
<br><br>"This kid, this kid actually, actually ......"
<br><br>He was none other than Yu Wujie, who had escaped from the tiger's mouth, and at this moment, he straight felt like he couldn't breathe.
<br><br>Because just now he, all the conversation at the door, all opened into the ears.
<br><br>He never thought that Peng Ying's wasteful childhood friend was actually an unconcealed supreme master?
<br><br>He was the one who had directly killed Jiang Yu just now?
<br><br>Even the pride of the heavens like Yun Xian Que and the Fifth Longkong and the others were only worthy of respect and deference in front of him?
<br><br>There was also his old ancestor of the Castle Peak Sect as well ......
<br><br>Reminded him of that terrifying kitchen knife, it seems to have been obtained from a senior person who runs a martial arts school ......
<br><br>This comes to mind.
<br><br>But is not this one?
<br><br>"What to do la!"
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie is about to cry, he and this one can not be less contradictory, now looking back, he was arrogantly jumping in front of the king of Yan ah!
<br><br>"It's over, it's over, I have to run, hurry up and leave this place."
<br><br>He cried and crawled, ready to flee, because if this one is looking for him to settle scores, it must be like pinching ants to get him?
<br><br>However, however.
<br><br>He just ran a few steps, a furious figure, then stopped him.
<br><br>It was Lu Qingshan who had hastily retired from Yi Feng's place.
<br><br>The reason why he hastily retreated, for Yu Wujie.
<br><br>With his news intelligence how could he not know that it was this Yu Wujie, who had overheard the music score from Mr. and brought it to the ancient tomb.
<br><br>Thereby allowing Jiang Yu ran to the martial arts school, disturbing the life of Yi Feng reclusive into the mortal!
<br><br>"Old ancestor you ......"
<br><br>Yu Wujie just shouted out, the old ancestor of Castle Peak raised his palm and slapped it on his face.
<br><br>"Ah! Old ancestor why are you doing this, I am Yu Wujie ah, you hit the wrong person, is there any misunderstanding ah, I am an outstanding disciple of your Castle Peak Sect ah!" Yu Wujie wailed as he held his swollen face.
<br><br>"Distinguished disciple?"
<br><br>"And why?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan was furious and raised his palm and slapped him again.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie emitted a pig-killing scream, lying miserably on the ground.
<br><br>"You don't want to give you a chance, last time you offended Mr., I spared your life because of the face of the third elder, but I didn't expect that this time you are not open-minded, dare to steal the score of Mr., and also brought the trouble to Mr., what is intolerable!
<br><br>Lu Qingshan stepped on Yu Wujie's chest with one foot.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>The sternum was shattered.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>Yu Wujie frantically wailed, his mouth begged for mercy: "Old ancestor I was wrong, I was wrong, forgive me, give me a chance, I'll go to Yi Feng that little ...... no, Mr. Yi Feng to plead guilty, the rest of my life I'll work for him as a cow and horse to pay back, please forgive me ah!"
<br><br>"As a horse and cattle to pay for the sin?"
<br><br>"Just by you?"
<br><br>"You're a piece of trash, you're worthy of being a horse and a cow for Mr.... How did you have the courage to say such words?"
<br><br>The furious Lu Qingshan grabbed Yu Wujie and slapped him with a series of slaps.
<br><br>This series of slaps directly turned Yu Wujie into a pig's head, spitting out blood and unconscious, but his mouth still forgot to beg for mercy, "Let me go, old ancestor, I was raised by you, I have given a lot for the Castle Peak Sect over the years, I am an outstanding disciple of the Castle Peak Sect, there is no merit but hard work!"
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's face was full of disdain, and said soberly: "You are not worthy of living in this world, go to hell and repent!"
<br><br>Saying that, Lu Qingshan grabbed Yu Wujie's neck and slowly squeezed down with force.
<br><br>Yu Wujie's voice stopped abruptly, lost his body suction, and went soft on the ground.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>With the accompanying kick, kicked Yu Wujie's body to the side of the sewage ditch, Lu Qingshan then gave up.
<br><br>Looking at the martial arts school not far away.
<br><br>He took a deep breath and bowed with a face full of respect.
<br><br>He understood.
<br><br>This matter sir has long known, and did not say it straight out, is to give him Lu Qingshan a chance to deal with himself.
<br><br>In the martial arts school.
<br><br>Book qin painting and other people have long been unable to speak.
<br><br>Because the treasures in this martial arts museum, is too much, so much that they dazzled.
<br><br>Such a tremendous gesture of a supreme master was simply unheard of.
<br><br>Afterwards, the crowd sat down with restraint at Yi Feng's invitation.
<br><br>The good thing was that Yi Feng's appearance, which was always full of gentle smiles, and the affinity that he spoke through, made them relaxed a lot.
<br><br>Even with this appearance, it was hard to imagine that it was this one that had killed Jiang Yu, who was one step short of entering the Martial Emperor realm, in seconds.
<br><br>"Oh Expanse!"
<br><br>Just then, Yi Feng frowned slightly, and his body subconsciously straightened up a bit.
<br><br>"That Miss Yun, can you get a piece of paper for me behind you?" Yi Feng said in a somewhat unnatural voice.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que smiled and looked towards the back, and indeed found a layer of rice paper stacked on the cabinet behind.
<br><br>She picked up a piece as instructed, and her eyes widened at once.
<br><br>The rest of the people saw this, also fierce will look over, immediately felt suffocated.
<br><br>The not too small rice paper, is painted with a lifelike qilin, when the crowd's eyes cast over, the qilin's gleaming pupils seem to emit an endless pressure.
<br><br>Let the crowd's soul tremble!
<br><br>The painting of the qilin, actually has a spiritual sense, there is life?
<br><br>Phew!
<br><br>The crowd felt dumbfounded, the value of this painting alone, I'm afraid it crushed the emperor's treasures.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que felt his palms tremble, and with both hands solemnly handed this piece of rice paper to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Oh, not too kind, my stomach is a bit uncomfortable, excuse me for the moment, feel free to look at it yourselves."
<br><br>While speaking, Yi Feng, under the dumbfounded gaze of the crowd, tore the rice paper in his hand into two halves, pinched it into a ball, and then walked towards the toilet at the back ......
