Bai Lengxi opened his mouth.
<br><br>Lowering his head to speak.
<br><br>The identity of the Seven Fate Martial Emperors are not qualified to know, is it, is it immortal?
<br><br>But the immortal road has been broken, where does the immortal come from ......
<br><br>For a time, Yi Feng's strength and cultivation level became a mystery in her heart.
<br><br>"Yo-ho."
<br><br>"Little Gongzi Zhong!"
<br><br>At this time, the eight old men who were full of cold light just now suddenly changed their painting style and transmitted their voices towards Zhong Qing who was walking in the distance with a look of flattery.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Let Bai Lengxi fell to the ground.
<br><br>If Yi Feng is strong, these eight old men can be said to be respectful to him, but why treat Zhong Qing also like this? One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>You should know that she had spent two or three months with Zhong Qing, and she knew more than anyone else about Zhong Qing's situation.
<br><br>It is completely a mortal with no cultivation.
<br><br>And Zhong Qing himself said the same thing.
<br><br>So, eight ten life martial emperors have the need to show this pandering look to a mortal?
<br><br>Is it because Zhong Qing is Yi Feng's disciple?
<br><br>That can't be!
<br><br>Where is the pride of a Martial Emperor?
<br><br>Just when she was wondering, Zhong Qing walked over.
<br><br>And for Bai Lengxi, Zhong Qing ignored it.
<br><br>This woman, he did not like at all, always a cultivator high and mighty posture, plus the incident just now, so Zhong Qing intended to draw a clear line with this woman.
<br><br>"A few old men, your hands are itching, accompany me to practice a little more!" Zhong Qing said towards the eight old men.
<br><br>"Aiya little gongzi Zhong, your hands are itching again, since you don't mind us old people being useless, let's practice with you!" Several old men laughed in unison at the same time.
<br><br>It just so happened that the street was deserted, so Zhong Qing and the eight old men took up their stance.
<br><br>And for Bai Lengxi on the side, they directly ignored it.
<br><br>"The usual rules, you eight beat me together, so that I can improve improve my coping ability." Zhong Qing laughed, while picking up a small wooden stick from the steps at the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Good, good, old rules."
<br><br>All eight old men nodded tacitly, some raised the flat sticks in their hands, and some picked up the cigarette sticks in their hands.
<br><br>"Come on!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing bent down and beckoned toward the eight old men.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>The eight old men looked at each other in unison, and the weapons of various colors in their hands moved at the same time and enveloped towards Zhong Qing from all sides.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi, who originally did not know what the hell name these few people were up to, saw this scene and his face changed violently, filled with disbelief.
<br><br>As a bystander and a Seventh Life Martial Emperor cultivator, she could see the moment these eight old men made their move that these eight old men's seemingly disorganized and unstructured attacks had a great deal to offer.
<br><br>First of all, there was the coordination.
<br><br>The eight people's attack completely cut off all of Zhong Qing's retreat, eight directions, completely covering the full range.
<br><br>In addition, the power.
<br><br>Their attacks looked like mortal brawls, powerless, but in fact, each one of them contained a strong dao power in their attacks.
<br><br>The attack of the power of the Great Dao is much more terrifying than that seemingly powerful attack.
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi was filled with confusion.
<br><br>Such an attack, how could Zhong Qing possibly catch it?
<br><br>He was just a mortal with no cultivation!
<br><br>The combined attack of eight Ten Destiny Martial Emperors, the Great Dao descending, let alone a mortal, even if one were to put anyone from the Immortal River Continent in the middle, I'm afraid that they would be instantly killed in seconds.
<br><br>Just at the moment when she was struggling to figure it out, Zhong Qing in the middle suddenly shouted out.
<br><br>"Slashing Chop."
<br><br>"Chop Chop ......"
<br><br>"Heyha."
<br><br>At the same time the wooden stick in his hand moved.
<br><br>Along with the fall of Zhong Qing's voice, the onlooker Bai Lengxi's eyes widened and his mouth couldn't help but cry out in shock.
<br><br>"Broken ......"
<br><br>"It actually broke?"
<br><br>For a moment, she felt like she couldn't breathe, and it was like a fish thorn was stuck in her throat.
<br><br>It was because she saw with her own eyes that Zhong Qing wielded the wooden stick and instantly cracked the attacks of the eight people, while dissipating the power of the Great Dao contained in the attacks of the eight people.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>Her mouth drew a cold breath.
<br><br>It felt like this world and its unreality, completely overturned her thinking.
<br><br>Because what just happened was even more shocking than seeing a newborn baby, a small palm slapping away a big mountain.
<br><br>"Oops, Little Prince Zhong, we lost again."
<br><br>Several old men said with faces full of shame.
<br><br>"Old uncle you guys are too polite, but ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Zhong Qing scratched his head and said embarrassedly, "But a few old uncles will have to work hard next time, although your siege this time looks much more brilliant than last time, it's still too easy to break."
<br><br>"Eh eh, okay, we'll try our best, we'll definitely try our best."
<br><br>Instead of getting angry, the eight old men looked like they were being taught, nodding their heads like chickens pecking rice in front of Zhong Qing.
<br><br>However, seeing this scene, Bai Lengxi's heart was pounding.
<br><br>There was a bitter smile on her pretty face.
<br><br>Because at this moment, she had to admit a fact.
<br><br>That is, Zhong Qing, the Tie Bean that she thought she was in control of, was actually an existence that people looked up to.
<br><br>It was no wonder.
<br><br>No wonder these eight old men were so polite to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Originally, it wasn't just because Zhong Qing was Yi Feng's disciple, but because Zhong Qing himself, was also outrageously strong.
<br><br>This in turn made her can't help but envision that Zhong Qing is strong to this extent, then the master behind him ......
<br><br>She did not dare to think any further.
<br><br>But at least, it's immortal!
<br><br>Even if the path to immortality has been broken.
<br><br>The funny thing is that she actually still presumed to rip people off, and even kept thinking that this master and disciple were the bottom mortals.
<br><br>It turned out that she was the clown who made people feel ridiculous.
<br><br>"A few old folks, you guys chat first, I'll go back to the martial arts school to help Master wash his socks." Zhong Qing smiled nervously.
<br><br>"Good, be my guest, young master Zhong."
<br><br>The eight old men watched Zhong Qing leave.
<br><br>After Zhong Qing left, the eight men's faces sank and they redirected their gaze to Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's heart thudded.
<br><br>Lowered her head again.
<br><br>"See?"
<br><br>Old man Zhou said leisurely.
<br><br>"Look, saw."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi hastily answered in fear.
<br><br>"So, you, a small Seventh Life Martial Emperor, are qualified to pose here as if you are superior?" Old man Zhou questioned again.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face was bitter.
<br><br>Not even half a word dared to say.
<br><br>But in his heart, he was also a bit aggrieved.
<br><br>The devil knew that this pair of master and disciple were such oddballs, obviously bullish to the point of explosion, but they had to call themselves mortals to pretend to be pigs and eat tigers.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It's also her own fault for being blind and blaming herself!
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>"Let us see you appear in Pingjiang City again, exterminate your nine clans."
<br><br>With a wave of Old Man Zhou's palm, an attack suffused with the power of the Great Dao landed on Bai Lengxi's chest, knocking her hard out of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Within the confines of the East Victory Continent.
<br><br>Ye Bei, Shake Heavenly Que, Guan Yunpeng and others were running around busily.
<br><br>"According to senior's previous instructions, in addition to people reliable, the power can not be too weak, so I guessed that the minimum cultivation has to be Martial Zun, I'm afraid it's enough to qualify ah!"
<br><br>Ye Bei said solemnly.
<br><br>"Yes, but the martial dweller is also not good to invite ah!"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que nodded and said: "And the entire Eastern Victory martial dwellers, combined actually not many."
<br><br>"Hmph, success is in the hands of others, sir has given us such a great opportunity, we have to help him with these things."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng said, "I just thought back, I've also known a bit of close friends over the years, some are working as patriarchs, some are working as elders, I'll try to pull them all over."
<br><br>"Good, I also know a few close friends who are patriarchs, I'll go and pull them over together." Shaking Heavenly Que likewise made up his mind and said.
<br><br>Immediately, several people split up and took action.
<br><br>Doing their best to help Yi Feng pull the Martial Exalted toilers.
