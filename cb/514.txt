The two of them soon arrived over the sealing place.
<br><br>"What do you think, senior sister?"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin asked.
<br><br>His face was quite worried.
<br><br>After all, it was the place where the ancient fierce beasts were sealed, and this kind of seal was definitely not an ordinary seal.
<br><br>"Senior brother is overly worried, all the formations cannot be separated from the word calculation."
<br><br>"As long as you can calculate accurately, finding the answer is a breeze."
<br><br>Mo Tianji raised her proud chin.
<br><br>"Senior sister, is that math you learned really that godly?" Jia Jia Qin asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>"Math encompasses everything, can break everything, a small formation is naturally at hand, even cracking it has many ways to add, subtract, multiply, divide, multiply, open, etc. etc. ......" 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"And really, there are infinite kinds of operations on the set of natural numbers, in abstract algebra operations are defined as a binary function, and since there are infinite kinds of binary functions, there are also infinite kinds of operations."
<br><br>Mo Tianji patiently explained.
<br><br>But Jia Jia Qin's brain had long been confused.
<br><br>"Sister, this is too complicated, I can't understand half of it, but you can understand so much, you should have learned a lot in mathematics, right?" Jia Jia Qin asked.
<br><br>"What are you thinking?"
<br><br>Mo Tianji could not help but smile bitterly.
<br><br>"I've been studying for so long, I haven't even learned the skin, and if I were to go by my grade in this area, I'd be a junior high school at most today!"
<br><br>"Upwards, there are more advanced high school, university, expert, professor ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>Mo Tianji beauty eyes can't help but reveal a look of longing.
<br><br>Then, Mo Tianji easily took Jia Jia Qin to break the formation and silently entered the sealed place.
<br><br>"Senior sister, you are so powerful." Seeing that the seal was broken so easily, Jia Jia Qin said with a face full of fervor.
<br><br>"This is nothing, although this formation is difficult, but after so long, the power has long been ten to one." Mo Tianji lightly explained.
<br><br>"This is also very powerful senior sister." Jia Jia Qin said excitedly: "And you are still only a junior high school, I really do not know if to the high school college you just said, and what is a terrifying as the realm."
<br><br>Mo Tianji smiled helplessly.
<br><br>That kind of realm, also can only slowly, slowly accumulate.
<br><br>Just at this moment, within the small space of the sealing place, a violent gale swept up.
<br><br>At the same time there was a strong aura awakening.
<br><br>At once, the two Mo Tianji felt a strong sense of crisis coming on, as if there was a pair of eyes staring at them in the dark.
<br><br>"Senior brother, are you sure?"
<br><br>Mo Tianji asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Don't worry, senior sister, please follow me closely."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin smiled easily and then walked towards the front ignoring the intimidating pressure.
<br><br>Mo Tianji, on the other hand, followed closely behind Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>After all, she was only able to break the formation, and she could not help with the matter of subduing the demonic beast.
<br><br>But in the face of such an ancient beast, he also wants to see a good look, her brother will be how to subdue.
<br><br>The two of them followed the yellow sand all the way through.
<br><br>When they finally reached the end, Jia Jia Qin gave a beat to his feet and leisurely shouted, "Don't hide, come out!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Two tiny humans actually dare to barge into my territory, are they desperate for their lives?"
<br><br>A pair of scarlet eyes appeared in the sky, staring at the two from above.
<br><br>"When you say that, think about yourself first!"
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin just laughed gently.
<br><br>"The seal that has sealed you for several eras was broken, if you were in perfect condition now, why would you still be hiding inside the gutter and threatening us?"
<br><br>"So it can only be said that your current state is very bad, even if the seal is broken, you do not dare to go out."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>The voice sank.
<br><br>It was slightly panicked.
<br><br>Obviously its current state was completely stated by Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>"Who the hell are you people?"
<br><br>"And what is the purpose of coming here?"
<br><br>The pair of eyes stared deadly at the two, asking in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Don't panic, we won't hurt you." Jia Jia Qin said, "This time, I came here on purpose to find you, to make a deal with you."
<br><br>"Humph, I don't need to have any deal with humans." The voice said icily.
<br><br>"Making a deal or not is not up to you, unless you don't want your bloodline to continue." Jia Jia Qin remained unhurried and said.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The voice suddenly moved and suddenly became extremely excited.
<br><br>"You have a way to be able to perpetuate my bloodline?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin said indifferently.
<br><br>"I don't believe it."
<br><br>"I'll prove it to you."
<br><br>"How can you prove it?"
<br><br>"This is an egg, an ordinary egg." Jia Jia Qin reached out and pulled out an egg with chicken shit still on its shell.
<br><br>"I naturally know it's an ordinary egg!"
<br><br>Huang Tian concealed his dark breath in a sweep, and a deep voice came out, "But what can an ordinary egg represent?"
<br><br>"I was able to use this ordinary egg to hatch a chick with the Nine Heavenly Divine Phoenix bloodline." Jia Jia Qin said confidently.
<br><br>"That's impossible."
<br><br>Huang Tian said in a deep voice.
<br><br>This was simply a heavenly fantasy.
<br><br>"You don't have the knowledge."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin gave him a blank look.
<br><br>"According to my master's biography book On Hybridization Techniques, theoretically any species is able to be mated out."
<br><br>"If you don't believe me, you can take a look."
<br><br>With that, Jia Jia Qin's storage ring moved slightly, accompanied by a "clucking" sound, an old hen was lifted out by him.
<br><br>"And see how I hatch."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin smiled faintly.
<br><br>Then he drove the old hen to hatch the egg with shit on it.
<br><br>"Senior brother, can't you get a cleaner egg?" On the side, Mo Tianji frowned and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Senior sister, that's not good enough, the chicken shit on this egg is more likely to make this old hen have more love and affinity for this egg so that it can hatch out faster."
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin smiled faintly.
<br><br>Not even caring about the half-hearted gaze above his head, he chestily sat down in place and waited for the egg to hatch ......
