"But you have to remember that not only does the gentleman himself return to the basics, but so do his things."
<br><br>"For example, this bowl in my hand, when you don't use the power to push it, it looks like it's just a bowl."
<br><br>"But if you use the power to push, it is still a bowl!"
<br><br>"But it's not an ordinary bowl!"
<br><br>"So hurry up and take it, take it!"
<br><br>At the request of the two Human Immortal seniors.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was hard forced to accept more than twenty pieces of top-grade immortal weapons.
<br><br>Kitchen utensils, armed to the teeth.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was so excited that he wept.
<br><br>There was a time when a single intermediate level immortal weapon would have caused her to fight for it.
<br><br>And now. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Top-grade immortal weapon, as long as she wants, that is a sentence not enough there ......
<br><br>But she did not dare to float.
<br><br>She understands that all this change started with the man she saw on the island.
<br><br>She can now have all this, all is given by him.
<br><br>The next half month.
<br><br>Jiang to all sink their hearts and minds into the construction of the teleportation port.
<br><br>Under her arrangement, a formation was arranged near the teleportation port and a palace was moved and erected at the entrance, making the entrance right on the palace square.
<br><br>She thought.
<br><br>In case the gentleman comes out with something, there is also a good place to stay.
<br><br>As for the security matters.
<br><br>She did not worry about it.
<br><br>Really one day there are not open-minded to break in to mess things up, think of the 1,000 human immortals and a hundred earth immortals inside ......
<br><br>And at this time in the immortal river continent.
<br><br>But there is a big event happening.
<br><br>Countless experts, foreigners, launched an attack towards the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>Just when they thought they could trample down the Heaven and Earth Gate, a monk came out across the sky with a broom.
<br><br>While saying Amitabha Buddha, it's not good for you to hold swords like this, he killed all these attackers.
<br><br>After a battle, not even a single intact body could be found.
<br><br>In the black hall.
<br><br>Behind the curtain.
<br><br>The messenger who couldn't see his real face clearly, his voice was trembling.
<br><br>"Trapped, trapped, this person is really good."
<br><br>He spoke in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>When he first heard that the people on the Heaven and Earth Gate Island had teleported away on a large scale, he had thought that they had wimped out and retreated, abandoning this place, which was why he had sent people to fight on the island, trying to use the formation to take back the Qi luck.
<br><br>But who knows.
<br><br>This is a shocking conspiracy.
<br><br>It was a trap set against them.
<br><br>It looked like the Heaven and Earth Gate was already empty, but in fact it had already been set up, waiting for them to fall into the trap.
<br><br>"I have underestimated the master of this Heaven and Earth Gate."
<br><br>"Really good tactics!"
<br><br>The messenger said in a hoarse voice: "It seems that this person, who has already completely confronted us, is going to fight with us."
<br><br>"Emissary restrain your anger."
<br><br>The subordinate next to him said respectfully: "Although this person used a scheme to win a small wave against us, but for us, it actually does not hurt, but on the contrary can let us figure out the enemy make good use of the scheme, in the future fight we will be alert, not to eat a bigger loss, it is also a good thing."
<br><br>"You're right."
<br><br>A voice came from behind the curtain, "Let them bounce around for a while longer, after the qi of the other realms is gathered, then come together to deal with them, by then in front of absolute strength, any of their schemes, are vain."
<br><br>"The messenger is highly intelligent."
<br><br>"By the way, is there any trace of the extinction?" The messenger asked again.
<br><br>"There has been no trace of the extermination." The subordinate said, "If not for his soul lamp still being there, I would have thought he was dead."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"What the hell is this Exterminator up to?" An angry voice came from the ambassador, then ordered, "Continue to go find it for me."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>The small island was not far away.
<br><br>Perdition had been sitting here in a coiled position for almost a full year.
<br><br>During this year, he had shrunk his aura to its most concealed state and his anger was compressed to its most subtle level.
<br><br>After all, this was near the enemy's lair.
<br><br>He shouldered the great responsibility of guarding the formation and could not afford to be sloppy.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>He opened his eyes.
<br><br>Turning his gaze to the formation that was still running on one side, he frowned slightly.
<br><br>"Have the nine lords not returned yet?"
<br><br>Just as he finished speaking, he noticed a chattering sound coming from his ears.
<br><br>Tilted his head to look.
<br><br>Only to find that on his shoulder, I do not know when, a swallow's nest has been installed, the small swallow pooped out to stain his neck.
<br><br>But the world is not angry but happy.
<br><br>Swallows nesting.
<br><br>A good omen.
<br><br>"Is this a sign that the nine lords will soon return?"
<br><br>He had a look of surprise on his face.
<br><br>Hope flickered back in his eyes after he had been somewhat discouraged.
<br><br>"Die waiting."
<br><br>Determination flickered in his eyes and clenched his fist to strike.
<br><br>......
<br><br>That said, Jiang Zhi.
<br><br>Only after setting up the teleportation array port, she finally chose this day to go back to the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent.
<br><br>"Your Holiness, going back at this time of the day?"
<br><br>Jiang Shang said with a gloomy face: "News came from there, Soga Rentu has married the daughter of the Desolate Continent Lord, and now the wedding has just been completed, not only the Desolate Continent Lord's daughter Desolate Qinglian is in the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent, even the Desolate Continent Lord himself, is now in the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent before leaving ah!"
<br><br>"If we go there at this time, won't it be a wolf entering a tiger's mouth?"
<br><br>"No need to say, just go back now, grab them and get rid of them, we still have to come back to guard the transmission array."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi said expressionlessly.
<br><br>?
<br><br>????
<br><br>Jiang Shang and the others were speechless.
<br><br>You said that.
<br><br>As if going back to take revenge was like visiting a relative, to put it so lightly?
<br><br>Intermediate level immortal weapon.
<br><br>Soga Rentu.
<br><br>Desolate Green Lotus.
<br><br>The Lord of the Desolate Continent.
<br><br>Which one of them is not a big mountain overhead?
<br><br>I really want to ask.
<br><br>Where did they get the confidence?
<br><br>It always feels like their venerable lord, after being locked out of Dark Shadow Island this time, has become somewhat abnormal.
<br><br>What's more, even if he succeeded in his revenge, shouldn't he continue to be the continental lord of the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent, and come here to guard the transmission array?
<br><br>Jiang Zhi did not speak.
<br><br>Instead, he glanced at Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong next to him.
<br><br>There are two great immortals in.
<br><br>What does the Lord of the Desolate Continent count for?
<br><br>What's more, she still had more than twenty top-grade immortal weapons on her body.
<br><br>As for the Continent Lord of the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent ......
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
<br><br>A continental lord of the lower three continents, she already does not care at all!
<br><br>Seeing that Jiang Zhi was so insistent, Jiang Shang and the others had no choice but to give up.
<br><br>And just then, one of the subordinates' eyes turned.
<br><br>He left quietly.
<br><br>When no one was around, he took out the voice transmission jade slip.
<br><br>"Subordinate Bai Fan, meet the continent master."
<br><br>"En, is there any news?" At the other end of the jade slip, a voice came out, if Jiang Zhi was here, he would be able to recognize that this person was none other than Soga Rentu.
<br><br>"Report to the Lord, since Jiang Zhi came out, he ordered us to guard a transmission array, and I do not know why." Bai Fan said in a low voice.
<br><br>"Teleportation array?"
<br><br>"What teleportation array?"
<br><br>Soga Rentu asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I don't know what kind of transmission array, but from my subordinates' observation, it should just be a small transmission array, so this continental lord doesn't need to be too concerned about it." Bai Fan said.
<br><br>"Then why did you send me a message?" Soga Rentu asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I am sending a letter to tell the continent lord that Jiang Zhi is ready to move back to the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent today to seek revenge on you, the continent lord!" Bai Fan said.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Soga Rentu revealed a surprised look and sneered, "Let's not talk about whether she is my opponent today, don't you know that Qinglian and my father-in-law are at the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent at this moment?"
<br><br>"He came at this time, isn't he looking for death?"
<br><br>"This, my subordinate doesn't know either."
<br><br>Bai Fan said in a low voice.
<br><br>"This, something is not right."
<br><br>Soga Rentu said in a deep voice: "With Jiang Zhi's character, she never fights unsure battles, if she had no cards, she would never make such a decision.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"Say what people."
<br><br>"It's two human immortals!"
<br><br>"?"
<br><br>Soga Rentu froze, "Two human immortals?"
<br><br>"You're not mistaken?"
