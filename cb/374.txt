At this moment Su Xuanjun he is seeing, seven or eight people tied with ropes, will be a strange shape of the statue to carry over.
<br><br>"Slowly slowly, do not bump into."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was chatting with Monk Kunpeng, saw this and hurriedly ran over and yelled.
<br><br>This strange statue he has a pair, he picked up from outside, usually placed at the entrance of the martial arts school, as a stone lion to strengthen the martial arts school.
<br><br>Just look for a long time, Yi Feng did not look good.
<br><br>Strange shape, not to mention, how a look at it is also a thief scary, so then their only role, it became the existence of Yi Feng drying socks, hanging rags, from time to time lazy dog, may also lift the hind legs in there on a bubble of urine.
<br><br>So over time, the top accounted for a layer of moss, looks a little shabby, even with a little odor.
<br><br>Until recently, Yi Feng only remembered the existence of this pair of statues.
<br><br>Get the clan is not?
<br><br>To force the style is not?
<br><br>Thought about polishing the pair of statues, placed on the island after the gate, should still be able to bluff a little. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After all, no one knows what this thing is carved in the end, right?
<br><br>Blind chicken blowing this is some kind of divine beast, should not be questioned.
<br><br>After directing these people to carry one of the statues to the shore, Yi Feng reached out to greet the old man who just rowed past.
<br><br>"Hey, old man come quickly."
<br><br>Seeing this, the old man hurriedly rowed the boat back again and leaned on the shore.
<br><br>"Old man you hold the boat, hold still." Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Yes, sir."
<br><br>The old man used the bamboo pole to hold the raft with dead weight and stabilized it on the shore.
<br><br>Then under Yi Feng's command, a group of people carefully carried the statue toward the raft.
<br><br>"Oops, this thing is still thief heavy."
<br><br>Yi Feng spat out, so he shouted at the monk, "Monk, come and give a hand."
<br><br>"Okay monk."
<br><br>The monk smiled gently, lifted the loose sleeves of his robe and came to help.
<br><br>"This statue, this statue in the end is ......"
<br><br>While on the side, Su Xuanjun's virtual shadow's gaze was always focused on this statue, and a trembling and terrified voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>In the midst of extreme shock, his virtual shadow has also long been unknowingly hidden in the dark, hiding behind a tree.
<br><br>He never thought that first he saw the legendary old man here, and then he saw the monk with a "shiny" appearance.
<br><br>And finally, he saw this mysterious statue here!
<br><br>Almost as soon as he slowed down, his shadow turned into a smoke and disappeared at once.
<br><br>Now, he no longer cared about hatred or not, killing Black Feather or not.
<br><br>As for his individual demon men, they were long forgotten by him to the clouds, only leaving them there full of unbelievable wailing.
<br><br>Continent Lord.
<br><br>How come he suddenly ran away?
<br><br>But just when Su Xuanjun's shadow was about to cross the void back to the Immortal Realm, in the last split second, a voice seemed to reach his ears.
<br><br>"I will definitely come to you."
<br><br>At the same time the voice came, he vaguely saw that there was a figure that cast its gaze over.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's heart thudded.
<br><br>But finally, the projected shadow was retracted, and then stood in place, breathing heavily.
<br><br>"It should be an illusion, right?"
<br><br>"Yes, it should be an illusion, this immortal technique of mine even if the strength is much stronger than mine, it is not seen to be able to detect me."
<br><br>He recalled the words, if any, before he left, and couldn't help but comfort himself.
<br><br>A long, long time before he calmed down.
<br><br>But just as he calmed down, a group of his subordinates flocked over and patted on his back.
<br><br>"Congratulations on the triumphant return of the continental lord."
<br><br>"The continental lord has worked hard."
<br><br>"With the continental lord's horse, that black feather must have been killed."
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"The continental lord is worthy of being a continental lord, crossing the two realms to give Black Feather a direct descend of heavenly might, I'm afraid the dead Black Feather's intestines are turning blue with regret!"
<br><br>Hearing these words, Su Xuanjun's face muscles twitched and clouded.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>A violent rage, directly reprimanded to stop them.
<br><br>This group of unenlightened things, simply which pot is not to mention which pot.
<br><br>Still fucking triumphant return, just now that moment, he almost did not die of fright ......
<br><br>Can't help it, he palm fierce movement, fell to the cloud elephant's neck.
<br><br>"Tell me, tell me what the black feather mutiny is, what the hell is it?"
<br><br>"Yes, it's ......"
<br><br>Cloud elephant face ugly, stammering voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>So he told all that he knew, and Yi Feng and Skeleton Ben Wei, and what happened on top of the island.
<br><br>"Yi Feng is the leader?"
<br><br>"The Yi Feng you are talking about is a monk, or an old man?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Neither, it's a white-robed youth."
<br><br>Yun Xiang hurriedly gave a description of Yi Feng's appearance.
<br><br>"It's him?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's eyelids jumped.
<br><br>He just snapped out of it, he had completely overlooked a person just now under the shock of the old man holding the boat, the monk Kun Peng, and the statue.
<br><br>Now in retrospect, this person is the real terror ah!
<br><br>Because he remembered that the statue was owned for him; the old man who supported the boat also treated him with respect; the monk Kun Peng did not seem to have any objection to his command.
<br><br>And this man, judging from his dress and appearance, was the Yi Feng described by the cloud elephant.
<br><br>It turned out that this person, who had been ignored by him, was the head!
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Su Xuanjun sucked in a breath backwards, incomparably grave now.
<br><br>To be able to make the old man who supported the boat, monk Kunpeng such a character recognized as the head, this white-clothed youth, in the end what kind of terrifying as the character ah!
<br><br>Then will be nervous gaze towards the cloud elephant, asked in a deep voice: "By the way, you still know what news."
<br><br>"But indeed there is still a message, just now in retrospect, to the continental Lord should not be enough evidence!" Yun Xiang said.
<br><br>"What exactly is the news?" Su Xuanjun asked urgently.
<br><br>"That Yi Feng once said loudly that his target seemed to be you, as if saying that he wanted to capture you, the continental lord." Yun Xiang sneered, "Do you think he doesn't know the sky is high, Continent Lord?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The target is me?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's eyes glared.
<br><br>"Indeed."
<br><br>Yun Xiang hurriedly said lightly, "On the contrary, please calm down your anger, Lord of the Continent, there is no need to get angry, the big deal is that Lord of the Continent will destroy him with a little more effort."
<br><br>"After all, with the strength of the Lord of the Continent, it would be easy to take care of this character called Yi Feng?"
<br><br>Yun Xiang nodded and took the opportunity to flatter.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that just as his voice fell, the high and mighty Lord of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, Su Xuanjun, suddenly sat down on his butt.
