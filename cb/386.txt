Almost instantly, the flying boat was smashed into pieces.
<br><br>Six green figures plunged down toward the ground.
<br><br>After landing, the six immediately smashed several large craters out of the ground, raising a burst of sky-rocketing dust.
<br><br>And seeing this scene, the dozens of Martial Emperors chasing behind them immediately stared in disbelief.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This this this ......"
<br><br>"The speed of that flying boat, I'm afraid it's an Immortal level treasure, yet they easily caught up and destroyed it like this, then their strength ......"
<br><br>"At the very least, they are also Immortal level experts!"
<br><br>"What kind of city is this city, how can there be so many experts of this level."
<br><br>"Yes, shouldn't such experts all be in the immortal realm, how come they are all gathered here!"
<br><br>These Martial Emperors who followed behind, most of them were workers recruited by Shake Heavenly Que and the others later, were equally astonished to see this scene. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>When they were in the hall, they felt that the hall was already a super lineup, but compared to the more than 300 people standing in the air in front of them, what does that count for!
<br><br>What makes people think more carefully is ......
<br><br>This city in addition to these three hundred, there will not be other hidden experts?
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>The thought of this, the crowd could not help but chatter their teeth.
<br><br>This time, they were considered to have truly opened their eyes.
<br><br>"Aiya, fighting Martial Emperors is really not a good fight!"
<br><br>At this time, one of those 300 or so, one of the old men couldn't help but sigh: "A little carelessness to use a little more power might kill them."
<br><br>"Yes, this power is really hard to control!" On the side, an aproned woman said.
<br><br>"Luckily, luckily my hand didn't slip, haha."
<br><br>Another man laughed.
<br><br>"All right, all right, hurry up and disperse, my basket has not been sold." Another old man waved his hand and said.
<br><br>"Right, hurry up and disperse, my family's chickens have not been fed yet, go home to feed the chickens." An older woman muttered.
<br><br>The crowd nodded and turned into a stream of light in the sky, and then returned to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Pingjiang City, once again, regained its calm.
<br><br>It was bustling with the sounds of hawking and yelling, as if what had just happened had never happened.
<br><br>The dozens of Martial Emperors also slowed down after they left, and set up the six men in green and rushed back towards the restaurant.
<br><br>"Sir, got them back."
<br><br>"Caught and returned sir."
<br><br>The crowd shouted one after another.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up and he ordered loudly, "You guys search all the goodies on them first, I'll be back after I go to the toilet."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, dozens of Martial Emperors immediately surrounded the six men in green, and in less than a moment, they searched out all the treasures on their bodies, including the goodies inside their storage bags.
<br><br>Seeing these goodies, many people present showed hot eyes.
<br><br>Because these six people are really too fat.
<br><br>All kinds of emperor-quality treasures not to mention, also found one or two immortal-level treasures among them.
<br><br>"These six guys, where in the world did they get so many good things?"
<br><br>"Yeah, I'm a Ninth Life Martial Emperor, these good things are not even seen normally."
<br><br>"Yes, the flying boat that appeared just now is already very strange, I guess they are not small in origin."
<br><br>"So what if they are not small, do they dare to come to Pingjiang City to cause trouble?"
<br><br>"That's true."
<br><br>The crowd murmured and waited for Yi Feng.
<br><br>Although they were all salivating over these treasures, none of them had a small mind.
<br><br>And Yi Feng, who had finished going to the toilet, finally rushed back.
<br><br>"Sir, these are the things that were recovered from the six people, please also decide, sir." The people bowed and said.
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly went over and examined the six people's belongings, also wanted to see what was valuable.
<br><br>The crowd was waiting quietly and silently on the side.
<br><br>In the crowd's gaze, Yi Feng casually picked up a bead and observed it.
<br><br>"Sir this is ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, a Nine Lives Martial Emperor wanted to introduce, this is once recorded imperial treasure waterless bead, it is rumored that with it, can break water at every water, see water as nothing.
<br><br>However, the side of the shake the sky Que glared at him, said in a deep voice: "want you to talk more, sir can not know?"
<br><br>Hearing that, that Nine Lives Martial Emperor hurriedly shut up.
<br><br>And after looking at the beads, Yi Feng picked up another unreadable talisman paper, drawn in a fancy way, and after looking at it for half a day, he couldn't make out what it was.
<br><br>Then he dropped his gaze on top of a wooden box, drumming for a while, but also did not find any role.
<br><br>Finally, after the same check, Yi Feng's face gloomy down, raised his head and asked: "So half a day of search, just search out such a little garbage things?"
<br><br>Yi Feng this sentence, immediately asked the people present collectively dumbfounded.
<br><br>Just a little junk?
<br><br>Big brother, this was more than a dozen emperor-grade treasures, as well as two immortal-grade treasures!
<br><br>Although I don't know where these six people came from, every one of these treasures can cause a sensation when they are taken out, but in your mouth, they have become garbage things?
<br><br>Do you have to be so high-minded?
<br><br>One of the wall builders finally couldn't help himself and said softly, "Sir, are you looking away, this is not some junk?"
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>"What do you need to say?"
<br><br>Seeing this, all the people present glared at that person, and a scolding voice came out.
<br><br>"All right."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and did not blame him.
<br><br>Instead, he sighed in his heart.
<br><br>Poor people are poor people after all, ah, everything looks like a treasure, but what use can these trash things be?
<br><br>Far from a few gold coins to practical.
<br><br>"People, after all, the eyes should be a little higher, how high the heart, how high the sky, especially men, when there are big ambitions!"
<br><br>He understands that it is difficult to break the minds of these poor people over at once, but what should be said, he still has to say a word.
<br><br>It seems to caution them not to put their eyes on useless things, but also seems to tell them that these things are really useless garbage, Yi Feng a few feet stepped on.
