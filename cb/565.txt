Two people came to the Black Sea.
<br><br>The man seemed to remember something and suddenly said, "Your Holiness, I remember not the legend that the Black Sea is full of poisonous things, are you sure the fresh fish there can be eaten?"
<br><br>"Of course!" Jiang Zhi nodded his head.
<br><br>"But the legend is not?"
<br><br>The man worried.
<br><br>"The legend is false."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi said blandly.
<br><br>After all, she had seen it with her own eyes, that human immortal kid fishing with his own body.
<br><br>At that moment, the two saw a beach full of fish bones.
<br><br>There were also traces of burning fire.
<br><br>"Looks like these fish are really edible." When the man saw this, he put his heart down and couldn't help but say, "Did your Holiness eat them?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Jiang Zhi swept the beach and shook his head, "It's not me, it's a human immortal who was locked up here."
<br><br>"Human immortal?" The man smiled, did not put on the heart, confidently said: "Since the district human immortal can eat, it seems that this fish must be very good to get."
<br><br>"I'll go get it." The man volunteered, rolled up his sleeves and was going to find the bait.
<br><br>"No bait, this fish is silly." Jiang Zhi stopped and said, "You just put your hand in, and there will be endless fish to bite you."
<br><br>Hearing Jiang Zhi's words, the man was surprised.
<br><br>"There are such silly fish?"
<br><br>The man said half-heartedly, walking over to the seawater and looking inside.
<br><br>The ink-black seawater makes it completely impossible to see what's inside the clear water. This unknown gives people an inexplicable sense of fear.
<br><br>Squatting down, the man looked inside. Carefully stretched out his hand.
<br><br>But did not dare to put into the sea.
<br><br>Just and the surface of the lake, and suddenly something popped up between!
<br><br>Men at least cultivation is not low, extremely fast reaction to a moment to put back the hand.
<br><br>After the eyes, only after the hindsight to see that it was a fish.
<br><br>An extremely ugly-looking, shiny black scales mixed with the stench, full of sharp teeth fish.
<br><br>"Poof", did not bite something fish fell into the sea.
<br><br>The man was a little scared, "Your Lord is not talking about this kind of fish, right?"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi nodded his head, "Exactly."
<br><br>The man clenched his hands, some hesitation, "This ...... fish how to look a little like the devouring shadow fish ......"
<br><br>The shadow devouring fish is legendary, the dark sea of Shadow Island extremely ferocious and vicious cannibal fish.
<br><br>Although you can not cultivate, but the teeth contain poison, the number of extremely large, once locked prey, extremely fast.
<br><br>Countless shadow-eating fish, once bitten a person, God can not save. And instantly a person can be torn to pieces.
<br><br>Because the body is blue-black, in the dark sea is difficult to detect.
<br><br>With the protection of the Sea of Darkness, immortals with magic power is still difficult to kill it.
<br><br>If the party is really a shadow-devouring fish, then they are a walk in front of the Palace of Hades.
<br><br>The smaller the man, the more fearful.
<br><br>"I just said that the legend is false." Jiang to full of care said, "here is no what devouring shadow fish."
<br><br>"If there really is. That is also blackmail, there is no poison at all." She said, walking to the edge of the sea.
<br><br>The face is unchanged and stretched out his hand, "If you do not dare, then I will come myself."
<br><br>She was about to reach in, but was grabbed by the man.
<br><br>"What does your Holiness mean?" The man grabbed Jiang Zhi's hand, "Can't you think that subordinates really don't dare?"
<br><br>Saying that, he unhesitatingly, put his hand into the water.
<br><br>"Sizzle!!!"
<br><br>The man closed his eyes, clenched his teeth a mouthful of cold air sucked up.
<br><br>This is really nasty pain ......
<br><br>The pain instantly swept the man's limbs, but in order to let Jiang to see his heart, he gritted his teeth and struggled to support.
<br><br>Several breaths passed, the man could not bear it anymore.
<br><br>With a miserable white face, he said, "My hands should be hanging full of fish!" Said, will mention the hand up.
<br><br>Bloody hands, not to mention the fish, even the flesh is no longer.
<br><br>Only white bones remained.
<br><br>The white bones were still smoldering with black gas.
<br><br>Because the seawater is too dark, even blood is not seen.
<br><br>The man was dumbfounded, Jiang to also dumbfounded.
<br><br>The next moment, the man's whole body began to blacken, the eyes burst out.
<br><br>The moment he fell down, he looked at Jiang to incredulously, "You ...... are not deliberately doing a plan ...... to harm me ......"
<br><br>The broken voice stopped, the man also fell down.
<br><br>Became a dead body.
<br><br>Jiang to froze on the beach, round eyes, looking at the man's body in disbelief.
<br><br>The man's body lay on the beach as the waves of the Black Sea rolled over.
<br><br>When the waves receded, only a dry bone remained.
<br><br>The white bones were stained with one or two familiar fish biting wildly.
<br><br>Seeing that the wave was about to hit, Jiang to backed up repeatedly.
<br><br>Why?!
<br><br>She could not figure out ......
<br><br>How suddenly people are gone ......
<br><br>That human immortal did not say that this fish is not poisonous?
<br><br>And he saw with his own eyes that he was fishing with his own flesh!
<br><br>What went wrong?
<br><br>She was filled with anguish and remorse, such a fresh life, buried in front of her eyes in vain.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>At the same time, the immortal world Zhen Yang Hall.
<br><br>A man in seclusion snapped open his eyes.
<br><br>"He died in Shadow Island!" The man was surprised and cautious, "Could he have been discovered by Jiang Zhi?"
<br><br>"No, I need to get out of seclusion now!" The man rose up on the ground and shouted, "Someone!"
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>Yi Feng was lying on a hill, the rest was a soft cushion made of wolf skin.
<br><br>It is as big as one meter eight large bed sheet.
<br><br>Layered on, soft and warm.
<br><br>Next to it is a scoop made of wolf's head, holding a wolf bone hammering his back.
<br><br>"Ding - you have received 100 points of Qi from the Immortal River Continent ......"
<br><br>"Ding - you have received another 200 Qi luck points from the Xianjiang continent ......"
<br><br>"Ding - Enough Qi luck points, system upgrade -"
<br><br>"Ding - system upgrade successful - Qi luck store updated -"
<br><br>"Ding - Qi luck store updated successfully - do you exchange Qi luck points for goods?"
<br><br>At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the back of his mind.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat up abruptly.
<br><br>Good guy, before it was a few points of qi luck points, this time the Immortal River Continent came to 300 qi luck points at once!
<br><br>What a surprise, surprise!
<br><br>Although he couldn't understand where the Qi luck points came from in the Immortal River Continent, Yi Feng happily opened the system.
<br><br>See what features have been upgraded.
<br><br>As a result, a look, not only did not increase any function, but also reduced the talent detection function ......
<br><br>Yi Feng rolled his eyes and got used to this tawdry system.
<br><br>He opened the qi luck store.
<br><br>Looked at it, a glance swept over was attracted by a commodity.
<br><br>Extend cultivation: 30 points - Extend time special effect, one year.
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly thought that the cultivation he had gained now was only one year long, and he had to find the last disciple to make up a full year before he could inherit it. Otherwise, it would be taken back.
<br><br>He looked at this shitty place.
<br><br>Looking for a disciple?
<br><br>What a joke.
<br><br>Disciples can not be found, wolves are a lot of.
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't hesitate to exchange his qi luck points for an extended cultivation.
<br><br>Let's extend it for a year first.
<br><br>After all, I don't know how long I have to stay in this shitty place.
<br><br>After exchanging the extended cultivation, Yi Feng then looked at the divine beast bar.
<br><br>The divine beast ...... swallowed the sky frog.
<br><br>This was a divine beast that he had been longing for.
<br><br>Required Qi luck: 100 points.
<br><br>And with the system upgrade, there seems to be a profile - devouring all things!
<br><br>It's really powerful!
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't wait.
<br><br>He had encountered wolves on this island. Other mutated things have been encountered.
<br><br>Although encountered all eaten.
<br><br>But after all, he is only a human immortal. This is still the place of exile in the immortal world.
<br><br>The equivalent of the immortal world prison.
<br><br>Nine out of ten people who can go to jail are not good things.
<br><br>What if I, a weak human immortal, meet a bad person here?
<br><br>And this Heaven Swallowing Frog is a blessing in the snow.
<br><br>Qi luck value joyfully exchanged for a swallowed sky frog.
<br><br>Once the Qi luck points were used.
<br><br>He then rubbed his palms, his eyes were starry, and he was full of anticipation.
<br><br>Swish!
<br><br>A flash of light.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly looked down.
<br><br>But this look, he was directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>On the ground, is lying a toad, the size of the palm of the hand.
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of questions.
<br><br>Not to say like slowly that big oddball, but at least not so small, right?
<br><br>Also swallow the sky?
<br><br>He put the toad in his hand, look over and over, and the toad in the field can not say like.
<br><br>I can only say that it is exactly the same.
<br><br>No way, the system will not pit him again, right?
<br><br>Yi Feng will believe will put the toad carefully on the side.
<br><br>"You swallow a sky for me to see?"
<br><br>"Quack ......"
<br><br>"Quack!"
<br><br>This cry, hate to let Yi Feng a foot to stomp it to death.
<br><br>He kind of understood that he was once again pitted by this system.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>Also get used to it.
<br><br>"Dog system, I believe you again, I'm not human."
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed, although there were still a lot of Qi luck points, but he was not interested in redeeming anything anymore.
<br><br>However, he was about to close the store when his afterimage glanced at something in the corner.
<br><br>House - twenty points.
<br><br>Tea tree - five points.
<br><br>Rice - five points.
<br><br>...... all kinds of daily necessities and countless more.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng couldn't help but freeze for a moment.
<br><br>"Got."
<br><br>"House is it, I would like to see what house you can exchange for me out."
<br><br>In his heart, Yi Feng was ready to get into trouble with this system and was prepared to be pitched.
<br><br>So, he exchanged all the remaining qi luck points for a house, as well as various tea trees, fruits and vegetables.
