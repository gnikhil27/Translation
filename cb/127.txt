Even though Li Renhao was reluctant, but under the forcefulness of Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu, she had to follow the two in the direction they came from.
<br><br>"This direction, it seems to be the direction he was in before."
<br><br>The body swept over the jungle, Li Renhao's pretty eyebrows twitched, and her soulful eyes scanned the surroundings, expecting to see that familiar figure.
<br><br>But the green and lush woods, can not catch a shadow.
<br><br>Her eyes could not help but become dark.
<br><br>It wasn't that she had any feelings for this mortal, it was because this mortal had repeatedly been safe and sound in the demonic beast-infested mountain range before, which really gave her too much of a shock.
<br><br>"Here we are."
<br><br>"That senior is just ahead."
<br><br>At this time, Li Jiaxin's voice came from ahead excitedly.
<br><br>However, Li Renhao's mind was not on it at all and did not even glance in the direction they were talking about, still looking around in an attempt to find that figure.
<br><br>The three of them landed on the ground and walked in the direction of Yi Feng. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Ren good you have to remember, this senior strength is monstrous, but the state of mind has long reached the realm of return to the realm of truth, and even call themselves mortal, so you and I must not ram him!" Li Jiaxin reminded.
<br><br>While talking, the three have reached Yi Feng not far away.
<br><br>And Yi Feng also saw the three, put down the guitar in his hand, and looked at them with a faint smile.
<br><br>However, Li Renhao was still distracted.
<br><br>Undyingly, he looked around for a while, and only then slightly reluctantly looked in the direction Li Jiaxin said.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>The footsteps fiercely trembled!
<br><br>Red lips also at the same time slightly open and up, a pair of big soulful eyes filled with incredulity.
<br><br>This face.
<br><br>This face.
<br><br>This familiar figure ......
<br><br>"Aunt, aunt, this is the senior you said?"
<br><br>Li Renhao was frozen for a long time before he reacted and asked incredulously.
<br><br>"What are you talking about Renhao, you must not be rude." Li Jiaxin nervously scolded, "Hurry up and meet the gentleman."
<br><br>But Li Renhao seemed as if she had not heard Li Jiaxin's words, still in the midst of the unbelievable event in front of her, not having slowed down.
<br><br>She never thought that the super expert Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu were talking about was the mortal she had encountered in the mountain range.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>He clearly did not have any cultivation, so how could he be a super expert?
<br><br>For a moment, Li Renhao felt dumbfounded!
<br><br>And when Li Jiaxin saw that Li Renhao was not right, she frowned and came closer and asked, "Renhao, what is wrong with you?"
<br><br>"Auntie, did you guys make a mistake?"
<br><br>Finally, Li Renhao clenched her red lips and said with a complicated face, "Is he really the senior you guys are talking about?"
<br><br>"What do you mean by that?" On the side, Xu Mozhu came and asked with a frown.
<br><br>"He is the mortal I told you about!" Li Renhao frowned her pretty eyebrows and explained, "And now it has become an expert in your mouths, are you really not mistaken?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu were instantly frozen in place.
<br><br>It also never occurred to them that the senior they were talking about was actually the mortal that Li Renhao had said in his mouth.
<br><br>This is also, too much of a coincidence!
<br><br>But they instantly reacted, it must be Li Renhao, this dead girl's lack of eyesight, she didn't see this person's terror at all before.
<br><br>"Aiya, you dead girl, why are you so muddleheaded." Li Jiaxin hurriedly lectured, "It's not that your master and I misjudged the person, but your strength is too low to see the depth of this person."
<br><br>Li Renhao frowned.
<br><br>There was still some unbelief in what was in front of him, and it felt a little too outrageous.
<br><br>He and Yi Feng deal with not once or twice, how to look at just a mortal but, how suddenly become an expert?
<br><br>"You child, if you do not believe, you see what is on that tree trunk?" Li Jiaxin made a wink and said in a hurry.
<br><br>Li Renhao slightly lifted his chin and looked toward that tree trunk.
<br><br>"A kingpin, what's wrong with it?"
<br><br>Li Renhao wasn't surprised, because this was not the first time she had seen this Wangba, and it had been carried in Yi Feng's hand before.
<br><br>"You silly girl, how can you be so unintelligent this time, you mobilize your Yuan Qi again to take a good look, what is that Wang Ba?" Xu Mozhu shouted with hatred from the side.
<br><br>Li Renhao frowned.
<br><br>Rather reluctantly mobilize the body Yuan Qi, lingering around the eyes, unimpressed towards that Wang Baba look.
<br><br>It seems ......
<br><br>There really is something unusual?
<br><br>Can't help but, she put away the casual, fixed eyes looked over.
<br><br>This look.
<br><br>Finally saw the Wang Biao's mystery, which immediately made her whole person stunned in place, the mind like a lightning strike!
