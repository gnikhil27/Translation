 "What?"
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>The black bear froze, obviously not responding.
<br><br>"You silly bear, you were quite shrewd just now, why can't you turn around now?" <br><br>"I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
<br><br>"Yes, why don't you pay your respects to big brother?"
<br><br>The centipede also yelled from the side.
<br><br>"Really ...... really?"
<br><br>The black bear cried out with joy.
<br><br>Full of disbelief.
<br><br>He just said what he said to save his life, but he never thought that there would be such an unexpected joy.
<br><br>If he could follow these guys, he wouldn't need to be afraid on the island at all. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because for other demon beasts, he has a unique natural skill.
<br><br>That is, he is very sensitive to danger and powerful things.
<br><br>So whether it was Wu Chang'an at the beginning, or Yi Feng later, or now Bone Ben Wei, he was able to keenly perceive, despite not knowing their exact strength, the threat that the other side brought to him.
<br><br>The threat brought to him by the skeleton Ben Wei in front of him is huge, which also precisely means that the skeleton Ben Wei has super strength.
<br><br>"Greetings to big brother."
<br><br>After the black bear reacted, without saying a word, he knelt on the ground, arched his buttocks and shouted, "Big brother is blessed with a thousand generations."
<br><br>"Nice, very cute little bear."
<br><br>Bones Benway beckoned and said appreciatively, "From now on, you have nothing in the world to fear except a man who loves money, and a snail that lies still."
<br><br>"A man who loves money, and a snail that lies still?"
<br><br>Black Bear nodded and took it to heart.
<br><br>"Ahem."
<br><br>Just then, a coughing sound came from the dog and the centipede on the side at the same time.
<br><br>Seeing this, Black Bear was busy reacting and turned around and shouted, "Greetings to the Second Brother and Greetings to the Third Brother."
<br><br>"Very good, very good."
<br><br>"In the future, if you follow us, you will have a good meal and no one will dare to bully you in this life."
<br><br>The dog and the centipede raised their heads at once, and were also full of appreciation.
<br><br>Just then, the mark on the dog's forehead lit up.
<br><br>He raised his head and looked his gaze into the distance.
<br><br>"Qing ah, what's wrong?"
<br><br>Bones asked.
<br><br>"Brother, it seems that someone from my tribe is looking for me not far away." The dog said.
<br><br>"Oh, go on then go on."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei waved his hand, and when the dog had gone, Bone Ben Wei laid down leisurely.
<br><br>"Bear ah, do you have any fun project ah, introduce to brother?" Bone Ben Wei said leisurely.
<br><br>"Brother, I was sealed on this island in the early years, and I can't leave this island at all, so I really don't know what's interesting ah." The black bear came over and helped Skeleton Ben Wei hammer his legs and said with his head down.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"What kind of person dares to seal you on the island?" Bone Ben Wei asked at once.
<br><br>"It was 100,000 years ago, and 30,000 years ago my descendants came to inform me that the group of people who sealed me up in the first place had all died of old age." The black bear grinned openly and laughed nervously.
<br><br>Hearing this, Bone Ben Wei was also shocked.
<br><br>To know, in the Immortal River Continent even if a Martial Emperor cultivates, the life span is only tens of thousands of years, and even if the life span of demon beasts is longer, it will always be limited.
<br><br>But this guy, the black bear, has been sealed on this island alone for as long as 100,000 years, which is completely unreasonable.
<br><br>"How come you haven't died after such a long time?" Bone Ben Wei couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"I don't know about this, anyway, by now I've lived for more than 10,000 years, and my longevity has not reached, so I can't die even if I fight." The black bear scratched his head and laughed heatedly, "When my enemy saw that he couldn't kill me, he sealed me up."
<br><br>After finishing, he hastily added, "Of course, the exception is you, big brother, I feel that if big brother let me die, he should be able to get me to die."
<br><br>"You do have some self-awareness." Bone Ben Wei couldn't help but raise his chin in appreciation.
<br><br>"That's that."
<br><br>Black Bear laughed heatedly and said, "However, besides big brother, I met two other people the other day, one of them is a threat to me, I'm not sure if I can get me killed, the other one is horrible, he is completely capable of getting me killed."
<br><br>"The one you're talking about, that would be my master." Skeleton Benevolent said, "It's that money-loving guy I was talking about, anyway, just don't mess with him, even the sky can't save you if you mess with him."
<br><br>"So that man is the master of Big Brother, no wonder no wonder."
<br><br>The black bear took a breath backwards at once.
<br><br>But the more it did, the more he felt grounded.
<br><br>That is to say, both of the people who were able to pose a threat to his life were his own people.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, something big has happened."
<br><br>Just then, the dog who had gone out had returned, his hurried appearance full of panic.
<br><br>"What's the matter so panic ah Qing?" Skeleton Ben Wei asked as he lay on the ground, glancing at his eyes.
<br><br>"I have a son brother."
<br><br>Ao Qing shouted.
<br><br>"What the hell?"
<br><br>On hearing this, Bone Ben Wei jumped up violently
