After they had gone.
<br><br>Exterminate the mind to let go, feel the surrounding movement at the same time, sit down.
<br><br>Face.
<br><br>A small smile hung up.
<br><br>Although all the Qi of the Immortal River Continent was lost, but the Lord did not blame him.
<br><br>After all, the messenger lord who came down to reinforce him last time was beaten by that mysterious black-robed man with a single punch and flew into smoke, so it was reasonable that he couldn't compete.
<br><br>And not only did not blame, the Lord sent a new messenger also said, as long as he cooperated with the Sky Kui ten people to find out who the culprit is, will also reward him with supreme opportunities.
<br><br>This Heavenly Kui ten people although out of the division, directly lost one person, but look at this illusion of the law is still very strong.
<br><br>I think it will be able to return soon!
<br><br>After exploring the bottom of the island, I'm afraid it's not far from the completion of the mission.
<br><br>This means that he is not far from the Lord's supreme reward. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>I don't know.
<br><br>It's great!
<br><br>I just need to sit here and wait.
<br><br>Perdition smiled with his eyebrows.
<br><br>"The smell of dung!"
<br><br>Nine flying insects streaked by like shooting stars, and one of them sent an urgent message towards the others.
<br><br>"Don't make any rash moves."
<br><br>"This person easily defeated the three of you, must be a super high expert on this island, and there are definitely not many people like this on this island, so for the time being, go around him."
<br><br>The leader man sent a voice towards the crowd and issued an order, "It's not too late to turn back and deal with him after we get the information in hand!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads and shifted their direction to bypass Rudaseng.
<br><br>After bypassing Rudaseng, the nine flying insects were suspended in mid-air.
<br><br>"Remember my orders, split up and gather information."
<br><br>"Then rendezvous at the southern shore of the island, and finally retreat together."
<br><br>"Disperse!"
<br><br>As the leader man transmitted his voice, the eight flying insects immediately scattered out, in groups of two, and boarded the island from all sides.
<br><br>"Lao Jiu, I feel that we are invincible in this defense!"
<br><br>Old eight and old nine flew through the water against the surface, while chatting.
<br><br>"En, now this state, even if the boss full force on us a blow, can not do us half harm!"
<br><br>"Alas, if only it had been in this state when facing that stretcher of dung, Old Ten wouldn't have died."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"When we find out the information, then we can take revenge for Old Ten!"
<br><br>The two chatted as they flew by.
<br><br>"Huh!"
<br><br>Just then, Old Nine gave a light eek and said in surprise, "Old Eight, look, there's a fish inside the water at our feet!"
<br><br>Old eight glanced at it, indifferent said: "A small fish, it can still become a spirit, do not care about it, boarding the island is important."
<br><br>But his words just fell.
<br><br>Then I saw the carp bounced out of the water and swallowed Lao Jiu with one bite.
<br><br>"Crap?"
<br><br>"Lao Jiu?"
<br><br>The old eight shouted with a glare.
<br><br>The next moment, the water surface revealed a pair of fish bubble eyes, staring at him.
<br><br>This eye, immediately let the old eight creepy.
<br><br>The carp instantly popped up and swallowed him with one bite.
<br><br>To death.
<br><br>He also did not understand how he was swallowed by an ordinary small carp.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"I thought this island had some kind of mechanism, that's all!"
<br><br>"It's not a smooth and smooth boarding of the island."
<br><br>On the other hand, the old six old seven has successfully boarded the island, suspended on the shore next to the tree, observing the surrounding.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>The two of them always felt that something was staring at them.
<br><br>Turning back to look.
<br><br>At once, they found a small chameleon, lying on a tree turning its small round eyes to stare at them.
<br><br>"Heh!"
<br><br>"This little thing still wants to eat us?"
<br><br>Old Six saw this, snickered: "Little thing, we are not your food, want to eat us, but also depends on whether you can digest it."
<br><br>The voice just fell.
<br><br>A tongue rolled directly to.
<br><br>The two brothers were still laughing, the tongue directly bound them both to death, and then a back, directly swallowed into the chameleon mouth.
<br><br>Chameleon turned three hundred and sixty degrees round eyes, like and in the rolled eyes, and then lying on the tree to sleep.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Ga!"
<br><br>"Old five!"
<br><br>On the other hand, just on the island of the old four old five encountered a cool under the tree of the big mother, the big mother a mosquito swatter fan over, directly the old five pumped over on the ground.
<br><br>Not yet slowed down, the aunt a foot stepped over.
<br><br>And crushed.
<br><br>"There are so many mosquitoes under this tree, do not take the cool not take the cool."
<br><br>Unhappy spit a sentence, the big mother only twisted the bucket waist cursing away.
<br><br>Looking at the old five who were crushed into slag, shit are overflowing, the old four stare at the eyes.
<br><br>Feels like his scalp is going to explode.
<br><br>This fucking.
<br><br>In the end, what the hell is going on ah?
<br><br>I thought we agreed to invincible defense.
<br><br>How could it be crushed into a cake by a big mother!
<br><br>He was just about to seek revenge on the mother, when he suddenly found a rooster next to him, with its crown and red eyes, clucking towards him.
<br><br>The chicken's head fell.
<br><br>Lao Si stared at him with wide eyes.
<br><br>The pain came and found that half of his body was gone.
<br><br>Looked up, it was pecked off half by the rooster.
<br><br>The rooster tasted delicious, clucking, and then a low head, the other half of the old four also no.
<br><br>......
<br><br>And as for the worst than the old two old three.
<br><br>Is moving a stool lying to the river bank, ready to enjoy the hump of the landscape painting of Zhong Qing, just lit a circle of Yi Feng previously invented mosquito incense, the two rushed over.
<br><br>Just a little bit of smoke.
<br><br>Two bugs on a life.
<br><br>......
<br><br>At this time the head of the man also boarded the island.
<br><br>After boarding the island, he found a shady spot, hunkered down.
<br><br>"This island, really is not simple."
<br><br>Thinking about just now, he still had palpitations.
<br><br>Because he was discovered by someone else.
<br><br>This person is a few years old little kid, still wearing crotch pants, but a glance on him, beckoning hands directly to catch him.
<br><br>The mouth is still silly shouting: "Catch the little flying insect, catch the little flying insect."
<br><br>The two men tangled for a long time.
<br><br>The man exerted his fastest speed and struggled to escape from the kid's hands.
<br><br>"A child?"
<br><br>"Hmph, the hell believe you are a child."
<br><br>"With the power of space in your hand, I'm afraid it's not much worse than that dung bearer."
<br><br>"If I'm fooled by your appearance, then I'm a fool, and inside I guess I'm an old monster who has lived for many years!"
<br><br>"If I wasn't wise and resourceful, I'm afraid I would have been fooled by your appearance and fallen into your path."
<br><br>"If the manure bearer is the first level of the island, then this child, should be the second level!"
<br><br>The man sneered.
<br><br>"Although I was targeted by this child, but undoubtedly attracted the fire."
<br><br>"I'm sure that the second and third brothers and the other brothers have also successfully boarded the island!"
<br><br>"Good, I don't necessarily have to go scouting personally, I just need to attract this kid's attention, so that he can't spare his hands to deal with the others, so that they have enough time to scout for information, is also a good choice."
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>The man tuned up.
<br><br>Over the next few days, the man would always appear in front of the kid from time to time, attracting him to strike at himself, thus buying time for the other brothers.
<br><br>A full three days.
<br><br>Only then did the man let out a sigh of relief and a smile appeared on his face.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>"This expert on the island who disguised himself as a child, his attention was really attracted by me."
<br><br>"But the path is high, the devil is high, ah, you were eventually tricked by me, if what is expected is good, the others have successfully pried out the information and are waiting for me at the south shore."
<br><br>"In that case, then I will go to find them to rendezvous!"
