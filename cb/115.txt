"Damn, although there is no demonic beast as the woman said, but there are really a lot of beasts out recently!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's cursing voice came out.
<br><br>This two days down, there are countless snakes ah, wild boars ah, crows ah and other animals like in heat, desperately come to harass him, making him annoyed.
<br><br>It can be said that recently he has not slept a good sleep.
<br><br>Looked at the sky, know that today is not able to rush, so Yi Feng had to be ready to sleep on the ground.
<br><br>But those animals in heat always have to think of a way.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng took out a small bamboo basket inside a small medicine bottle, and then dumped the powder in the bottle around the camp, this is Yi Feng came before the deliberate deployment of the powder, with Xiong Huang such use is similar.
<br><br>This powder may not be able to prevent wild boars such large beasts, but think to prevent some insects and ants or no problem.
<br><br>After doing this, Yi Feng yawned, bracing his tired body, leaning on the rocks and whistling.
<br><br>On top of a hill.
<br><br>Led by the Eagle King and Snake King, countless demonic beasts descended on this place. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Gentlemen, make sure to find this person, and whether he is the one we are looking for or not, kill without amnesty!" The Eagle King flashed his gloomy eyes and ordered towards the other demonic beasts around.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>With his order, countless demonic beasts spread out in all directions.
<br><br>"Let's just wait here for news!" The Eagle King said.
<br><br>"Hm!"
<br><br>The Snake King nodded and was just about to close his eyes to calm his mind when he suddenly spotted something and said in surprise, "Is that the Night Wind Centipede?"
<br><br>Hearing that, the Eagle King also forgot his gaze over, and his eyebrows immediately frowned.
<br><br>"Isn't the Night Wind Centipede recuperating in the cave, why did he come here?"
<br><br>Saying that, the Eagle King swept out, and his sharp claws directly grabbed the Night Wind Centipede.
<br><br>"Ah, Eagle Hawk King, why are you here?"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede stared at him with eyes full of panic and asked, as a servant of the Bo Gu Demon Emperor, he knew that the Bo Gu Demon Emperor had once hidden an aura pearl with great tonic effects here, he had wanted to run away with the aura pearl, but he didn't expect to be caught by the Eagle King just after he got his hands on it.
<br><br>"I was going to ask, how come you are here?" The Eagle King's sharp eyes stared at him and asked, "Aren't you recuperating from your injuries inside the cave?"
<br><br>"I, I, I, I, I ......," the night wind centipede with a swift move to hide the aura beads behind him, turning small eyes panic: "The demon emperor was captured, how can I have the heart to stay in the cave to recuperate ah, I did not rush out to see I just rushed out to see if there is any trace of that human."
<br><br>At these words, the Eagle King's face was slightly relieved.
<br><br>And asked: "That night wind demon spirit you have found anything."
<br><br>"Found?"
<br><br>"Discovery? ......"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede heart anxious, stammering for half a day, which only smothered said: "found is certainly found, and I think that the human is likely to be nearby ah!"
<br><br>After saying that, the night wind centipede vainly lowered his head, not daring to the gaze of the Eagle King.
<br><br>But what he did not expect was that the Eagle King nodded gratefully and appreciated: "Night Wind Centipede you really have a heart, worthy of following the existence of six demon emperors, you are right, according to reliable information, there is indeed a human in the vicinity, as to whether it is that person has yet to be determined."
<br><br>"So Night Wind Demon Spirit, come with me and the Snake King to find out what's going on?"
<br><br>"Uh uh ...... ah?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede nodded his head and stared in reaction.
<br><br>"What, the Night Wind Demon Spirit refuses to contribute to Lord Demon Emperor?" The Eagle King asked with a frown.
<br><br>"No, no, no, how, I hate to give my life for the Demon Emperor." The Night Wind Centipede said righteously, but at the same time the small eyes were turning quickly, attempting to be looking for an opportunity to escape.
<br><br>Not long after, a small demon came to report that they found Yi Feng's trail.
<br><br>"Let's go Snake King, Night Wind Spirit King!" The Eagle King said.
<br><br>"Good good."
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede wiped his sweat, in the eyes of the two major demon kings disciples, he only had to follow.
<br><br>Approaching his destination, the Eagle King frowned.
<br><br>"Sure enough, there is a human breath, but there is not much fluctuation, pass my order, first this person completely surrounded, wait for my order then together to strike to capture him!"
<br><br>Eagle King immediately passed out orders, apparently did not want to appear like the Imperial Sword Sect, so that the Martial King human has not been captured until now.
<br><br>Perhaps, it would have been possible to get a clue to the Demon Emperor's whereabouts from these humans long ago.
<br><br>The demons immediately surrounded Yi Feng, a pair of cold eyes staring at him.
<br><br>But Yi Feng was unaware of all this and was still sleeping on the stone.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>With a command from the Eagle King, dozens of demonic beasts around turned into streams of light and enveloped towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Then they reached Yi Feng's surroundings.
<br><br>However, in the next moment, those demonic beasts suddenly took a step, their bodies suddenly went soft, and their eyes couldn't help but start to blacken.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The crowd of demons revealed a panicked look, and those who were not cautious in strength even directly returned to their original bodies and died suddenly on the ground, leaving only a part of the demon spirits still struggling to hold on, but it was also difficult to move an inch.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The Eagle King was immediately alert.
<br><br>"Report to the demon king, poison, this human has poisoned the surrounding." One of the demon spirits said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"Poison?"
<br><br>The Eagle King swept his gaze, and indeed there was a circle of medicinal powder on the ground, but this did not make him step back, because in his opinion, since the martial spirits under him could still hold on, it meant that the poison was also limited in its medicinal properties.
<br><br>"Snake King, it seems we have to do it ourselves." The Eagle King said as he looked to the Snake King.
<br><br>The Snake King nodded, while his gaze also looked at the Night Wind Centipede, said: "Night Wind Demon Spirit, you follow several demon emperors, I think the strength is also not ordinary demon spirit comparable, together to fight!"
<br><br>Said, the eagle king and snake king for insurance purposes, into the strongest demon beast body, speed swept out.
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede reluctantly nodded, but remembered that it was a human with little fluctuation anyway, thought there must be no danger, so also transformed into the body to follow!
<br><br>Just when a few of them were ready to make a move, Yi Feng, who was lying on the rock, rolled over and revealed a side face.
<br><br>And just in time, this side face by the night wind centipede into the eyes.
