The moment these words fell.
<br><br>Old man Wang, pork Rong, Wu Yong Hong Lu Dasheng and others stood up almost at the same time, with a forcing chill flashing in their eyes.
<br><br>Although Mr. low-profile, for such taunts he may not take to heart, but not necessarily they can endure.
<br><br>If not for the fear of Mr. angry and not dare to act rashly, this small family in front of them would have been razed to the ground in an instant.
<br><br>"It's not necessary."
<br><br>Yi Feng also stood up and gave a reminder towards Wu Yonghong and the others, then turned his gaze towards Li Yuan and said, "Li family head, I think you really think too much, since that's the case, then we won't stay."
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed the crowd to pack up their things and directly leave.
<br><br>Because this obviously look down on up people, your family is big how, do I still lick you?
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"I really hope you will not regret ah!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>And old man Wang and others stared at Li Yuan before leaving with an angry grunt, also left with him.
<br><br>"Regret?"
<br><br>"A group of mortals pretending to be quite like that."
<br><br>Looking at the figure of Yi Feng and others leaving, Li Yuan sat at the head of the seat and shook his head, a few mortals left, he will regret?
<br><br>What a joke.
<br><br>This kind of opportunity to climb his Li family he has seen a lot of people, his daughter Li Yihan simple-minded can not see it is just, he tang Li family head and how will not see.
<br><br>But his daughter has been away for a long time, so long not to see her, take advantage of her back, father and daughter have to reunite ah!
<br><br>Thinking, he got up and walked towards Li Yihan's boudoir.
<br><br>"Daughter, how is it?"
<br><br>Outside the door of the room, Li Yuan knocked on the door and asked with a smile.
<br><br>Li Yihan, who was adjusting her cultivation a little, heard Li Yuan's voice, her pretty eyebrows immediately frowned and hurriedly asked, "Father, I'm fine, but why did you come here, you were not receiving Mr. and the others, where are they?"
<br><br>"Aiya, I just want to keep you company more."
<br><br>Li Yuan laughed and said evasively, then pushed the door in.
<br><br>But Li Yihan's face changed, and she hurriedly got up and said reproachfully, "Father, sir, they are still in the hall, why did you leave them there and come to me by yourself."
<br><br>Saying that, she ran towards the living room in spite of Li Yuan's persuasion.
<br><br>But when she got to the living room, it was empty.
<br><br>"Father, what's going on here, where are they, sir?" Li Yihan looked at Li Yuan who followed her up and asked with an anxious expression.
<br><br>"Aiya daughter you take it easy don't be anxious."
<br><br>Li Yuan comforted, slowly and methodically sat Li Yihan down, then softly taught: "Daughter, ah, although you have good talent, but the mind is ultimately too light out a little ah, those people are only mortals, and you are not the same way at all."
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Li Yihan heard Li Yuan's words, almost swish stood up, deadly stared at Li Yuan asked, "Father, you quickly tell me, they people in the end where to go."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Li Yihan, who had always been unconvincing, was so anxious at this moment that she was about to cry.
<br><br>"Daughter, ah, I said they are just some mortals, mortals, well, to be able to let them come in our Li family to sit for a while is fine."
<br><br>Li Yuan said in a serious voice: "A few mortals, we really do not treat them as guests, not to mention that people's hearts are unpredictable, no one can predict that they approach you, is not to climb on my Li family, so sit down, let them have a cup of tea and then also sent away."
<br><br>"Sent away?"
<br><br>These words fell in Li Yihan's mind, like a thunderbolt.
<br><br>The face swish turned miserable white, the palms of the feet also powerless back a few steps, paralyzed on the stool, the mind echoed Li Yuan's words, for a long time.
<br><br>"Daughter, daughter what's wrong with you?" Li Yuan hurriedly asked worriedly, "You can't, you can't really be looking at that mortal, right?"
<br><br>"Don't touch me."
<br><br>But Li Yihan fiercely shook off Li Yuan's palm, and his red eyes stared deadly at Li Yuan and said through gritted teeth, "A mouthful of mortals, you can say that?"
<br><br>"And I look up to him, you do not see whether our Li family has this qualification?"
<br><br>"I don't know why you are so confused after being the head of the family for so many years, just now I instructed you a thousand times to always receive them well, but you just didn't listen and sent them away ......"
<br><br>"Oh, you actually sent them away ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Li Yihan, whose face was white with rage, spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood.
<br><br>"Ah, daughter you."
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Yuan hurriedly went forward, but was pushed away by Li Yihan once again.
<br><br>"Daughter, this is too much for you, right?" Seeing this, Li Yuan said with the same unattractive face, "It's just a few mortals, just go away, but I am your father!"
<br><br>"Shut up!"
<br><br>Li Yihan hissed: "Now you still bite a mortal, completely do not take it seriously, completely do not understand the seriousness of the matter, since I have instructed you to receive solemnly, do you not see that they are just mortals, they are really as simple as they appear?"
<br><br>"What do you mean by that?" Li Yuan asked with a sunken face.
<br><br>"Heh."
<br><br>Li Yihan said with red eyes and shook his head, "You should know about the incident at the Nansha border two days ago, right?"
<br><br>"The matter has spread all over Nansha, so I naturally know, but what does that matter of Nansha border have to do with them?" Li Yuan asked in confusion.
<br><br>"Fine, fine, then I'll tell you what they have to do with the Nansha border."
<br><br>Li Yihan wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and stared at Li Yuan as he delivered his voice word by word, "Because they, the ones involved!"
<br><br>"And that gentleman, is the one who made all the forces in Nansha gather at the Nansha border to receive - the supreme master!"
