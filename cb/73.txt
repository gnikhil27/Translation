Two women, a rare stand to the same line.

<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>"Qingshan you old pickpocket, I don't care what conspiracy you used to capture that one's trust, but after tonight, my Xuanwu Sect is not afraid anymore."
<br><br>In the Xuanwu Sect's main hall, Ning Xuanwu looked at the jade slip in his hand, and a joyful laughter came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"Patriarch, what is so exciting?"
<br><br>At the bottom, the elders asked.
<br><br>"Ling'er was fortunate enough to take the one at the bottom of the mountain, and has taken the one at the bottom of the mountain!" Ning Xuanwu clenched his fist and said with a joyful face, "After tonight, Ling'er is that one's woman, with this status, with Ling'er's means, the previous friction can soon be resolved and bring unexpected benefits to my Xuanwu Sect."

<br><br>For a while, the people of the Xuanwu Sect also gushed with joy, revealing their excitement.
<br><br>The rise of the Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>It was just around the corner.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>While in the meeting hall of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, Mao Lin, who originally had a gloomy face, slapped his thighs and stood up violently after receiving the message from his men.
<br><br>"President, what's making you so excited?"
<br><br>"That's right, what's really exciting, it's better to take care of the Chamber's business first!"
<br><br>"Good, now that book is bringing more and more influence to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, if you can't think of a way, we'll have to discuss it and replace you as the president."
<br><br>The Chamber of Commerce's many senior executives had emitted gloomy voices, with their interests as the main focus, they were now dissatisfied with Mao Lin and his.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Replace me, I see which one of you dares to replace me, is it just a little Yi Feng, what's worth such gloom?"
<br><br>At the top, Mao Lin waved the note in his hand with great vigor and said solemnly, "The matter has come to this, I will not hide it from you, my daughter and that Yi Feng will soon be engaged in private life, and in the future he will have to respectfully call me father-in-law when he sees me."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Is this true?"
<br><br>At these words, the Chamber of Commerce senior management have revealed shocked eyes.
<br><br>"Humph, I would lie about my daughter's lifelong importance?" Mao Lin snorted angrily, his eyes filled with smugness.
<br><br>"So that's how it is, that's great."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, Chairman, we misspoke just now, since he has become your son-in-law, it will no longer be a matter of words for him to serve my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce later."
<br><br>"That's right, President, you are still calm enough, such a good thing did not tell us earlier, so we worry for so long for nothing."
<br><br>Listening to the flattery of this group of people, Mao Lin stood with his hands in the air, subconsciously tilted his chin, full of acceptance.
<br><br>After the dinner, Yi Feng brought the two women directly to the heavenly room of the restaurant.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Bullock."
<br><br>Outside, Wang Xuan, who had been paying attention to Yi Feng, sucked in a breath of cold air, his eyes filled with envy.
<br><br>After entering the room, the two women's faces were welling up with a playful red color, thinking that soon the three of them would all be landlords, becoming a little apprehensive, but with some expectation.
<br><br>"Come on!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on the table and said with a smile.
<br><br>"Sir, just, just on the table?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er asked with her red lips slightly open, and while asking the question, she glanced at Demon Ling'er, whose face was also filled with a shy look.
<br><br>Surprisingly right on the table ......
<br><br>But since Yi Feng so commanded, they naturally did not dare to have any opinion, have leaned towards Yi Feng table, the face of the scarlet is more and more blooming, even the neck also became a little hot.
<br><br>After all, no matter whether it is Demon Ling'er or Mao Yun'er, landlord is still the first time ah, let alone three people at the table to fight landlord.
<br><br>This is shy to think about ah!
<br><br>"Let's start!"
<br><br>Finally, Yi Feng took the playing cards out of his arms and slapped them on the table.
