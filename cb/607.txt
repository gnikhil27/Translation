And at the same time.
<br><br>Sun Moon Sect martial arts arena.
<br><br>At this moment, a huge commotion was ushered in.
<br><br>Because following the death of eight Golden Immortals and one Earth Immortal at the opening of Sun Moon Peak, the time after that was the death of more than twenty people one after another.
<br><br>And these twenty-odd people did not teleport out through the jade slip.
<br><br>Their result is obvious.
<br><br>All of them died inside.
<br><br>This caused the whole martial arts arena to talk a lot.
<br><br>And Bai Jing's face was even gloomy to the extreme.
<br><br>The competition had just started, but if we add the nine people who died before and the ones who died after, he had lost thirty people from Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>A full thirty people ah. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>If these thirty people were all Earth Immortals, it would be fine.
<br><br>There are so many Golden Immortals and Heavenly Immortals inside.
<br><br>This kind of strength is the absolute mainstay of his Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>Even in previous years, the entire competition has not been carried out, there has not been this kind of loss.
<br><br>"What's going on here, what the hell is going on here?" Hundred Jing thought through his head but could not understand what was going on inside.
<br><br>He really couldn't sit down anymore.
<br><br>He instructed the disciples under him, "You guys keep an eye on it here, I'll go back and report the situation to the clan master."
<br><br>After giving the order, he couldn't wait to rush back towards the Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>Outside the secret room of Sun and Moon Peak, Bai Jing stood respectfully.
<br><br>"Disciple Bai Jing, pay my respects to the master."
<br><br>There was silence inside.
<br><br>Bai Jing frowned and hesitated for a moment before shouting again, "Disciple Bai Jing, pay respects to Master, there is something important to report."
<br><br>However, his voice just fell.
<br><br>The stone door in front of him exploded and a palm print came towards him.
<br><br>Accompanying this palm print was a series of furious curses.
<br><br>"I worship your grandma's wire ball, you stinky shabby, who told you to shout outside the door."
<br><br>Guo Shijie rushed out with his head cloaked and his face full of anger.
<br><br>Bai Jing was slapped by this slap more than ten feet, see Guo Shijie angry appearance, regardless of the injury quickly kneeled on the ground trembling and shouted: "Master, master calm down, I am if there is to report."
<br><br>"Something has happened to the competition."
<br><br>"Since the beginning of the competition, we lost eight Golden Immortals and one Earth Immortal, and afterwards, we lost more than twenty people, all of them are the backbone of my Sun Moon Peak, this matter is very important, so I have to report it to you!
<br><br>"A matter of great importance?"
<br><br>"My big nasty egg!"
<br><br>What came was a hard kick from Guo Shijie who was furious.
<br><br>He was simply about to die of anger.
<br><br>Due to that matter in the outer secret realm, he had been slapped by the patriarch, touching his meridians and even his life.
<br><br>If he didn't take care of himself, his realm would slip, or he would lose his life.
<br><br>So he didn't even care about the big competition, he just ran back to close up.
<br><br>After the retreat, he used countless heavenly treasures and thought of various ways to suppress the injury.
<br><br>But damn, the last moment.
<br><br>The last minute ah!
<br><br>This damned Bai Jing was shouting outside.
<br><br>This made him give up all his previous work and go back to his liberation in one go.
<br><br>Thinking about all those heavenly treasures he had lost, it was like his heart and liver were trembling.
<br><br>"Waste, waste, you waste thing, I let you matter, I let you matter ......"
<br><br>A body of anger, all vented on the body of the hundred Jing, a foot tucked, "do not see the old man in seclusion, seclusion before I said how, anything is not allowed to disturb me, you are good, dead thirty disciples ran to the door to force chatter."
<br><br>"Is not the injury of this peak master more important than thirty dead people, this you also come to disturb me?"
<br><br>"Ooooooooooo ......"
<br><br>"Master, I was wrong, master I won't dare again."
<br><br>That carried the immortal Yuan's palm kicked, kicked Bai Jing is the nose and face, kneeling on the ground repeatedly begged for mercy up.
<br><br>After a long, long time, Guo Shijie then gave up.
<br><br>"I'll warn you one last time."
<br><br>"Do not come to bother me again, remember it's anything, anything, even if it's something like the sky is falling, do you hear me?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie drank heavily, his voice not lacking in threatening intent.
<br><br>This made Bai Jing tremble.
<br><br>He profoundly understood that if such a thing happened again, Guo Shijie might even take his life, so he hurriedly kowtowed.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, disciple understands and promises that anything will not bother Master again."
<br><br>After kowtowing, Bai Jing clutched his nose-swollen face and fled as if for his life.
