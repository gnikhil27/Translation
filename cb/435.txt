"Where have you seen it before?"
<br><br>The four people asked in unison.
<br><br>"Right in the Hall of Return!"
<br><br>The person in charge said in surprise, "What's wrong four patriarchs, what's the problem?"
<br><br>"Just in the Hall of Return?"
<br><br>The four people instantly closed in, and Li Canghai even grabbed his lapel and asked in an urgent tone, "When did he come to my Gui Xiang Hall?"
<br><br>"Just, just a few days ago, didn't a rogue mortal come to our Gui Xiang Hall and insist on joining our Gui Xiang Hall?" The person in charge said in a hurry.
<br><br>"You mean that the mortal who came to the Returned Hall that day was him?"
<br><br>The four people stared and asked.
<br><br>"Yes, it's him, I won't be mistaken."
<br><br>The person in charge nodded his head and said, "The four patriarchs were also present at that time, I even asked for your advice, you said to blast him out, so I did as you instructed and blasted him out." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The four people were dumbfounded.
<br><br>Sense.
<br><br>This senior had not only given them a chance, huh?
<br><br>Jian Hengtian sat down on his butt.
<br><br>At first, he had threatened to slap this mortal to death.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>The other three were attacked by anxious fire and spurted out a mouthful of old blood.
<br><br>Then they hung their feet and stretched their chests and slapped heavily on the spot again.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>The person in charge next to him was stunned and asked with an urgent face, "Four Patriarchs, what is wrong with you, why do you have to sin yourselves like this!"
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>What was ushered in was the sound of the collective anger of the four patriarchs.
<br><br>That person in charge knelt on the ground in fear, trembling and shaking, holding his head to spare his life.
<br><br>After the four people had calmed down, that person in charge realized the cause and effect of the matter, and also immediately scared his neck cold.
<br><br>At that time.
<br><br>But he personally blew this one out ah!
<br><br>With the portrait in hand, he instantly pissed his ass back to the Hall of Return and informed the matter down.
<br><br>"I still have some business, so I'll go back to the Heavenly Dragon Valley first."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong said with a grim face and swept away.
<br><br>"I'll go first as well."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian similarly swept out of the air.
<br><br>And Liu Gu Yi and Li Canghai also followed closely behind, each returning to their own clans.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>After the four left, they all unspokenly took out their teleportation jade slips and sent a message towards their respective clans.
<br><br>"Immediately prepare for me a number of Imperial, Zong, Saint, and Emperor grade pills and send them to the Green Ox Sect."
<br><br>"Send a batch of my clan's flying swords, spiritual treasures, and treasures of all major grades to the Green Ox Clan."
<br><br>"Go, inform those few personal disciples of mine, at all costs, to chase those female disciples of the Green Bull Sect, one by one, to be a daoist couple."
<br><br>"Immediately send an invitation to the Green Bull Sect, saying that Taiyi Valley is willing to alliance with the Green Bull Sect, no matter what happens in the future, the same reason to link branches, and at the same time prepare a big gift to go over, as my Taiyi Valley's sincerity."
<br><br>After arranging all this, the four people who originally swept towards the clans actually reversed their direction in unison.
<br><br>"Never, let them take advantage of the first opportunity!"
<br><br>The four people played the same attention and stepped into the air in the same direction.
<br><br>Day.
<br><br>Passing peacefully.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood with his hands in the air, looking at the big mountain in the distance.
<br><br>"In another half month, I should be able to get the sect disciple's token."
<br><br>As soon as he thought of this, his heart became stupidly excited.
<br><br>After he got the disciple token, he could break away from the Green Ox Sect and go back to Pingjiang City to create a sect.
<br><br>He could take in a hundred more disciples.
<br><br>He will be able to complete his task and successfully embark on the path of cultivation.
<br><br>Speaking of a hundred disciples ......
<br><br>His gaze quietly glanced at the cloud dance and Wu Tao next to him.
<br><br>To be honest, he had long had his heart set on these two, and had made up his mind to coax them to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Because it can be seen, cloud dance to cultivation is not much heart, compared to the carving and painting he taught more interested in, want to coax should not be difficult.
<br><br>As for Wu Tao.
<br><br>This kid is an honest person, should also be easy.
<br><br>This is not.
<br><br>A hundred people solved two people in an instant!
<br><br>Beautiful!
<br><br>While Yi Feng was living a peaceful life in the Green Ox Sect, the entire Immortal River Continent was in a big turmoil.
<br><br>First, an old man named Qing Huan Xiang suddenly appeared.
<br><br>With a tough stance, he appeared among the major top powers.
<br><br>The opening words were.
<br><br>"I heard that your clan has a Book of Heavenly Dao?"
<br><br>"If there is indeed one, then I will give you a chance to hand over the book."
<br><br>Such a blatant robbery of people's heavy treasures and saying that they would give them a chance, never seen such a shameless person.
<br><br>This rampant tone aroused the hatred of the major powers.
<br><br>Dozens of great powers gathered and chased after Qing Huan Xiang.
<br><br>The result was that they were slapped over to the ground collectively by Qing Huan Xiang.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The shadow that Qing Huan phase brought to the major powers of the continent has not yet disappeared, there is another dog, a bear, a centipede, led by a black-robed man appeared across the sky.
<br><br>They started from the East Victory Local, like locusts, and ravaged the West Demon Forest, the South Desolate Domain, and the North Sea Land.
<br><br>Then, they came directly to the Central Continent.
<br><br>At this moment, the Middle Continent was having a martial arts conference, and hundreds of large and small sects were gathered here.
<br><br>The sky shadow attacked.
<br><br>First, the centipede, black bear plus dog combination appeared, followed by a black-robed man strutting in the air.
<br><br>Under the gaze of hundreds of large and small clans, this black-robed man forked his waist.
<br><br>"Skeleton Grand Master is here, hand over all your demonic beasts, foreign pets, and divine beasts in the town mountain."
<br><br>Chapter Three.
