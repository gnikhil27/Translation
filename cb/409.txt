At this moment, Ye Yi straight feel like her head is going to explode.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What kind of terrifying cultivation level is this?
<br><br>It was actually able to kill the seven Martial Emperors with the power of a mortal without exerting any immortal cultivator power, chopping up vegetables like a melon?
<br><br>She couldn't help but glance at Yi Feng.
<br><br>This one, is he an immortal?
<br><br>At the same time, she also suddenly understood why Yi Feng emphasized that he was a mortal.
<br><br>I heard that there are many big people who call themselves mortals and like this kind of low-key life, I'm afraid that also this one in front of me, is such a big person!
<br><br>So Ye Yi also had the sense not to pick this layer of window paper, and the address to Yi Feng also changed from senior to sir.
<br><br>"Well, let's part on this."
<br><br>After a slight exchange of pleasantries, Yi Feng rushed towards the distant city. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back as he stepped forward, Ye Yi felt a bit like a dream.
<br><br>Today, she had witnessed the fall of seven Martial Emperors.
<br><br>What's more, she didn't expect that she would actually be able to deal with an Immortal level figure in her lifetime.
<br><br>"Miss, we'd better hurry up and leave!" Xiaochun said in a hurry.
<br><br>Xiaochun's words pulled Ye Yi back to reality.
<br><br>She gave a bitter smile and said, "Leave, where can we go?"
<br><br>"But but ......"
<br><br>Xiaochun was full of anxiety and said, "But Master said, no matter where you go, you have to leave the North Sea as soon as possible!"
<br><br>Ye Yi shook her head lostly and said, "Xiaochun, I figured it out, I don't plan to leave."
<br><br>"Ah, Miss you?"
<br><br>Xiaochun's face changed and she quickly said, "Have you really thought about it, Miss?"
<br><br>"Thought it over."
<br><br>Ye Yi nodded solemnly, took off a storage ring and said, "This storage ring is for you, there are quite a lot of cultivation resources inside, you have good talent, find a place to hide and cultivate well."
<br><br>"What kind of words are you saying, Miss?"
<br><br>Xiaochun said unhappily: "If you really want to go back, then Xiaochun is definitely to go back with you, to die is also to die with you, Miss."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Ye Yi looked at Xiaochun with a stern face.
<br><br>Xiaochun half-heartedly did not retreat, full of determination.
<br><br>"Okay, fine."
<br><br>Seeing that Xiaochun was so determined, Ye Yi sighed and her tall body swept up into the air, leading Xiaochun one after the other towards the direction she came from.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>Finally, we arrived.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the city perched in front of him and finally let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>This time out, it was considered to have seen the world once.
<br><br>Perhaps it was because there was only this one city in this vicinity, so Guan Tong City was bigger than any city he had ever seen in Dongsheng.
<br><br>Coiled up in front like a mighty lion, the majestic appearance was also full of age.
<br><br>According to the records.
<br><br>In the ancient times of the Immortal River Continent, spiritual energy was very prosperous.
<br><br>At that time, all kinds of talented demon talents emerged, there was no shortage of genius sects would only absorb disciples once every ten years, so those who were slightly less talented could not enter the sect even if they broke their heads.
<br><br>But later, due to the impact of some heaven and earth turmoil, the spiritual energy of the Immortal River continent became very thin, resulting in the proportion of cultivators in the population, less and less.
<br><br>In this way, clans that originally had no shortage of disciples became very scarce.
<br><br>There are many small sects that even fight over less talented disciples. After all, for the clan, the population is the root of the clan's strength, by chance, there are people with average talent roots in history, because of various opportunities and efforts, but also become wonderfully great generation.
<br><br>So in today's world, as long as you have the root of cultivation, there is no fear of not being able to enter the clan.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The requirements of the great sects are still quite high, at least to achieve a certain cultivation talent to enter. But the disciples who have reached this standard will also cause the big sects to fight for them.
<br><br>Today, Yi Feng came across a big event in Guan Tong City.
<br><br>The bigwigs of several big clans in the North Sea came to Guan Tong City to talk about their business, and because of the decreasing talent in recent years, they joined forces in passing to organize a big blood absorption.
<br><br>Yi Feng followed the crowd to the central square.
<br><br>On the high platform of the central square, there stood several camps of people.
<br><br>They held flying swords in their hands, emitting a thick aura, not angry, and were cultivators at first glance.
<br><br>"It would be great if I could absorb into it."
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart leaped with joy.
<br><br>After understanding, Yi Feng found that the rules were simple.
<br><br>There was a registration office next to it, so as long as you went there to register and passed the test, you would be able to enter the center of the square and become a member of the pending candidates.
<br><br>Then the major sects will select from among the candidates, and those who are selected will be able to enter their sects.
<br><br>There were a lot of people testing, and Yi Feng followed the long line and got in line.
<br><br>The talent test is a bit like the interview in the previous life, one by one, if you can pass, if you can't, then return the way you came.
<br><br>Although there are many people in line, but the detection of people inside, 99 out of 100 is not passed, it can be seen, there are many people are to try their luck, after all, if really tested talent, and then selected by the sect, is undoubtedly a carp jumping dragon door.
<br><br>So the part that passed attracted the envious eyes of countless people.
<br><br>After two hours of waiting, it was finally Yi Feng's turn.
<br><br>"Whew."
<br><br>At the door, Yi Feng took a deep breath, and then walked in.
<br><br>The one in charge of the test was a thin man with an inverted eight-letter beard, and when he saw Yi Feng enter, he faintly skimmed Yi Feng.
<br><br>Although he was not strong, only a Martial Master, he could tell with one glance that Yi Feng had no talent and no cultivation.
<br><br>"Let's go."
<br><br>He waved his hand.
<br><br>"No test?" Yi Feng asked in confusion.
<br><br>"No need to test, I can tell with one glance that you have no talent." The man said impatiently, "Hurry up and go, don't delay the ones behind you."
<br><br>"Don't."
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart was anxious, it was hard to wait in such a long line, he was really reluctant ah, in case the test came out.
<br><br>A gnash of teeth, a heavy bag fell to the table.
<br><br>The thin man's eyes were raised and his gaze looked at the money bag.
<br><br>Although he is a martial artist, but inside the sect is actually like that, so the money is still useful to him, but also can buy some low-level cultivation resources.
<br><br>Plus he had been sitting for most of the day and none of them had opened their eyes, so at the moment he was moved.
<br><br>"Come with me."
<br><br>He silently put away the money bag and took Yi Feng to the side.
<br><br>"This is the talent testing stone, put your hand on it, no reaction means you have no cultivation talent, it will glow means you have cultivation talent, and the more the glow is, the stronger the talent is."
<br><br>He introduced it to Yi Feng in a smooth flow.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng walked to the talent stone and slightly raised his palm.
<br><br>Then, gently put it down.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>The moment he placed his palm down, the Talent Stone steeply cracked.
<br><br>Kam!
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng directly cursed.
<br><br>This was not the first time this had happened to him, and he did not expect this Talent Stone to crack again.
<br><br>As for the light, it was not even gross.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>The thin man saw this and frowned slightly, murmuring, "How come this talent stone is so unforgiving, so quickly crippled?"
<br><br>He put away the remnants and repositioned a talent stone on it.
<br><br>He didn't have the slightest doubt at all about Yi Feng's detection of letting the talent stone crack.
<br><br>After all, talent stones all have a lifespan, and things like cracking happen from time to time, except that this talent stone has a shorter lifespan, and Yi Feng happened to be better.
<br><br>"Then I this ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Young man, forget it, when a mortal is also quite good."
<br><br>Because Yi Feng brought him the only oil and water, so the man's attitude towards Yi Feng is slightly better, he softly comforted.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>A money bag fell on his feet.
<br><br>The skinny man immediately glared at Yi Feng and lectured in a decisive tone, "A dead one is a dead one, don't you come to this, there is no way I can promise you."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, another money bag landed at his feet.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Said impossible is impossible, in case it is found out, you and I can't eat!"
<br><br>He said in a deep voice.
<br><br>There is not the slightest room for negotiation.
<br><br>But the words fell, another ten money bags fell to his feet.
<br><br>Seeing this, the thin man suddenly laughed and gave a bear hug to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Young man ah, just now you came in I think you have hope, is a talent, really is not what I expected ah!"
<br><br>He patted Yi Feng's shoulder gratefully.
<br><br>"Congratulations, just now before the test stone cracked, I think I saw a glimmer of light, barely qualified!"
