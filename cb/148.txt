This is ......
<br><br>This is the descendant of the ancient gods?
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's heart was flooded with shocking waves, his eyes staring deadly at Zhong Qing, his mouth pumping backwards with cold air.
<br><br>If he wasn't obsessed with ancient books and loved to study the forgotten stories of history, I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to recognize this kind of super meridian.
<br><br>According to legend, when the Immortal River Continent had just opened up the heavens and the earth, ten thousand tribes were in existence, and in order to compete for the right to speak on the continent, various tribes started a million-year-long war.
<br><br>At that time, living beings and spirits were in ruins.
<br><br>And the human race compared to the ten thousand races, in addition to breeding powerful, there is no one skill, the most depressed time is close to extinction.
<br><br>But at this time, a group of people suddenly appeared among the human race.
<br><br>They have great strength, with a completely different meridian structure, leading the human race to fight back, and in less than ten thousand years, dominated the entire continent, but also let the human race become the master of all races.
<br><br>It can be said that without them, there would be no human today.
<br><br>The world in order to praise them, Gu called them the gods. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But perhaps it is the reason of heavenly jealousy, the people of the Gods did not long reproduce, long ago died out in the long history.
<br><br>Later in the continent's five million years of history, also found a few cases of descendants of the gods, without exception, have become the continent trembling three trembling figures, only, even the most recent case, also in two million years ago.
<br><br>By now, this kind of meridian has long been extinct.
<br><br>Even if there really is, it is impossible to be discovered, because after five million years of various genetic and bloodline, even if you have a divine meridian, it is also hidden completely so that people do not notice, but also more excited not out.
<br><br>And want to stimulate this bloodline, only let people on the verge of death, and then to the supreme product medicine to promote it, empty one of two opportunities!
<br><br>A thought to this, Lu Qingshan will be shocked gaze at Yi Feng, full of admiration.
<br><br>No wonder!
<br><br>No wonder!
<br><br>Zhong Qing, a waste of material, could be accepted as a disciple by Mr. Zhong Qing, so he was a descendant of the gods, and Mr. Zhong Qing must have already seen through the identity of Zhong Qing's descendants of the gods.
<br><br>And I'm afraid that everything that happened in Pingjiang City was also a set-up by Mr..
<br><br>Otherwise, a small mortal Chamber of Commerce, how could Zhong Qing be injured under the watchful eye of Mr., but coincidentally, a serious injury?
<br><br>When the initial struggle to figure out everything, now clear.
<br><br>It turns out that all of this was done with the tacit approval of Mr. Zhong Qing in order to stimulate his divine bloodline!
<br><br>This layout, horrible as this!
<br><br>Lu Qingshan drew a breath, and at the same time felt doubly honored, not only was he fortunate enough to be a pawn in his predecessor's game, but he was also fortunate enough to witness the awakening of a descendant of the God race.
<br><br>He couldn't help but look at Yi Feng and said with admiration, "Sir, you are great!"
<br><br>"It's just a small thing, as expected."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, this time into the mountain took so much time, and how could not have some certainty to let Zhong Qing wake up.
<br><br>"Little thing, expected!
<br><br>The old ancestor of Mount Qing could not help but smack his lips again.
<br><br>I wonder to what extent Mr. will this heavenly opportunity to calculate, to be able to say such sworn words.
<br><br>After all, this approach to awakening the chance of only one or two percent ah, and to be able to say such confident words, I'm afraid that before, Yi Feng also laid out many of his invisible bureau it!
<br><br>Lu Qingshan was overwhelmed with emotion.
<br><br>He found that Yi Feng was really refreshing his ceiling again and again.
<br><br>I thought his horizons were wide enough now, but until today, when he witnessed the awakening of the Gods, he realized that what he had seen before was only the tip of the iceberg. I really do not know what kind of incredible things he will witness in this one.
<br><br>And how it will be, refreshing the perception of others.
<br><br>"Well, let this precious disciple of mine rest!" Yi Feng looked at the medicine jar in his hand, found that there is still a small half of the medicine, hesitated for a moment towards the old ancestor of the green hill said, "is the medicine three points poison, since the apprentice has woken up, this medicine is not appropriate to drink again, there is still a little how about you drink it, this medicine efficacy is very much, you an old man to make up a tonic is also good."
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>See this medicine jar handed over, the old ancestor of Castle Peak excited heart almost jumped out, trembling hands said: "Sir, sir really give me?"
<br><br>"I can't say false?" With Zhong Qing waking up, Yi Feng was in a good mood and said jokingly, "Consider it a reward for you for helping me out!"
<br><br>"Reward!"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Mount Qing's body trembled slightly.
<br><br>This pawn of his, apart from exterminating the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, had done nothing else, and hadn't even played a key role, yet he was given such a blessing ......
<br><br>"Thank you, sir!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan solemnly accepted the medicine jar and bowed deeply towards Yi Feng before saying goodbye and leaving.
<br><br>After walking out of the martial school, the old ancestor of Qingshan still did not forget to bow in the direction of the martial school, and then flew towards the Qingshan Gate with the pill jar in his hand.
<br><br>"Master, what exactly happened to the gentleman disciple just now?"
<br><br>Back at the Castle Peak Sect, Luo Lanxue then hurriedly asked.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the Castle Peak Elder took a deep breath and looked at Luo Lanxue with a solemn face.
<br><br>"Ah Xue'er, congratulations, you have become the only lucky child in the entire Immortal River Continent for nearly two million years!"
