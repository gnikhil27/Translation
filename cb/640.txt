"There is absolutely no mistake, it is the Human Immortal!"
<br><br>Bai Fan said categorically, "My subordinates have had close contact with them, and they are definitely not the kind of high level people who hide their cultivation."
<br><br>"That's strange!"
<br><br>Soga Rentu couldn't help but ponder, and then asked, "Then she, did she get any other bottom card, or rather, any immortal weapon?"
<br><br>"This, even if she has the bottom card and immortal weapon, she will not tell her subordinates!" Bai Fan said.
<br><br>"Let's put it another way, have you ever seen anything on her that you haven't seen before?" Soga Rentu asked again.
<br><br>After such a reminder, Bai Fan's eyes lit up and said, "Yes!"
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>Soga Rentu asked.
<br><br>"It's a pile of pots and pans!" Bai Fan said.
<br><br>"?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"?"
<br><br>Soga Rentu had a question mark on his face, "Pots and pans?"
<br><br>"Not bad continental lord, is the pots and pans, is the recent days, I see Jiang to take them every day to wipe, watch!" Bai Fan said.
<br><br>"Pots and pans ......"
<br><br>Soga Rentu muttered.
<br><br>It baffled him in a fathomless way.
<br><br>"Then did you feel anything unusual on these pots and pans, breath ah, fluctuations or something?" Soga Rentu guessed again, "Is it possible that these pots and pans are blindfolds, but in reality they are some kind of divine weapons?"
<br><br>"Impossible!"
<br><br>"Absolutely not possible!"
<br><br>Bai Fan firmly said, "Once when she took out these pots and pans to study, my subordinate stood behind him and observed carefully, the bowl was a bowl and the basin was a basin!"
<br><br>"Sure?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>At these words, Soga Rentu revealed a look of relief.
<br><br>He had followed Jiang Zhi for so many years, and even when Jiang Zhi was imprisoned in Shadow Island, he had never underestimated Jiang Zhi.
<br><br>Especially this time when Jiang Zhi was coming back, he was always wary of what cards Jiang Zhi had.
<br><br>And now look.
<br><br>He was redundant.
<br><br>A person just released from the Shadow Island, how can have any big cards.
<br><br>I'm afraid.
<br><br>He was also overwhelmed by hatred.
<br><br>"In that case, then let this Jiang Zhi let his horse come!" Soga Rentu sneered.
<br><br>"The continent lord itself is overly worried, now that Lady Qinglian and the Desolate Continent Lord are still in the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent, how could Jiang Zhi move you?"
<br><br>"To take a step back, nowadays, you are holding a mid-level immortal weapon, that Jiang Zhi has long been unable to match you." Bai Fan said complimentingly.
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>Soga Rentu's head lifted slightly.
<br><br>He was extremely flattered.
<br><br>"Very good, you did a good job this time, when you return, reward you greatly!"
<br><br>Soga Rentu said appreciatively.
<br><br>"Yes, thank you, Lord of the Continent, I will definitely work hard, and when there is news from this side, I will definitely inform you at the first time!"
<br><br>......
<br><br>Shortly after.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi and his group stepped onto the flying boat and departed for the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Also at the same time when Jiang Zhi was busy with his personal affairs, Gong Chen also said hello to Yi Feng and walked out of the Dark Shadow Island alone.
<br><br>He then rushed towards the West Ning Continent, one of the three continents, without stopping.
<br><br>Before he was imprisoned in the Dark Shadow Island, he was an elder of one of the clans in the West Ning Continent.
<br><br>"I'm finally back!"
<br><br>Gong Chen looked up at the mountain gate in front of him and was filled with emotion.
<br><br>He had never thought.
<br><br>One day, he would be able to come back here.
<br><br>He did not cause any commotion and quietly entered the mountain gate and arrived inside the sect.
<br><br>Inside a partial hall.
<br><br>Noisy voices came from it.
<br><br>"Rebel son, you rebel son!"
<br><br>"What kind of you don't you have a little bit of pussy in your own heart?"
<br><br>"You still have a one-year appointment, you have an appointment, my ass!"
<br><br>A middle-aged man with a face full of anger was counting a youth.
<br><br>"Father, that woman has come to the door to withdraw from the marriage, do you think this kind of thing, can be tolerated?" The youth shouted reluctantly.
<br><br>"Then what can you do if you can't stand it?" The man drank angrily, "How are you going to beat her in a year?"
<br><br>"By then, won't it be even more humiliating for you to be defeated by her in front of countless people and then withdraw from the marriage!"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The youth's eyes were scarlet, clenched his fist to death, and blasted his fist on the wall, venting his unwillingness.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The man was a little distressed again, and hurriedly went to comfort the youth.
<br><br>"Alas, it's all my fault, unable to deal with the problems in your cultivation, which led to ......" the man sighed, in this moment, as if aged several points.
<br><br>"Father, it's all my own waste!"
<br><br>The youth also clenched his teeth and blamed himself.
<br><br>"Heh, what's all the noise, make like what!"
<br><br>Just at this time, an abrupt voice outside the door sounded.
<br><br>"Who?"
<br><br>The man shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>Then it was to see that Gong Chen walked in from outside the door with a smiling face.
<br><br>"Senior brother?"
<br><br>"Senior Brother Gong Chen?"
<br><br>The father and son turned their astonished eyes to Gong Chen and shocked him, "Weren't you locked up in Dark Shadow Island, how come you came out?"
<br><br>Gong Chen smiled lightly and sat down on the table, laughing leisurely, "Senior brother, don't be so surprised, just come out from the Dark Shadow Island, what a big deal!"
<br><br>The father and son had a question mark on their faces.
<br><br>From the Shadow Island, how big a deal?
<br><br>Is that human talk?
<br><br>Even if you are lucky to come out of the Shadow Island, don't be so floating!
<br><br>But after they reacted, they were surprised and asked Gong Chen all sorts of questions.
<br><br>For the things on the Shadow Island, Gong Chen kept his mouth shut.
<br><br>Just directly asked, "Senior brother, what the hell just happened?"
<br><br>Once this was said, the man sighed and did not inquire what was going on with Gong Chen.
<br><br>"Alas, senior brother."
<br><br>"It's not like you don't know about Chong'er's condition."
<br><br>"These years have not been much improvement, this is not now almost to the consummation of the marriage with the Thousand Seekers Sect Saint Maiden!"
<br><br>"But who knows, two days ago the Thousand Seekers Sect came to withdraw from the marriage, Chong'er in a fit of anger with that saint girl made a one-year contract, said to defeat her within a year!"
<br><br>Said, the man rubbed up his forehead.
<br><br>A face of worry.
<br><br>"Thousand Seekers Clan?"
<br><br>"Hasn't this crappy sect of theirs always relied on our Great Harmony Sect, how dare they be so bold as to back out of a marriage with Chong'er?" Gong Chen said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"Alas, you are unaware."
<br><br>"After you were imprisoned in Dark Shadow Island, this Thousand Seekers Sect's Saintess Li Qingxuan awakened the Desolate Ancient Immortal Body."
<br><br>"And she was also accepted as a personal disciple by our West Ning Continent Lord."
<br><br>"That is to say, now that the Thousand Seekers Sect has the backing of the West Ning Continent Lord, it has no need for my Great Harmony Sect, and only then did it come to withdraw from the marriage."
<br><br>The man sighed and said, "You said that under such circumstances, how could Chong'er be a match for that Li Qingxuan in a year's time!"
<br><br>"So I was teaching him a lesson, it would be better to simply agree to withdraw the marriage, lose some face, it's better than losing face in front of countless people in the ring a year later!" The man shook his head and said.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Gong Chen, who understood the cause and effect, laughed out loud.
<br><br>With an appreciative face, he looked at Lu Chong.
<br><br>"Ah Chong'er, well done, it's good that you didn't agree to withdraw from the marriage, otherwise you would have lost all your face." Gong Chen said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The man Lu Zun was instantly confused.
<br><br>Including Lu Chong himself.
<br><br>"Senior brother, are you not listening?" Lu Zun couldn't help but say, "Not agreeing to withdraw the marriage is not a loss of face now, but what about a year later?"
<br><br>"What are you going to do to make Chon'er defeat Li Qingxuan in a year's time?"
