The annual poetry conference finally opened on the banks of the Pure River in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Here.
<br><br>Gathered the entire Pingjiang City's young talent.
<br><br>Here, not by strength, not by family history on the high and low, only by literature on the style.
<br><br>Of course, said the mortal activities, but not only mortals can participate, cultivators can also be, but even if the cultivators here, you do not have a good literary connotation, but also be looked down upon.
<br><br>Literati style, that's it!
<br><br>Yi Feng, who received an invitation, also came to the poetry conference.
<br><br>In the conference, there were many people fiddling with their verses, fiddling with their literary skills, but none of them could arouse Yi Feng's interest.
<br><br>He grew up in the culture of five thousand years, all kinds of ancient verses, poems he has long known how much, these surface looks rhyme, in fact, on the meaning of the poems are not, really can not attract his interest.
<br><br>Even in his novel recitation of the three hundred Tang poems, it is enough to crush these people.
<br><br>However. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In the crowded crowd, however, there were two gazes always watching him.
<br><br>One, was Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>The other, was Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>Finally, Demon Ling'er took a deep breath and walked over towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Oops!"
<br><br>Just as she approached Yi Feng, Demon Ling'er stumbled.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng didn't even look at her and walked directly past her, just like that, Demon Ling'er fell for nothing!
<br><br>"Girl, are you okay?"
<br><br>"Girl, how are you?"
<br><br>For a time, seeing such a stunning beauty as Demon Ling'er fall to the ground, countless literati flocked to the ground, the support wanted to pick up Demon Ling'er, the transmission sent gentle concern to Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>"Get lost."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's face sank.
<br><br>These mortal-like ants were not worthy to touch her at all.
<br><br>Just him, why did he turn a blind eye to himself?
<br><br>Could it be that she, herself, really couldn't get his attention?
<br><br>A touch of worry unknowingly appeared in Demon Ling'er's eyes.
<br><br>"Hello, sir."
<br><br>And at this time, Mao Yun'er walked over towards Yi Feng in due course, with a pretty red face, greeted Yi Feng.
<br><br>"It's you ah ......"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er Yi Feng has seen after all, but the face is not how good.
<br><br>Seeing Mao Yun'er, he remembered Mao Yun'er's father Mao Lin, the humiliation to him that day was not forgotten, so Yi Feng just a simple greeting, then brushed past her.
<br><br>For a time, leaving Mao Yun'er alone in the same place secretly hurt.
<br><br>"You're a tiny mortal, could you possibly attract the attention of sir, what a laugh." Just at that moment, Demon Ling'er walked up to Mao Yun'er's side and said icily.
<br><br>"What are you again?" Mao Yun'er frowned, feeling an absolute crisis in this woman's body, especially, her water snake-like figure, giving her a great sense of crisis.
<br><br>"Me?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er sneered.
<br><br>"I am a figure beyond your reach, want to Rran finger sir, you are not worthy!"
<br><br>Demon spirit child mocked, then gazed at Yi Feng's back and continued to follow.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er secretly gritted her teeth, although this woman's posture made her feel absolutely threatened, but when she thought about it, she was definitely not bad either.
<br><br>Inevitably, Mao Yun'er, who was unwilling to concede defeat, also chased towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yi Feng."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was weaving through the crowd, watching the poems written by one of the otherworldly scribes, suddenly heard someone call out to him.
<br><br>Turning his head, a complicated look appeared on his face.
<br><br>The person who shouted at him was none other than Peng Ying.
<br><br>"I didn't expect to see you here."
<br><br>Peng Ying said coldly, his posture was not like before, and he seemed to speak with a tone full of hatred.
<br><br>"Yeah, didn't expect to see you here again."
<br><br>Yi Feng felt quite complicated.
<br><br>He was not a heartless person, but neither was he a saintly mother's heart.
<br><br>When Peng Ying ruthlessly left that day, although Yi Feng was sad, he was also clean and straightforward and crossed Peng Ying out in his heart.
<br><br>To this woman, he has long since not a single fluctuation.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, I have inquired clearly, don't think that you can do anything because you wrote a good book and let Luo Lanxue of the Castle Peak Sect cover you, you have to understand that you are a mortal after all." Peng Ying mocked nonchalantly, "Although I was expelled from the Mountain Sect by the Green Mountain Sect, but Brother Wu Jie has already sent me a letter, and in no time, I will return to the Green Mountain Sect."
<br><br>"In my eyes, you are a mortal after all, a mole."
<br><br>Peng Ying coldly mocked.
<br><br>She held a grudge for what happened that day, especially after being expelled from the Castle Peak Sect, it was even harder for her to let go.
