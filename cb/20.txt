 "Huh."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly while extending the chopper and said, "Here you go."
<br><br>As soon as Yi Feng's words fell, the qi and blood of the old ancestor of Qingshan swelled and felt unable to breathe.
<br><br>Sure enough!
<br><br>The senior had already seen through his thoughts of coming here, and before he could say anything, he directly took the knife out.
<br><br>This kind of great kindness.
<br><br>It simply made him fill with hot tears.
<br><br>"Master Yi's great kindness, Qingshan will never forget it." Both hands solemnly and tremblingly received the kitchen knife in Yi Feng's hand, the old ancestor of Qingshan was so excited that he directly knelt down.
<br><br>On the side, Zhu Yun also reacted.
<br><br>Also finally understood that the knife Old Ancestor Qingshan was talking about was the kitchen knife in front of him.
<br><br>No wonder when the whole clan is worried about the Xuanwu old ancestor, as the party concerned, the old ancestor of Qingshan can still maintain his composure, said to go to borrow a knife. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At first he did not feel that there is any knife can top the Martial King realm ten years of cultivation, but now look, his heart's concerns have been dispelled all.
<br><br>Followed by the old ancestor of Castle Peak, also kneeled down towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What are you guys doing, get up quickly." Seeing the two actually kneeled down, Yi Feng hurriedly went to help the two.
<br><br>But the two stubbornly kowtowed heavily on the ground a few times before they would get up.
<br><br>"Alas, why are you guys doing this, it's just a kitchen knife?" Yi Feng lamented.
<br><br>The reason why he took the kitchen knife to the old ancestor of Qingshan is also because last time when we cooked together, we had heard the old ancestor of Qingshan recite that it would be good for him to have a kitchen knife like this.
<br><br>He could see that the old man's desire to have a kitchen knife at home. It just so happens that he built a new one, and the old one is no longer usable, so he gave it directly to the old man.
<br><br>This world, the rich are rich, the poor are truly poor.
<br><br>Especially like Qingshan this, it is estimated that a decent kitchen knife at home do not have, do not know how they usually cut vegetables, but also may be directly screwed with the hands ......
<br><br>Alas!
<br><br>So thinking about it, Yi Feng also quite understand that they are so excited, maybe this knife for them is a blessing in the snow!
<br><br>"It's true that to you, Master Yi, it's just a kitchen knife, but to me, it's like sending charcoal in the snow!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan said excitedly.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed slightly and felt quite saddened for Old Ancestor Qing Shan.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan carefully put away the kitchen knife, and his gratitude to Yi Feng went straight to the sky.
<br><br>I thought that the trip to borrow the knife was difficult, after all, this is such a high-grade divine object, he and Yi Feng is only a one-sided acquaintance, people are willing to borrow his heart is not really bottom.
<br><br>But who would have thought that the senior had foresight to give him the knife without waiting for him to ask.
<br><br>With this knife, he has full confidence and Xuanwu old man battle. This not only saved his Castle Peak Ancestor, but also saved his entire Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>Therefore, it was not in the least bit too much to bow down to Yi Feng.
<br><br>After a long, long time, the two people only slightly calmed down from the surprise, not as out of shape as before.
<br><br>"Master Yi, it is difficult for me, Qingshan, to repay your kindness, even though I know that what I have is not worth mentioning to you, but I still ask you to accept it." Saying that, Old Ancestor Qingshan took out a fire-red bead from his storage bag.
<br><br>As soon as the bead was taken out, the temperature of the entire surrounding continued to rise.
<br><br>"Master ...... uncle, flame bead!" On the side, Zhu Yun exclaimed, also did not expect that the old ancestor of Qingshan Mountain actually took out the treasure of the town of Qingshan Mountain Sect.
<br><br>But think about it, can borrow the treasure sword in the hands of the senior, pay a flame bead and what is it.
<br><br>"Master Yi, please also be sure to accept it."
<br><br>Old Grandmaster Qing Shan bowed and held the flame bead with both hands and raised it to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"This thing ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng speculated on the flame bead and found that it was red in color and emitted a very high temperature from within, and did not know that it was pulled out from inside that volcanic lump.
<br><br>Of course, this is after all the other world, this kind of strange and bizarre things are a lot, Yi Feng is not surprised, as a souvenir or quite good.
<br><br>"This thing is still quite pleasing to the eye, I like it very much, then I will accept it." Yi Feng also did not refuse Qingshan, he knew that Qingshan was a very polite, and characterful person.
<br><br>This kind of person is not too willing to take people's benefits directly.
<br><br>So if he refused, it would instead make Old Man Qingshan feel that it was something that he didn't see.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng accept it, the old ancestor of Castle Peak was relieved, but his face was also quite helpless.
<br><br>Before giving the gift, he actually racked a lot of brains, thinking before deciding to take out this flame bead, in his opinion, after all, is the treasure of his Castle Peak Gate, set aside in the eyes of this senior even if it is not the most precious, but also enough to make it stunning.
<br><br>But the result in his mouth, is just a decorative ornament, which makes the old ancestor of Castle Peak feel frustrated.
<br><br>It is true that the status is different, the eyesight is also very different ah!
<br><br>After repeatedly thanking him, the old ancestor of Castle Peak seemed to remember something and asked meaningfully, "Master Yi, I wonder what your future plans are, can you reveal them to my uncle and nephew?"
<br><br>At that, Zhu Yun on the side also opened his ears over.
