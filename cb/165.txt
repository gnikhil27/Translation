 "Enlightenment Enlightenment My Lords, the Heavenly Destiny Sign of the Xuluo Demon Sect and the Voodoo Demon Sect is broken." This subordinate shouted with a trembling voice, and when he finished, he knelt on the ground and trembled.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>One word set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>Including Ao Bi Fang and the others, all of them stood up almost at the same time.
<br><br>Terrifying aura in their bodies of these strong people turned, the whole lobby fiercely became oppressive to the extreme, countless items turned into powder, cultivation is a little weaker difficult to stand.
<br><br>To the demon emperor cultivation, basically will be left in the clan of the fate of the card, so they will always know the life and death of the clan members out.
<br><br>And the fate of the card cracked.
<br><br>It also means that the owner of the Heavenly Destiny plate has fallen.
<br><br>"Why is it like this, why is it like this?"
<br><br>Finally, after a short period of suppression, Ao Bi Fang's mouth shouted out a cold voice, and his body trembled as the body of the subordinate in front of him violently turned into a rain of blood.
<br><br>At this moment, his heart was simply dripping blood. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>To know, although his Red Sun lineage is powerful, but the Demon Sect is definitely the most top battle force, any one of them is a pillar-like existence, this instant loss of two.
<br><br>This kind of loss ......
<br><br>Not to mention that there is also the matter of Ao Qingcheng in front.
<br><br>"Ao Qing, Ao Qing, it's all because of this Ao Qing." Ao Bi Fang transmitted a gnashing voice and shouted in a deep voice: "Those above the Demon Emperor of the Red Sun lineage listen to the order, follow me and set off immediately!"
<br><br>"I want to see whether there is a dragon or a tiger lying next to this Ao Qing!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>All the experts spoke out in unison.
<br><br>Then as Ao Bi Fang chopped his feet and palms, more than twenty experts swept up to the high altitude in unison, causing a small shadow to appear on the ground.
<br><br>Among the more than twenty experts.
<br><br>There were seven Demon Sects and more than ten Demon Emperors.
<br><br>This kind of lineup could almost level most of the forces in the Southern Sands.
<br><br>Where they swept through, the whole space was with a strong sense of oppression, under the absolute killing intent, many birds that swept through the sky, within a hundred feet of approaching them, were directly shaken into powder.
<br><br>Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Drizzle is already stopped.
<br><br>But after the rain, the land is full of mud, and not good for work.
<br><br>So Yi Feng led, including Wu Yonghong, Chu Mad Lion, Sun Zhuge and other people are sitting in the martial arts school chatting, while chatting, Lu Qingshan also ran over.
<br><br>At one time.
<br><br>The martial arts school was bustling with activity.
<br><br>"Since there are so many people, plus it's a bit cold, why don't we get a hot pot to eat?" Yi Feng smiled and said towards the crowd.
<br><br>Hearing that Yi Feng wants to make something to eat, the crowd where there is no opinion, are looking forward to nodding their heads.
<br><br>"But you guys have to help together, I'm sure I can't get it over alone." Yi Feng said again.
<br><br>"What do you need us to do, sir, just give us an order." The people said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Good, old man Wu you three will help me clean up the meat!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, just what to eat but a little makes him a difficult choice.
<br><br>He wanted to get a whole roasted lamb.
<br><br>Also want to get an eagle stew.
<br><br>But after thinking about it, it seemed good to make a wolf meat casserole porridge.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he simply took out the spatial ring.
<br><br>Seeing his spatial ring, the crowd immediately stared at him, filled with shock.
<br><br>Obviously, they could also see the miraculousness of this ring, which was by no means comparable to an ordinary storage ring.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, this ring is okay, right!" Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads in a hurry.
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corner of his mouth, to their group of hicks gaze also expressed understanding, after all, he this ring is a cultivator gave him something, they a few mortal little old man where to see.
<br><br>"What to eat specifically you guys choose!"
<br><br>Yi Feng directly open the ring of space, a brain will be inside the beast all poured out.
<br><br>Such as leopard ah, eagle ah, snake ah, deer ah ...... almost everything, almost piled up the entire courtyard.
<br><br>This time, directly Wu Yonghong and other people's eyes were shocked almost fell out.
<br><br>"That's a lightning eagle?"
<br><br>"That's a land snake!"
<br><br>"That, that's a flying wolf!"
<br><br>The group was directly stunned, because these things were actually either demon spirits or demon kings, although they had already guessed that the ingredients prepared by Yi Feng were not simple, but they never thought it was so uncomplicated.
<br><br>"Oh, I still have a king bark here!"
<br><br>Yi Feng took out the old Wangba again and said, "But this Wangba each of you can only have a mouthful of soup, I want to give my disciple's child to tonic the body."
<br><br>"Demon?"
<br><br>"Emperor!"
<br><br>Once this Wang Bajie came out, the crowd was even more stare smacking their lips.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan is even cold sweat, Wu Yonghong and others are still at least Martial Sect experts, he a little old brother who just entered the Martial Emperor, see this breakthrough demon emperor not know how many years old Wang Bajie, the mood is simply complicated to the extreme.
<br><br>This is stronger than him, so used to eat?
<br><br>Seniors are seniors.
<br><br>The gesture is big.
<br><br>But gradually, they are somewhat immune.
<br><br>After all, the existence of the demon sect can be killed in seconds, eat two demon spirit demon king and what is considered.
<br><br>They, on the contrary, can follow the blessing.
