Just like this.
<br><br>Yi Feng took Gong Chen both ends of the run, both ends live.
<br><br>To be honest.
<br><br>Gong Chen's performance still makes Yi Feng quite satisfied, just like his old servant, toil and grumble.
<br><br>And Yi Feng enjoy life every day, but also do not forget to think about the two questions.
<br><br>Where do I come from.
<br><br>Where to go?
<br><br>Mistake.
<br><br>What exactly is my cultivation level?
<br><br>My strength performance, why is it different from others'?
<br><br>"Hiss!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng thought of a possibility and drew a breath backwards.
<br><br>"Holy shit, I can't be a martial arts expert, right?"
<br><br>The more Yi Feng thought about it, the more likely it was.
<br><br>Look at what the system taught him?
<br><br>Taijiquan.
<br><br>Monkey steal peach child.
<br><br>Golden bell shield iron cloth shirts child ......
<br><br>And martial arts school.
<br><br>These things do not match with the cultivation of immortality, but rather the same as the martial arts films watched in the previous life.
<br><br>This is not a disguised statement, he is a martial arts master?
<br><br>This directly let Yi Feng a butt scared paralyzed on the ground.
<br><br>If it is a martial arts expert, then wouldn't you have a long life span like an immortal cultivator?
<br><br>Maybe after a few decades, get a cancer cold?
<br><br>Kam ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed in his heart.
<br><br>But then thought about it, and not right.
<br><br>If he is really a martial arts expert, it is impossible to beat the immortal cultivator ah, he waved his hand to kill thousands of disciples of the Sun Moon Peak feat, a martial arts expert can not explain ah!
<br><br>"Slap!"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave himself a slap.
<br><br>Do not want to.
<br><br>This motherfucker is to give himself trouble.
<br><br>Better think about it, take disciples of things.
<br><br>"Call the system."
<br><br>"You let me take the last apprentice, also have to give me an apprentice criteria, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"The standard is that there is no standard!"
<br><br>"System approval is fine."
<br><br>The system's voice came, causing Yi Feng to open his teeth and claws.
<br><br>Motherfucker.
<br><br>The hell knows how to get your approval.
<br><br>You say look at the talent, right, that talent detection function has long gone.
<br><br>You say look at the cultivation bar, he stood in the street a glance sweep over, all the same, he can not see any difference.
<br><br>Have to.
<br><br>All depends on fate.
<br><br>"Let it be!"
<br><br>Yi Feng returned to the courtyard, lying down on a recliner.
<br><br>Patted his belly.
<br><br>Anyway, that qi luck points can be purchased to extend, really can not, and then extend him two years.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>At this moment Yi Feng suddenly thought of a thing.
<br><br>That is, is it possible, to find the system help, to help him to the Immortal River continent island, to him to move to the Shadow Island?
<br><br>You think about it.
<br><br>When the Heaven and Earth Gate took him a lot of effort, the island was so well built, this time to the immortal world how to give up.
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately began to ask the system.
<br><br>"Ding, no."
<br><br>System voice came, let Yi Feng disappointed to the extreme.
<br><br>But the system's next voice made Yi Feng's eyes shine.
<br><br>"Ten thousand exchange points to establish a teleportation array between Heaven and Earth Gate and Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>"Yah!"
<br><br>"That's a good feeling!"
<br><br>Yi Feng jumped up in excitement.
<br><br>To be honest.
<br><br>He had come to the Immortal World for so long, he really missed the old men and women on the island.
<br><br>And his precious disciple Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Uh.
<br><br>And his group of mixed-up disciples, although not much affection, but also have the name of master and disciple.
<br><br>Maybe they can all be brought to the immortal world to open their eyes.
<br><br>Yi Feng opened the system exchange store.
<br><br>Sure enough, he found the exchange location, although this transmission array is a bit expensive, need 10,000 exchange points, but recently the immortal river continent to come to the qi luck points he has saved a lot.
<br><br>If you save up for another two months, it will be enough.
<br><br>And what makes Yi Feng even more surprised is that, perhaps because of the last system upgrade, resulting in the system exchange store, there is another cultivation exchange.
<br><br>One hundred thousand exchange points, can be exchanged for a level of cultivation.
<br><br>This instantly made Yi Feng jump up.
<br><br>"Dog thing ah dog thing, now life finally see a little hope!"
<br><br>Before.
<br><br>He, Yi Feng, was completely ignorant of cultivation.
<br><br>Couldn't cultivate, much less exhale and absorb qi.
<br><br>Even if the system does not move to reward him with a level 50 cultivation, but this kind of inexplicably obtained thing, so he is half-hearted.
<br><br>But now it's different.
<br><br>The 100,000 exchange points to rise a level, equivalent to a carrot a pit, at least he knows how to improve his cultivation.
<br><br>......
<br><br>But at this moment, the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>The streets are bustling with activity.
<br><br>Vendors hawking ......
<br><br>Still bustling with activity.
<br><br>Just occasionally there is a dung through, quite a big fuss about the scenery.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng picked a pair of dung buckets.
<br><br>He is looking at the ten young people in front of him with a serious face.
<br><br>Because of the growing Tiandi door, every day out of countless dung, so Lu Dasheng had to grow the organization.
<br><br>This is not.
<br><br>Ten saints were selected from the Lingxu Realm and accepted as disciples.
<br><br>"Remember."
<br><br>"The path of picking dung contains the Great Way."
<br><br>"To pick dung, first meditate, and moreover, be not afraid of others' eyes, before you can reach the peak."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng taught in a serious tone.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Ten young people respectfully answered, neatly and tidily picked up the dung bucket, and began the day's work in an orderly manner.
<br><br>And beyond the island.
<br><br>There was a man standing in mid-air.
<br><br>He was red-clothed and red-haired, and it was none other than Perdition, who had not seen him for many days.
<br><br>And beside him, there were ten men in armor.
<br><br>"Ten lords, according to the messenger's investigation, the loss of Qi of the Immortal River Continent is related to this small island!" Exterminator said respectfully.
