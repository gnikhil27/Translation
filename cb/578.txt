Gong Chen also lived up to his expectations.
<br><br>In just a few days, he found more than ten people for Yi Feng.
<br><br>These ten people did not believe in what Gong Chen said at first.
<br><br>But in Gong Chen insisted, the people reluctantly came to the courtyard, are Emma really fragrant.
<br><br>Also completely convinced by all the means of Yi Feng.
<br><br>So after coming here, each of them are dedicated to work, hoeing the hay, watering the water, simply any complaints.
<br><br>For these people's defection, Yi Feng is extremely satisfied.
<br><br>Every one of them is a reincarnation immortal realm ah.
<br><br>Every one of them swore to the heavens to be loyal to him.
<br><br>What does this mean? It means that in the future, when he leaves this island, he will be able to walk sideways.
<br><br>The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of a fight. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The first thing you can do is to become a big brother by accident.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, it's payday again.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host."
<br><br>"Received Immortal River Continent Qi Luck Points."
<br><br>"Qi luck points +600."
<br><br>"It's really on time."
<br><br>Yi Feng who had been waiting for a long time raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>It was waiting for this day.
<br><br>He couldn't wait to open the system, and after exchanging the extra Qi luck points for some household items and other saplings, Yi Feng locked his eyes to that teleportation.
<br><br>"I hope the dog system doesn't screw me over!"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his hands together.
<br><br>Then he clicked on the redemption.
<br><br>Instantly, a message appeared in his mind.
<br><br>The teleportation could be started immediately and would be randomly teleported to a certain area of the Immortal World.
<br><br>After the first teleportation, it would be branded with the coordinates of the two places, and from then on it would be possible to teleport back and forth near the coordinates, with a cooling time of one day.
<br><br>"Great!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was overjoyed.
<br><br>It seems that this time, the dog system did not pit him, can be considered to not have to ride slowly across the ocean.
<br><br>Soon he made preparations to go out and couldn't wait to see what the real Immortal World was really like.
<br><br>"Gong Chen ah, these saplings and seeds you instruct everyone at home to plant, other things you also busy first, I go out first!"
<br><br>Before leaving, Yi Feng patted Gong Chen's shoulder and explained.
<br><br>"Go out for a trip?"
<br><br>Gong Chen's eyes widened, shocked, "Senior, what you call going out, is leaving this Dark Shadow Island?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the rest of the dozen Reincarnation Immortal Realm powerhouses also looked their eyes over.
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded lightly.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Gong Chen and the others drew a breath backwards.
<br><br>To put it so lightly.
<br><br>Could it be that for this one, Dark Shadow Island was really a place to come and go whenever he wanted?
<br><br>For a while, the crowd looked at Yi Feng with anticipation.
<br><br>In their hearts, they guessed how Yi Feng actually left.
<br><br>Was it tearing through space?
<br><br>Or did he just fly out?
<br><br>A group of people waited expectantly.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The Yi Feng in front of him disappeared with a swish.
<br><br>The crowd's jaws dropped to the ground.
<br><br>Instant.
<br><br>Instantaneous?
<br><br>A group of people inside the courtyard almost exploded.
<br><br>This damn, what is the horror of the means?
<br><br>It was unheard of, unseen!
<br><br>"Too, too powerful."
<br><br>An expert gulped his saliva and said.
<br><br>"Gong Chen, you son of a bitch, tell me, how in the end did you hold this senior's leg."
<br><br>The crowd grabbed Gong Chen and turned their eyes towards him in unison.
<br><br>"What are you doing? What are you doing?"
<br><br>Gong Chen pulled away, with a face up chest a foul scolded: "How to talk, I know seniors that is the luck, why, you still want to cross the river to tear down the bridge can not, if not me, you can know seniors, now still nestled in the cave to eat dirt, right?"
<br><br>"Do not hurry to work, forget the senior's explanation?"
<br><br>Looking at Gong Chen's smug look, the crowd's eyes were on fire.
<br><br>They were even more envious and jealous.
<br><br>But there is no way to take him, who told him to know Yi Feng first.
<br><br>Tui.
<br><br>What a shitty luck.
<br><br>......
<br><br>The painting style changed.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up and a whole new environment appeared in front of him.
<br><br>Magnificent buildings.
<br><br>A huge square.
<br><br>The distant mountain peaks were draped with clouds and fog.
<br><br>A casual breath of fresh air gave a feeling of refreshment.
<br><br>"That's right!"
<br><br>"This is the true immortal world!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was overjoyed.
<br><br>Finally, he had come to the real immortal world.
<br><br>However, the shocked Yi Feng also found that there were people standing next to him.
<br><br>These people, in total, were divided into three groups, standing neatly and tidily. And Yi Feng happened to be transported into one of the groups.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>For Yi Feng's sudden appearance, there was actually not a single person on the scene who noticed.
<br><br>"First of all, congratulations on joining the Sun Moon Sect, you have all become disciples of my Sun Moon Sect at this moment."
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng was full of confusion, at the top, an old man emitted a flood bell-like voice, "Now listen to the order, all of you line up to report your identity names and receive disciple tokens."
<br><br>As his voice fell, the disciples began to line up and receive their identity tokens.
<br><br>And the Immortal World was really efficient.
<br><br>In a short while, it was Yi Feng's turn.
<br><br>"Name."
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his nose in confusion and saw the man in charge of registration glare his eyes at him, before he said breathlessly, "Yi Feng."
<br><br>The man smiled and waved his palm, and the word "Yi Feng" appeared on a token with the mark of the sun and moon on it.
<br><br>"Belong to Star Peak, keep your token and go back to your column."
<br><br>The man handed the token to him.
<br><br>Yi Feng took the token and walked back to his parade, patting his face, feeling so unbelievable.
<br><br>Himself just clicked on the teleportation.
<br><br>He teleported to the Sun Moon Sect's newly accepted disciple parade.
<br><br>Then he was given a disciple token in name only.
<br><br>And finally, coldly, became a disciple of the Sun Moon Sect Star Peak?
<br><br>What the hell, should it be so magical?
<br><br>"Tsk, Liu Yan, your Star Peak is really losing its way, look what kind of disciples you've taken in?"
<br><br>At the top of the three columns, there were three more people standing, and one of them, a man with an eight-character beard, emitted a mocking voice towards another woman with an enchanting figure and stunningly beautiful features.
<br><br>The man is the Sun Moon Sect Sun Moon Peak Peak Master Guo Shijie.
<br><br>And Liu Yan is the peak master of Star Peak where Yi Feng is.
<br><br>Hearing Guo Shijie's words, Liu Yan's pretty face was covered with frost, but did not reply.
<br><br>But Guo Shijie didn't seem to be ready to stop, but continued, "According to the usual practice, every time after absorbing fresh blood, there will be a big competition for new students, and looking at your Star Peak group of crooked children, I'm afraid this time your Star Peak will be at the bottom again."
<br><br>"Hmph, Guo Shijie, the competition hasn't even started yet, it's not clear who will have the last laugh." Liu Yan said with a cold face.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, you really don't die!" Guo Shijie sneered, "Look at our Sun and Moon Peak, more than ten Heavenly Immortals over there, not to mention the three geniuses I personally collected from the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom!"
<br><br>Follow the sound and look.
<br><br>Sure enough, at the head of the Sun Moon Clan, there were three cold-looking youths standing.
<br><br>These three youths Liu Yan saw through the strength at a glance, although it was nothing to her, but with their age, in this group of newly promoted disciples ......
<br><br>"Not bad, they are the most outstanding geniuses of the young generation of the Sword Valley Yu Family, triplets, at a young age, they have already reached the realm of Xuan Xian."
<br><br>"And on the contrary, you guys ......"
<br><br>"Take the hand, I'm afraid there is only a Yang Yi from Yun Lai country, right?"
<br><br>"But he is only half a foot into the Xuan Xian, not even one of the three brothers."
<br><br>The mocking words were harsh to the ears.
<br><br>It made Liu Yan clench her red lips and tightly pinch her jade hand.
<br><br>But she was powerless to refute.
<br><br>Because what Guo Shijie said was indeed the truth.
<br><br>Just then, Guo Shijie, who was scanning the Star Peak camp, seemed to have found something.
<br><br>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Yo."
<br><br>"This Star Peak is really lost, how come there is still a kid who can't see his cultivation, isn't it a human immortal?"
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>Liu Yan frowned slightly.
<br><br>Also followed the gaze to look.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>In her Star Peak's camp, found a youth who could not see the cultivation.
<br><br>"Why Liu Yan, why aren't you talking?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie laughed out loud.
<br><br>He didn't think that with his strength he couldn't see through a new disciple's cultivation, there was simply no other explanation than Human Immortal.
<br><br>Because Human Immortal cultivation, in the Immortal World, was the lowest level of existence, the Immortal Energy in his body was minimal, it was no different from a mortal.
<br><br>Liu Yan clenched his teeth, silent.
<br><br>"Oh, Liu Yan, even if I know you want to win, but there is no need to go to this extent, it's not like you can't accept disciples, not to pull a human immortal to fill the number, right?" Guo Shijie laughed coldly, "I believe you won't be this stupid, so it seems that this kid is pretending to be here."
<br><br>"In that case, let me help you handle this matter and put this kid to death!"
<br><br>After saying that, Guo Shijie sneered and was about to make his move.
<br><br>Not being able to see the cultivation, who else could it be but Yi Feng.
<br><br>At this moment, he was ironically blue, also did not expect to be targeted just after teleporting here.
<br><br>In the heart is secretly cursing.
<br><br>What's wrong with human immortals?
<br><br>The human immortal ate your rice?
<br><br>However, Guo Shijie does not care what expression Yi Feng is, a palm flip, a sharp claw mark towards Yi Feng approaching.
<br><br>PS: Two lines of work, the island as a base, the development of a branch line, while the protagonist to start to stand up.
