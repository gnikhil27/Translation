Almost instantly, the crowd woke up.
<br><br>Ye Bei and others did not say falsehoods, this one seemingly ordinary youth in front of him is really a terrifying and supreme expert.
<br><br>Otherwise.
<br><br>How could the three great demon immortals of the Western Demon Forest who had already become immortals become his prisoners?
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>"It's this circle."
<br><br>"What I told you before, take a look for yourselves first!"
<br><br>After tethering the four beasts, Yi Feng instructed towards Ye Bei and the others.
<br><br>"Okay sir you go ahead, I'll take them to have a look first." Ye Bei several people said respectfully.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, anyway, he has already contracted to Ye Bei three people, what should be done before also clearly explained to them, so there is no need to stay here himself.
<br><br>After all, he had just returned from the mountains, and he was really a little tired. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Congratulations, sir."
<br><br>All the people present, without exception, sent Yi Feng away respectfully.
<br><br>And after Yi Feng left, that group of sect's patriarch elders immediately swarmed towards also Ye Bei three people surrounded.
<br><br>"Hey hey, young warrior Ye."
<br><br>"Shake old brother."
<br><br>"Old Brother Guan."
<br><br>"Ahem, just now it was us people who were a bit impulsive, I hope don't take it to heart."
<br><br>One by one, they catered to smiling faces and passed out their voices towards Ye Bei's three people.
<br><br>Hearing this, Ye Bei three nostrils to the sky.
<br><br>A face of contempt.
<br><br>The mouth is more Yin Yang said: "not impulsive, what impulsive, come and go are your freedom, so just now you want to go, go go go, we do not stop."
<br><br>"Aiya, young warrior Ye you say this is where the words, we just now this is not an eye without a pearl."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, just now it was all our impetuosity, impetuosity."
<br><br>"Yes, it's all our fault, I hope you three don't take it to heart!"
<br><br>"The three of you have a heart higher than the sky, surely you won't be ordinary with us people."
<br><br>"By the way three, this is some of the pint medicine practiced by our Tianhua Sect pill refiners, please smile."
<br><br>"This is a bit of spiritual medicine that I have wanted to take out and give to the three of you for a long time, please take it."
<br><br>"Old Brother Guan, that time we were in the Cloud Sky Secret Realm fifty years ago, we made a friendship behind us, do you still remember?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, old brother shaking the sky our relationship is also extraordinary, back then your childhood friend, is my uncle's nephew's family's aunt's daughter, to say the least, we are still somewhat distant relatives."
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The heads and elders of the major sects, one after another, passed out various flattering voices towards Ye Bei's three.
<br><br>Some patted rainbow farts.
<br><br>Some generously took out their treasured goodies.
<br><br>Others climbed up relatives who could not even get together with the eight poles.
<br><br>Obviously, these old guys are very smart and understand what it means to be in front of an expert who can imprison a demon immortal.
<br><br>It can be said that this kind of person nail leak out of the smallest benefit, are able to let them use for life.
<br><br>So let alone let them move bricks, even if they stay here to carry dung they are willing.
<br><br>"You old things, really shameless."
<br><br>Ye Bei three people's faces darkened and glared at these people without good grace.
<br><br>The crowd smiled cheekily.
<br><br>Completely a look that could not even be shooed away.
<br><br>"All right, all right, all stay for me, but the rules I told you before, I hope you all remember in your hearts, whoever offends the gentleman, do not blame us to turn the other cheek." Shake the sky Que said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Don't worry, will do it."
<br><br>The people patted their chests and answered.
<br><br>Just this time, the first batch of workers for the establishment of Yi Feng's sect had been finalized and settled down.
<br><br>Martial Hall.
<br><br>Zhu Yun and Lu Qingshan, who hadn't been seen for a long time, came.
<br><br>"Old man, you guys are still as polite as ever."
<br><br>Yi Feng took the things Lu Qingshan brought over with both hands and said with a smile.
<br><br>"I should should."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan and the two of them were equally smiling.
<br><br>"Sit down."
<br><br>"There happens to be something I want to ask you guys."
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan politely sat down and waited for Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Well, it's like this, I plan to get a clan for fun, but there are quite a few matters to think about, also think I can only ask you guys, also hope you guys help me solve the problem." Yi Feng touched his nose and said.
<br><br>"Mr. to get a clan?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan two people immediately exclaimed, stood up shocked.
<br><br>This news was too powerful for them.
<br><br>"Don't be surprised don't be surprised."
<br><br>Seeing Lu Qingshan's appearance, Yi Feng hurriedly looked embarrassed and pressed his palm, explaining, "As you know, I'm just a mortal, so I'm just getting it for fun, nothing else in mind, thinking that you should know more than me, so I want to ask you, besides sect construction, what other processes are there?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan two people looked at each other and took a deep breath.
<br><br>This one really played colorful, actually want to get the sect again.
<br><br>If Yi Feng had not repeatedly reminded himself as a mortal, they would have thought that this one was not going to press cultivation to be high-profile.
<br><br>But mortal identity to get the sect, this operation is really testy!
<br><br>At the same time can not help but feel that their details seem to be Mr. long ago is as well known, is also well aware of their identity, this thing will ask them.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>They told all the conditions of starting the sect, one by one.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head and leaned back on the recliner and pondered.
<br><br>Because among the requirements Lu Qingshan and Zhu Yun said, there were two that were more troublesome for him.
<br><br>The first point.
<br><br>It was the sect's address.
<br><br>The rule is to choose a masterless place, if you create a sect under the jurisdiction of his clan, this is undoubtedly a challenge to that clan's sovereignty.
<br><br>And he remembered, he was in the Pingjiang City is the Castle Peak Sect's territory ah!
<br><br>He had heard many people say that the Castle Peak Sect had a patriarch and an old ancestor.
<br><br>The patriarch had a violent personality and was unblinking in his killings.
<br><br>The old man is even more eccentric, temperamental, and seems to be very good loli, many young girls have met with poisonous hands.
<br><br>Anyway, both of them seem to be no good.
<br><br>If you think about it, it's not feasible to build a sect in Pingjiang City, or you'll get into trouble with these two, and that's a big problem!
<br><br>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but glance at Lu Qingshan and Zhu Yun.
<br><br>Fortunately.
<br><br>He asked these two people.
<br><br>But for some reason, for Yi Feng's gaze, at this moment Zhu Yun and the old man of Qingshan, inexplicably pass a fever in the heart!
<br><br>But the second trouble, is what gives Yi Feng the most headache.
<br><br>That is the qualification to build a sect.
<br><br>Sect, not at random can be established, must get the qualification to build a sect permit.
<br><br>And to get this qualification, is to get the certification of the sect alliance, the sect alliance is a body formed by many sects in Eastern Victory, if not certified to build a sect, will not be recognized, while the alliance body will be ordered to dissolve.
<br><br>And there is a necessary condition to get the qualification of permission to build a sect.
<br><br>This condition is the first patriarch, must have cultivation.
<br><br>This is fucking difficult for Yi Feng, where did he get the cultivation ah?
<br><br>You know, he established the original purpose of the sect, but is not to be able to fully system tasks, and can cultivate?
<br><br>If he has the cultivation, what the hell to establish a sect ah!
<br><br>The good thing is that there is another compromise, that is, there is a past history of joining a certain sect, which is a one-sided representation that you are a person with cultivation.
<br><br>But this is also very difficult for Yi Feng.
<br><br>The system can not detect his qualifications, which sect will want him?
<br><br>Headache.
<br><br>But in order to be able to cultivate, also can not give up ah.
<br><br>I heard that there are quite a lot of small sects in Dongsheng, it seems to take time to try their luck!
<br><br>If any blind sect accepts him, he can even run in for a month and come out again, get a disciple status, is also considered to have the qualification to build a sect ah!
