I have to say.
<br><br>The immortal world can really make people grow eyes.
<br><br>Because at this moment presented in front of Yi Feng, is a black sea.
<br><br>Walk over, looking at the black as ink seawater, a glance, boundless, vastness.
<br><br>Live fucking like reaching for the darkness of the night.
<br><br>This sea, can not go out ah.
<br><br>But let's try.
<br><br>After all, he has the bottom card, which is why he looked for the sea.
<br><br>That is the amphibious slowly.
<br><br>Looking at the black seawater in front of him, Yi Feng was a little apprehensive. He released slowly from the storage ring.
<br><br>"Here, slowly, take a sip of water to see if it's poisonous." Yi Feng said, scooped up a scoop of water and put it in front of slowly's mouth. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Slowly turned his head, the two big tentacles on the top of his head eyes droop down a little, looking at Yi Feng.
<br><br>No expression.
<br><br>"Come, take a sip, try to see if there is poison." Yi Feng once again will be filled with black water scoop to slowly the most front, "just a sip."
<br><br>The tentacle stretched up and seemed too lazy to look at Yi Feng again.
<br><br>Head extremely slowly a low, a scoop of water into the mouth.
<br><br>Still expressionless.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at it for a while before he breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"It looks like there is no poison."
<br><br>"No poison is good, I was afraid of poison, when the time to go down to the sea to poison you."
<br><br>Will slowly take back the storage ring, Yi Feng began to set up camp on the beach.
<br><br>Determine slowly is able to travel in this black sea.
<br><br>But exactly how long to travel, he really does not know.
<br><br>After all, the snail is wriggling.
<br><br>So the first thing - to prepare adequate food.
<br><br>How big is this sea he did not know. But before coming to the immortal world he probably knew that the immortal world can be tens of thousands of times wider than the immortal river continent.
<br><br>What if it takes too long to travel on the sea.
<br><br>Not enough food, starving to death at sea would be too poor.
<br><br>At least, three years of food should be prepared.
<br><br>Since the water is not poisonous, the fish in the water must also not be poisonous.
<br><br>Yi Feng made a good harpoon, righteousness in the shallows down to the sea.
<br><br>Wandered around for a while, but could not see a fish.
<br><br>This sea is too dark.
<br><br>"Ouch my grass!"
<br><br>Just after going into the sea, the stomach of the foot is a prick. Like being bitten by some small insect.
<br><br>Yi Feng will be quick-eyed hands a grab.
<br><br>Fished up a ...... extremely extremely ugly looking fish.
<br><br>That fish is black, in the black sea, simply invisible.
<br><br>This fish is full of sharp teeth, eyes bubbling with green light. At this time, staring at Yi Feng, mouth spaced out and biting hard.
<br><br>The upper and lower rows of sharp teeth flying collision, issued a "click click click" sound, very much want to swallow Yi Feng look.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked across the air at their own crazy bite of the ugly fish, hand a drop, the fish fell on the water.
<br><br>Fish eyes a bulge, the stomach turned over, and died in the Yi Feng this fall.
<br><br>Floating on the surface of the water.
<br><br>Yi Feng picked it up and threw it into the fish basket.
<br><br>"Ouch crap!"
<br><br>Another sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng hand fished, another one.
<br><br>"Crouch crouch ......" leg belly before and after up and down dense, all small insect bites of tingling sensation.
<br><br>Yi Feng also do not grab.
<br><br>Simply lift a foot.
<br><br>A pair of white and clean legs, bitten full of dense fish.
<br><br>All dead bite on Yi Feng's legs.
<br><br>"On this bite, also dare to bite your grandfather me?" Yi Feng picked up the basket and put it under his feet.
<br><br>A shake of the foot, half a basket is full.
<br><br>And lifted the other leg and shook again.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked towards the shore while changing baskets and shaking his legs.
<br><br>To the shore, has been filled with a full dozen basket of fish.
<br><br>He dumped all the fish on the beach to dry, and sat on the shore to stretch his legs to catch fish.
<br><br>For the next long time, Yi Feng was fishing in the morning and handling fish in the afternoon. Pickled into fish sauce cans, sip into fish sausage, or cut into small dried fish.
<br><br>Another morning.
<br><br>Jiang to see the sea of darkness from afar.
<br><br>I did not expect to walk haphazardly, but actually arrived at the Sea of Darkness.
<br><br>Jiang to had wanted to leave, but the afterglow seemed to glance at a figure in the sea.
<br><br>In this Dark Shadow Island, it is surprising that a living person can still be seen.
<br><br>Jiang to did not hold back and headed for the Dark Sea.
<br><br>Extremely close, saw a figure suddenly sprang out of the sea!
<br><br>Jiang to startled, she looked at the person seriously.
<br><br>But that person was dressed really strange, like a wild man in general, the body is full of black tassels.
<br><br>Black tassels hanging all over the body.
<br><br>Just see that person walk to the beach, and then a jump.
<br><br>The whole body of black tassels suddenly fell on the beach!
<br><br>Only left ...... naked, not a trace of g body ......
<br><br>Jiang to the big shock, hurriedly turned his head to avoid the gaze!
<br><br>For a while, red ears resumed looking.
<br><br>She really could not help but be curious.
<br><br>Only to see that the person has turned around, bare snow-white ...... butt in the midst of a black extremely conspicuous ......
<br><br>"Poof!" He swaggered to the beach and jumped in.
<br><br>When he got up again, it was all black "fringe" again ......
<br><br>Only then did Jiang to find that those are not at all what clothing tassel decoration, but a fish!
<br><br>This this this this ......
<br><br>Jiang to stunned in place, for a time do not know what to say.
<br><br>This man used himself to fish?
<br><br>Jiang to can't help but go forward and watch the man get up from the sea once again, this is to see the man's appearance.
<br><br>This is ...... the man from before!
<br><br>"It's you!" She exclaimed out in shock.
<br><br>This district human immortal actually did not die!
<br><br>Yi Feng heard the voice, looked up and found the woman in red.
<br><br>Scared a shiver clenched the buttocks balls, fished up next to the wolf skin to the body a cloak.
<br><br>"It's you." Yi Feng coughed twice, pretending that he was not embarrassed by the light.
<br><br>"Little girl, you are not waiting to die, this does not look like waiting to die at all ah."
<br><br>The woman in red also coughed twice and came over, her face still cold. If not for the red ears, no emotion at all could be seen.
<br><br>"Who is the little girl." The woman in red said in a cold voice, "In terms of age, your ancestor might even have to call me an ancestor."
<br><br>"Exaggerated." Yi Feng kicked away a black fish that was still biting wildly on his toes, "Did you also come to the beach to fish for survival?"
<br><br>Jiang to do not deny, just look at the bouncing a ground of black fish, fell into silence ......
<br><br>It is said that the Shadow Island is located in the Sea of Darkness. In the sea, there are terrifying sharp-toothed shadow-eating fish.
<br><br>The shadow-eating fish with a black body, can eat people, teeth with poison.
<br><br>This fish melted in the black sea is difficult to detect. Once bitten, it will die of poison.
<br><br>Jiang to look at the fish bouncing on the ground, the more you look at it, the more you feel like the legendary description of the look.
<br><br>"You also like to eat fish ah?" Next to Yi Feng saw Jiang to stare unblinkingly, enthusiastically explained, "This fish can be silly, it is easy to catch."
<br><br>"It's easy, put your hand in the sea and a group of sand carving fish will come to bite you." Yi Feng said, put his hand into the sea, "Look, just like this."
<br><br>As soon as he lifted his hand, his arm was covered with fish.
<br><br>"Easy does it." He said, inviting, "Want to join us?"
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng enthusiastically went to pull Jiang Zhi, "Come on, try it, it's fun."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi pushed Yi Feng's hand away.
<br><br>"No need." She said, looking at the pile of fish on the beach that were either dead or bouncing.
<br><br>This Shadow Island had an entry but no exit, although she knew such a place, but a lot of it was known from the Immortal World bamboo slips or heard from others.
<br><br>Devouring shadow fish, also only heard people mentioned.
<br><br>Although never seen, but Jiang to this moment to be sure that the group of fish on the beach is certainly not, otherwise Yi Feng was bitten and how can be safe?
<br><br>At this time, a bouncing black fish on the beach suddenly jumped up to bite Jiang to.
<br><br>Jiang to lift his foot, calmly kicked the fish out.
<br><br>"Really stupid fish." Jiang to muttered, "bite you even if, how dare to bite me."
<br><br>"What did you say?"
<br><br>Jiang to the voice is too small, Yi Feng did not hear clearly, opened his mouth to ask.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi shook, "Nothing."
<br><br>"By the way, I have found a way out, do you want to come out with me?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>He suddenly thought of himself preparing things to be with slowly drifting across the sea.
<br><br>If the driving time is too long, all day long only have their own person, afraid that will not be bored into a neurotic.
<br><br>It is good to have someone to talk to.
<br><br>Jiang to look at Yi Feng, a raised eyebrow, "You said, you found a way to get out?"
<br><br>"Yes." Yi Feng nodded back, not hesitating at all.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's confident look, Jiang Zhi couldn't help but also look at him seriously.
<br><br>"What's the solution?"
<br><br>"Drift across the sea." Yi Feng pointed to the black sea, "from here to travel out, no matter how far, there will be an end."
<br><br>"At that time, we will be able to get out."
<br><br>The woman in red looked in the direction of Yi Feng's finger, and the vast black sea annihilated everything.
<br><br>She froze in reality, then gave a helpless laugh.
<br><br>Feeling funny for asking the man in front of her squarely.
<br><br>"This side of the world, countless people have entered and none have gone out." She said, her gaze looking at the far side of the Sea of Darkness.
<br><br>Indeed, the Sea of Darkness wasn't boundless.
<br><br>It was just that at the end of it was the huge confinement formation.
<br><br>It was absolutely impossible to get out of the Dark Sea.
