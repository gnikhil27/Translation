"How can this work, you had a hard time getting an elixir, how can you give it to me?"
<br><br>"And you yourself are just a martial artist, this elixir is even more important to you."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly refused Cloud Dancing.
<br><br>This little girl strength itself weak batch, but is only a third level martial artist cultivation, really fight even he, a mortal is not a rival.
<br><br>However, she gave him this only elixir.
<br><br>This rather moved Yi Feng's heart and at the same time, he was also a bit teary-eyed.
<br><br>"Aiya, Brother Yi Feng what are you polite to me for!"
<br><br>Xiao Mai pouted and said forcefully, "For me, cultivation is not important at all, the key is to be happy."
<br><br>This girl's naive appearance is really let Yi Feng speechless.
<br><br>No wonder this girl usually wandering around, but also do not see cultivation, the original is not want to cultivate.
<br><br>Yi Feng had to accept the elixir. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"You quickly eat."
<br><br>Xiaodai twinkled her big eyes and said.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Since he accepted it, Yi Feng didn't intend to be polite.
<br><br>After all, he also had some expectations.
<br><br>What if by taking this elixir, he was able to cultivate?
<br><br>Even if he could only cultivate a little, it would be a good start.
<br><br>At that moment.
<br><br>He swallowed it.
<br><br>"Is it delicious?"
<br><br>Xiao Mai asked with wide eyes.
<br><br>Looking at Xiaodai's expectant little gaze, Yi Feng nodded firmly and said, "Yummy."
<br><br>But secretly, his face was full of bitterness.
<br><br>This thing, simply more difficult to eat than his family's dog food.
<br><br>It was only because he couldn't bear to disappoint Xiaomai that he said this.
<br><br>"Then you quickly sit down and feel the medicinal power in the elixir, it might be greatly beneficial to you." Xiaodai said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head impatiently, then sat down cross-legged.
<br><br>He took a breath of relief and made a gesture.
<br><br>Soon, Yi Feng entered the posture of composing his mind and meditation.
<br><br>But half an hour passed.
<br><br>Yi Feng's buttocks were sitting numb, and nothing was felt.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Looks like I'm really a waste!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh, even the pills didn't have an effect on him, was truly a waste, couldn't help but lose his soul and shake his head.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an, who just came out of the room, heard Yi Feng's words and fell down unawares.
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng don't get discouraged, it's no big deal." Seeing this, Xiaodai on the side gently comforted.
<br><br>"You are living through."
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but smile.
<br><br>This heartless little girl is really endearing.
<br><br>"By the way, I plan to go home, Brother Yi Feng go back with me for a meal?" Xiaodai said softly.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Just in addition to sweeping the floor there is nothing to do, are almost faded out a bird, Yi Feng directly agreed.
<br><br>"Wu Tao brother also go together, right?"
<br><br>Xiaodai again turned her gaze to Wu Tao who was on the side.
<br><br>Wu Tao turned his nervous gaze to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Let's go together, Brother Wu Tao." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>Yi Feng's pressure-filled smile made Wu Tao not dare to refuse at all and hastily agreed.
<br><br>The three of them quickly went out of the Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>"Xiaodai, where is your home?" Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"It's in Baier City." Little Dance jumped up and down and said, obviously looking excited about being able to go home.
<br><br>"Over a hundred miles, that's quite far."
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Asking him to walk more than a hundred miles, it would be better to kill him.
<br><br>"Actually, I have a mount that can get us to Baier City very quickly, but this mount of mine, you guys can't say anything about it oh!"
<br><br>Yi Feng thought about it and planned to slowly release it.
<br><br>After all, this little dance girl is naive and cute, simply will not be harmful to people.
<br><br>As for Wu Tao, after so long contact, afraid of him are scared to death, a look is an honest person, there will not be any problems.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>"Then Yi Feng brother you quickly get it out, I want to see I want to see." Xiaodai said expectantly.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>Then with a movement of his palm, a huge snail appeared out of thin air.
<br><br>"Wow."
<br><br>"What a cute snail."
<br><br>Seeing this snail, Xiao Mai's big eyes lit up and she rushed towards slowly and carefully sized it up.
<br><br>"It's really cute oh."
<br><br>"How can you be so cute?"
<br><br>Stroking slowly's head, Xiaodai couldn't help but say.
<br><br>For Xiaodai's touch, slowly seems to be very enjoyable, head rubbed on her palm.
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng look pull, it seems to like me a lot." Xiaodai opened her eyes and said excitedly.
<br><br>"Of course it likes you, you quickly climb up."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>In the little dance climb up slowly back, Yi Feng himself climbed up, then will look at the side of Wu Tao.
<br><br>But found Wu Tao sitting on the ground, hugging a tree in trembling now.
<br><br>"Ugh."
<br><br>"Mortals are mortals, ah, I'm afraid I've never seen such a large snail."
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh, and quickly shouted, "Brother Wu Tao, don't be afraid, sit up."
<br><br>"I I I ...... I'd rather not ......"
<br><br>Wu Tao's legs and stomach were trembling.
<br><br>As soon as this snail came out, he vaguely perceived the terror of this snail, if he made a move on himself, the death crisis is afraid of one hundred thousand.
<br><br>And he also recognized, the other day let the North Sea cover the sky something, is this thing!
<br><br>"It's okay, just come up."
<br><br>Yi Feng said comfortingly.
<br><br>"Okay, okay."
<br><br>Wu Tao did not dare to refuse Yi Feng, shivering and climbed on the back of the slow.
<br><br>Slowly squirmed and rushed towards Baier City at a speed of forty to fifty yards, talking and laughing along the way.
<br><br>More than an hour later, it had arrived at the entrance of Baier City.
<br><br>"Daughter, look, it's the seniors."
<br><br>At this time, two streams of light crossed the sky, and the man in the lead emitted an excited voice.
<br><br>"It's really seniors."
<br><br>"Quick, go say hello."
<br><br>The two men hurriedly landed towards the ground, they were none other than the two father and daughter of Night Energy who were now in the limelight.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>The two collected their aura and greeted towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Wow, it's you guys, what a coincidence."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, also did not expect to run into the father and daughter two here.
<br><br>"I wonder where sir is going?" Night Energy asked respectfully.
<br><br>"I'm going to a friend's house for a casual dinner."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed and then introduced Wu Chang'an as well as Xiaodai to them.
<br><br>"Meet Miss Xiaodai, meet Mr. Wu." Seeing that it was Yi Feng's friend, the two of them, Night Energy, hurriedly greeted politely.
<br><br>And feeling Wu Chang'an's imperceptible aura, the two Night Energy could not help but feel that really the ones who followed Mr. were not ordinary people.
<br><br>"Ya, what a beautiful sister." At this time, Xiaodai saw night Yi, immediately said cheerfully: "Sister they are going to my house for dinner, do you want to join us?"
<br><br>"Uh, this ......"
<br><br>Night Yi father and daughter both stupidly.
<br><br>However, if Yi Feng did not give the word, they did not dare to agree at all, so they looked their eyes towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Xiaodai has said so, then let's go together, there are many people and lively." Yi Feng smiled and said.
<br><br>"Good good."
<br><br>The two of them, father and daughter, Night Yi, were laughing all the time.
