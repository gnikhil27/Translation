And when Bone Ben Wei casually suppressed the four demonic beasts, ready to put them away, the sky above his head suddenly cracked and opened.
<br><br>A big blood-red hand, suddenly reached out.
<br><br>Seeing this, both the milk dose and the dog, at this moment at the same time turned grave, the body can't help but lean towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, these four demonic beasts I will take away first."
<br><br>The confident voice came from the direction of the palm of the hand, with an unquestionable color.
<br><br>Then that palm, grabbed towards the four demonic beasts that had just been suppressed by Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Robbing this scum?"
<br><br>A voice that had never been heard before came out from under the black robe.
<br><br>Black robe a wave, the dog centipede milk agent was received behind him.
<br><br>Then a white-flowered bone palm, stretched out from the black robe, slapped towards the red palm.
<br><br>"Huh." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Your Excellency is actually unwilling?"
<br><br>"There is nothing I need that I can't get, since I'm not willing, then we'll have to see if your Excellency can keep it."
<br><br>Faced with Bone Ben Wei's attack, the blood-red palm did not seem to be surprised.
<br><br>Out of his mouth, came the same confident voice.
<br><br>After the voice fell, the blood-red palm flipped, space was filled with a sea of blood-red blood, and covered towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>The two palms came into contact with each other.
<br><br>"Ka ka ka ka ......"
<br><br>The surrounding space, successively cracked and opened.
<br><br>In the center of that storm, a black color appeared, and everything turned into nothingness.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Also at the same time as the contact, a terrified voice came out from the direction of that blood-red hand.
<br><br>Almost instantly, it tried to jerk the palm back.
<br><br>"Pretending in front of this scum, is it possible to run away if you want to?"
<br><br>Under the black robe, a cold snort.
<br><br>The white bone palm stretched out again, actually was hard to tear through the space, towards the red palm chased.
<br><br>Then a gentle grip.
<br><br>The blood-red palm cracked at the speed of the naked eye, turning into a sea of red blood in the sky, and then disappeared.
<br><br>The sky.
<br><br>It soon returned to clear, as if nothing had ever appeared.
<br><br>"That's a bit of tact."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked into the distance and smiled coldly.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, what was that thing just now, is it dead?" Seeing this, the dog behind the centipede milk agent hurriedly asked.
<br><br>"Not dead."
<br><br>"Then chase not?"
<br><br>"Forget it, it does not matter, anyway, was crippled." Skull Benevolent said indifferently.
<br><br>At this moment in the blood-red space, the red space was like an ocean in a storm, raising layers of huge waves and becoming extremely unstable.
<br><br>At the same time, there were also occasional bursts of miserable screams ......
<br><br>And in this unstable state, that kneeling masked man prostrate on the ground trembling, the body is about to explode as if.
<br><br>"This Immortal River Continent, where did such a skeleton come from?"
<br><br>"Could it be from the last epoch?"
<br><br>"No, there was no such a person in the last era, where the hell did it come from!"
<br><br>After a long, long time, a painful as well as unwilling voice finally came out from the slightly stable blood-red space.
<br><br>"Lord Perdition, dare I ask what is happening?" The masked man prostrated himself on the ground and asked nervously.
<br><br>"That black-robed man, broke one of my arms!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The masked man stared and staggered, his eyes about to glare out.
<br><br>"It's just that."
<br><br>"And there's no need to panic."
<br><br>Gradually, the voice gradually regained its smoothness.
<br><br>"After all, I have not long been awakened, my strength has recovered less than a million, and besides there are two powerful opponents to make it seem interesting."
<br><br>"However, that Eastern Victory's Witch Demon's Scourge, have you got it yet?"
<br><br>"Enlightened Lord Perdition, long ago got it."
<br><br>The masked man pulled out an exquisite box from his storage space and presented it with both hands.
<br><br>Blood-red chaos filled in and the box was grabbed into space and disappeared.
<br><br>But a moment later.
<br><br>"Ah ......"
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>In the blood-red space, there was an even more unstable sound than before.
<br><br>And that chaos, moreover, once again set off layers of appalling waves.
<br><br>......
<br><br>North Sea Continent.
<br><br>Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>Zhu makes the light to cross back and forth in the shabby green cow hall.
<br><br>At this moment, he is really anxious.
<br><br>In a few days, it will be the day of the audit of the Green Ox Sect, originally coaxed to come to two mortal number is enough.
<br><br>But damn, coincidentally, just received news that an outer disciple fell to his death in the back of the mountain.
<br><br>This makes him worried!
<br><br>"Report, Patriarch."
<br><br>Just then, a disciple hurriedly arrived.
<br><br>"What's the matter again?"
<br><br>Zhu made Guang shouted impatiently.
<br><br>"The Hengtian Sword Fast has sent supplies and letters to my Green Ox Sect." The disciple held a storage ring and shouted excitedly.
<br><br>"What the heck?"
<br><br>"Heng Tian Jian Zhai?"
<br><br>Zhu made the light open the ring and once it was opened, there were countless materials, treasures, and pills inside.
<br><br>He was immediately dumbfounded.
<br><br>He was a Qingniu clan, a ninth-rate clan, Hengtian Jianzhai would send him this?
<br><br>However, just as his head was dumbfounded, three more disciples rushed in.
<br><br>"Report, Taiyi Valley sent supplies as well as a letter."
<br><br>"Report, the Heavenly Dragon Valley has also sent supplies and letters."
<br><br>"Report, there is also Cang Hai Mountain."
<br><br>The ring opened.
<br><br>A pile full of treasures poured out and filled the pile.
<br><br>Opening the correspondence again, it was all expressing, the goodwill of their four clans to his Qingniu Clan.
<br><br>For example, the two clans more contact, the two clans together, the two clans marriage, etc., etc. ......
<br><br>The most excessive Heng Tian Jian Zhai also climbed up with their Qingniu clan relatives, said their clan has a disciple's aunt's distant relative's son's grandfather, once in his Qingniu clan as an outer disciple, this relationship is God's will, but also the two clans love thicker than blood fate, so that the two clans are already generations of friendship, relatives on relatives ......
<br><br>The two are the same.
<br><br>Reacted to even slapped himself twice, but found that he was not dreaming.
<br><br>But how can he not figure out, these four clans why suddenly will show goodwill to him a ninth-rate clan?
<br><br>Usually, not to mention relatives, people do not even look at them.
<br><br>At this moment, another disciple came with the news.
<br><br>"Report to the clan master, there is an old man outside who insists on joining my Green Ox Sect."
<br><br>PS: These two chapters filled in some pits and buried some things, soon the plot will go into the next chapter, in addition to accepting disciples to develop the clan, Yi Feng himself will really start to go out and make things happen.
