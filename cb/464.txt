However.
<br><br>The crowd just looked at him quietly, expressionless.
<br><br>There wasn't the slightest surprise at Yi Feng's identity as a cultivator.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng was a bit confused.
<br><br>Is that kind of cultivator pretending to be a mortal a lot, are not surprised anymore?
<br><br>So, he hastily asked awkwardly, "You guys, don't you guys feel surprised?"
<br><br>"Sir is joking, this is what is supposed to happen."
<br><br>The crowd said with full smiles on their faces.
<br><br>Yi Feng was stunned.
<br><br>What do you mean by deserved? The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Could it be that these people saw that they were going to establish a sect, so in their hearts they had already brainstormed him to become an immortal cultivator?
<br><br>When you think about it, it seems to be true.
<br><br>After all, according to the normal thinking, how can a mortal create a sect?
<br><br>So I'm afraid these people really brainstormed him into a cultivator early on.
<br><br>This also explains the old men and women of Pingjiang City, who are usually so enthusiastic about him, and even moved their homes directly to the island.
<br><br>Otherwise, the island alone is comfortable, good feng shui can not explain ah.
<br><br>So think about it, all smoothly.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This is exactly what Yi Feng wanted.
<br><br>He was worried that these people did not believe his words, but now it seems that there is no need to bother with words at all.
<br><br>"Ahem, since everyone knows the identity of my cultivator ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng did not move his voice and continued to say in a serious manner, "So everyone can completely introduce your relatives and friends, your descendants' family members to my Heaven and Earth Sect and worship under my name, and I promise that I will teach them to the best of my ability."
<br><br>Once Yi Feng made these words.
<br><br>The square that was originally Pingjiang instantly exploded.
<br><br>"Are you serious about this, sir?"
<br><br>"Yes, sir you are not joking, right?"
<br><br>"Sir, you personally accept disciples?"
<br><br>A pair of hot eyes instantly looked at Yi Feng, and excited voices came from each one of them.
<br><br>"Of course I am not joking, and not only am I personally accepting disciples, but also a hundred of them." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Whoosh!"
<br><br>As soon as Yi Feng's words fell.
<br><br>Many people in the square left like crazy.
<br><br>And the part that didn't leave was full of remorse, secretly hating themselves for not having a descendant and just missing a heavenly opportunity.
<br><br>This is to enter the discipline of Mr. ah!
<br><br>Such a heavenly opportunity, but the world's first time ah.
<br><br>And looking at this scene, Yi Feng's face opened up with a smile.
<br><br>It seems that this group of old men and women were successfully fooled and really thought they were a very bullish cultivator.
<br><br>But it is true, although he is an empty shell, but stepping on the flying sword plus the halo of the costume, not let people as a great master ah!
<br><br>With the help of this group of old men and women, I think a hundred disciples, it should be very easy to solve it.
<br><br>Yi Feng peacefully returned to his room and slept, waiting for the news from the old men and women.
<br><br>Half a day later.
<br><br>"You put your arrogance to me end, what big brother here does not matter hear, today to be able to come here, is your blessing."
<br><br>By the lake, an old man towards his own clan's eldest disciple seriously instructed.
<br><br>"Stay a while, you have to behave well, if you can become a senior's disciple, then your fate can change."
<br><br>On the other side, an old lady similarly lectured her granddaughter.
<br><br>"Remember, if senior is willing to keep you, no matter what they let you do, even if it's as a handyman, that's your blessing, do you hear me."
<br><br>In a moment, many old people with all kinds of heavenly pride and sect saints came this way, each with a pious look as if they were on a pilgrimage.
