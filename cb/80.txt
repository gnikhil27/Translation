Then, under the eyes of Ao Qing.
<br><br>A white crystal skeleton came out with a crunch.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Seeing this skeleton, Ao Qing took a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>Although he could not see the cultivation level on the skeleton, but the sense of crisis brought to him was extremely strong, and this skeleton did not have a trace of life, it was clearly a dead thing ah.
<br><br>But a dead thing, why would it move, why is there such a powerful deterrent?
<br><br>The dog couldn't figure it out.
<br><br>A speed swept, scampered to the feet of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What the hell is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng glared at Ao Qing without good grace, and his gaze moved towards the back.
<br><br>"Crap."
<br><br>Seeing this skeleton, Yi Feng was scared and immediately screamed, but soon slowed down, he rushed towards the good for nothing skeleton and kicked it hard. 
<br><br>"Again you this retarded thing, scared old me."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly cursed bitterly, looking at this skeleton on a revulsion, at the same time cursed the  system inside his heart.
<br><br>Because this is the most depressing thing he has seen!
<br><br>You have to admit it is a broken system, can not teach him to make money, can not teach him to cultivate ...... .
<br><br>But your fucking reward is also so pleasant, it really makes Yi Feng can not bear.
<br><br>Yes, this skeleton was given to Yi Feng when he first merged the system, but it's so special, it's really an eye-catcher.
<br><br>What does not do all day, with a ghost like floating around.
<br><br>Later, Yi Feng locked it in the utility room, and even forgot about it. Who knew that this product ran out by himself. 
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>Being kicked by Yi Feng again, the skull squatted his jaws and slowly climbed up. 
<br><br>"My God!!!"
<br><br>Yi Feng wasn't mentally prepared for it, directly send a fist flying.
<br><br>"Kacha!"
<br><br>With a clanking clanking sound, the skull head fell down and rolled under the corner, the remaining body bones fumbled on the ground for a while, which found the head, and then stumbled to put it back together by itself.
<br><br>"Stupid idiot, its backwards."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>"Aba aba ......"
<br><br>The skeleton head continued to stutter, turning his head with both hands, and it took a long time to set it right.
<br><br>"Today is really awful."
<br><br>Yi Feng is full of depression, directly grabbed the next piece of black robe threw it on the head, drinking: "Put it on yourself, don't go scaring people everywhere."
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>The skeleton stumbled and stumbled to put the black robe on, and because of its small size, a whole lot was wrapped in it.
<br><br>Subsequently, a black robe in the courtyard wandering around, who does not know what is bouncing around.
<br><br>However, at side, the eyes of Ao Qing, are about to fall down.
<br><br>Especially when Yi Feng beat the skeleton violently, but the skeleton didn't react at all, he was even more horrified.
<br><br>Tsk!
<br><br>The master is worthy of the master, really terrifying!
<br><br>"What now!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched, quite bored, got up and said, "It is rare to have such a good weather, you guys stay in the courtyard, I'll go to the door to get some sun."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng moved the stool to the steps at the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Lazily looking at the passing crowd, listening to the bustling hawkers hawking, don't have a sense of comfort.
<br><br>A shadow flickered across the building, then stood high on the roof, a cold glint in his eyes, looking at the small martial arts school not far ahead.
<br><br>He was dressed in flowing clothes, an abacus hanging behind him.
<br><br>It was Li Mo Xie.
<br><br>"Heavenly Yin Formation, eight directions, sixteen pulse gates have been set up, only half a moment away, it is the heavenly time, geographical location and human harmony!"
<br><br>The voice fell.
<br><br>He looked up to the sky.
<br><br>The pair of gloomy eyes, slowly closed.
<br><br>The wind rose in the sky, shrouded with a layer of cold aura, when the wind flowed, Li Mo Xie eyes Mou opened.
<br><br>"The hour has arrived."
<br><br>"Start!"
<br><br>With the fall of his voice, the sky, an invisible fog towards the direction of the martial arts hall shrouded, and then the entire martial arts hall covered in it.
<br><br>A mysterious aura drifted across the sky, and the entire Martial Hall was silent.
<br><br>"Humph, the great formation has been opened, unless you are immortal, you are also a plaything in my hands."
<br><br>Li Mo Xie let out a cold laugh.
<br><br>But also know, this special hour only a moment, do not dare to have the slightest delay, a swing of robes, behind the abacus swept into the mid-air.
<br><br>"Wow wow wow wow ......"
<br><br>A piercing sonic boom sounded, countless abacus silver beads off, like the high altitude emanation, and then turned into chaos and disappeared.
<br><br>"Condense!"
<br><br>As he made a complicated hand seal, the disappearing silver beads coalesced together, then turned into a thousand feet long transparent sword, falling vertically towards the martial arts hall, forcing Yi Feng lying on the recliner brow.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>In a flash, the entire Pingjiang City was filled with storm clouds and gusts of wind.
<br><br>"Even though it's only my <abbr title="Sometimes translated as Martial Sect">Martial Anscestor</abbr>'s full power strike, without cultivation, even if you are a Martial Emperor, under this sword, you can only become a dead dog!"
