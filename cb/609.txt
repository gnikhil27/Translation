The three put the top-grade immortal weapons into their storage rings and hurriedly ran out to raise money.
<br><br>The entrance of the Green Sky White Jade Building.
<br><br>A white-robed male brother fixed his gaze dead on them.
<br><br>"What's wrong young master?"
<br><br>Behind him, an old man with a deep breath walked up and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Take a look for yourself."
<br><br>The youth took out the jade pendant he was holding in his hand and handed it to the old man.
<br><br>"This is the Tian Shen jade that the master gave to the grandson during the last treasure seizure, which can automatically sense the treasures that appear nearby." The old man whispered, "Is there something wrong with the Duke?"
<br><br>"Look at it more carefully." The youth said through clenched teeth.
<br><br>At his words, the old man fixed his eyes to look, and immediately found that the power within the Tian Shen jade was stupidly moving, the kind that could not be restrained.
<br><br>"This is?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The old man stared and staggered, shocked: "Such powerful energy, this is the top immortal weapon?"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"At least it's a top-tier immortal weapon, it's on the bodies of those three brats just now." The white-robed youth's eyes flashed with an eerie light as he said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Three First Turn Xuan Immortals."
<br><br>The old man's needle-like gaze locked onto the three, and couldn't help but say, "How could there be top-tier immortal weapons on three tiny First Turn Xuan Immortals?"
<br><br>"Yeah, I'm surprised too, even I don't have a top-tier immortal weapon on my body." The white-robed youth licked his tongue and said meaningfully.
<br><br>"Then you are planning to?"
<br><br>The old man's expression was cold.
<br><br>"There is no hurry."
<br><br>The youth waved his palm, "It's not too late to follow up and take a look, after all, to be able to appear in the green sky and white jade building of the non-wealthy, but do not have any big background."
<br><br>The old man nodded his head.
<br><br>Then the two followed silently.
<br><br>The Heavenly Mansion trio arrived at the Treasure Gathering Pavilion.
<br><br>Gathering Treasure Pavilion was the largest chamber of commerce in the Immortal World, and also the largest money changer in the Immortal World, with its branches in any major city in the Immortal World.
<br><br>"How to get it, 90 million immortal stones, uh we three together is not enough to pull." Li people said.
<br><br>"Like pull, but even so we have to get together 90 million immortal stones as soon as possible, Master Bones is still waiting for us to go back to pay the bill." Li Di picked up the cavity.
<br><br>"That can how to get, called er we old man to sell the family industry."
<br><br>"We are at least the Heavenly Mansion Li family, scrap together or be able to scrape together ninety million." Li Tian said.
<br><br>With that, he took out the jade slip and began to contact the old man of the family.
<br><br>"Gather the money and buy the bill?"
<br><br>Not far away.
<br><br>The white-robed youth raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>Then with a wave of his hand, he said, "Go and check, the Heavenly Palace Li family, what role they play."
<br><br>"Check again, within the Heaven's Immortal Hall, if there are any experts with the surname Bones."
<br><br>The voice just fell.
<br><br>The old man behind him had already disappeared.
<br><br>"Old man, I lied to your grandfather."
<br><br>"The three sons within are so smart that they will fall for the trick?"
<br><br>"Anyway, I warn your old man, no money, give me the Li family sold, anyway, today does not give er we call the money, er we brother three sons with you dead old man severed relations."
<br><br>At the entrance of the Treasure Pavilion, the noise continued.
<br><br>The white youth in the distance, the more you listen to the corners of the mouth raised higher.
<br><br>Seen dude.
<br><br>Never seen for a ye spring night, to sell the family to pay for the bill.
<br><br>"How about, have you got news?"
<br><br>He tilted his head and slanted a glance at the old man who returned behind him at some point.
<br><br>"Your Honor, the Heavenly Mansion is a small country in the Immortal Realm, and the strongest of its Li family is only a Fifth Turn Xuan Xian."
<br><br>"As for the surname Bones, the entire Heaven's Immortal Hall does not have this surname, and there is no one in the Immortal Realm's expert record who has this surname."
<br><br>The old man said one by one.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>The youth's face was filled with leap of joy, a touch of hostility flashed from his eyes.
<br><br>"Well, well, well, within the hurry to call the money over well."
<br><br>"Uh we stay honestly in the sun and moon peak well, give uh we Li family find a back mountain well."
<br><br>Some arguments, the three brothers plus their own belongings, as well as the Li family to give a part of the immortal stones, is finally put together 90 million immortal stones.
<br><br>They entered the Treasure Pavilion money bank and exchanged the 90 million immortal stones for nine 10 million immortal tickets, left the Treasure Pavilion with an excited face and rushed back towards the Green Sky White Jade Building.
<br><br>Just at this moment, the oldest Li Tian footsteps a beat.
<br><br>"Older two and older three, uh guys are being watched."
<br><br>Li Tian said alertly.
<br><br>When he said this, Older Two Older Three also sensed it.
<br><br>At this moment, the three of them.
<br><br>It was like being in a huge cage.
<br><br>Everything around them seemed to be blocked off.
<br><br>This feeling gave the three people the creeps.
<br><br>"I really didn't expect, you three trash are still quite alert!"
<br><br>Just as the three were on guard, two figures, an old man and a young man, suddenly appeared in front of the three.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>The three people asked vigilantly.
<br><br>"Do not care who I am, this is not important, the important thing is, hand over the top immortal weapons in your storage rings!" The youth directly extended his palm, and his tone carried no doubt.
<br><br>The three people looked flustered.
<br><br>"Uh guys where do you get the top level immortal weapon, within the wrong." Li Tian said.
<br><br>The youth's expression was cold.
<br><br>"It seems that you guys are toasting the wine and not eating the punishment?"
<br><br>"You three trash, what gives you the right to have top-tier immortal weapons?"
<br><br>"One last word to you all, take out the top-tier immortal weapons in your storage rings."
<br><br>The icy words fell, the aura on the youth's body poured out, pressing the three Li Tians breathless.
<br><br>This feeling.
<br><br>It was like a big mountain straddling in front of them, making people feel unfathomable.
<br><br>"Uh, uh guys really no ......"
<br><br>Li Tian covered his storage ring and said through clenched teeth.
<br><br>"No?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth looked cold, and in the next instant, he had actually arrived in front of Li people.
<br><br>A fist.
<br><br>It landed abruptly on the small of Li Ren's abdomen.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Li Ren hissed out, stimulated by the intense pain, and struggled violently on the ground, holding his stomach.
<br><br>And his Xuan Xian aura collapsed like a balloon at this moment.
<br><br>"Lao-san!"
<br><br>"The Dantian within Lao San!"
<br><br>Li Tian and Li Di's faces changed drastically, and their foreheads even broke out in cold sweat as they turned their hateful gazes towards the white-robed youth and hissed, "You actually nullified my third brother?"
<br><br>"So what if I did?"
<br><br>"Who told you to deceive me just now?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth blew his fist lightly, with that look, as if what he had just invalidated was a dead dog, "This is what happens when you cheat me."
<br><br>"You ...... are so vicious."
<br><br>Li Tian gritted his teeth, stared at the white-robed youth with a deadly stare, and said word for word, "I said, we don't have top-tier immortal weapons, why are you forcing yourself on people!"
<br><br>"No?"
<br><br>The white-run youth narrowed his smile, revealing a touch of bloodthirsty color, and waved his palm.
<br><br>With a tearing sound, Li Di, who was next to Li Tian, had one palm instantly torn off by him hard.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The decisive pain caused Li Di to scream hysterically in pain, and the wound at his flush shoulder was even more shocking to the eyes.
<br><br>But before he could stand still, the white-robed youth's attack was actually coming towards Li Di once again.
<br><br>Snort!
<br><br>Almost instantly, the white-robed youth's punch went straight through Li Di's chest.
<br><br>"Brother, uh, uh it hurts, uh, uh dying?"
<br><br>Li Di left tears in his eyes.
<br><br>Looking at the shocking penetrating wound on his chest, he stood in place trembling and helpless.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>Then he fell straight to the ground.
<br><br>2.
