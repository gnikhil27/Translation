Yi Feng carried skeleton Ben Wei in the twinkling of an eye and returned to his home martial arts school.
<br><br>As soon as he got home, he slammed Bone Ben Wei into the small dark room and shut the door dead.
<br><br>"You just stay inside, dishonest thing!" He scolded.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at a few shivering things next to him, a dog shivering on the ground, a centipede shivering on the dog's back, a shivering bear cowering behind the dog.
<br><br>-- and a skeleton who didn't know when to mix with the skeleton, afraid to enter the martial arts school, shivering in front of the martial arts school -- the ghost ......
<br><br>He gave a few things a white glance, "You few also give me honestly, or one by one to be beaten."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng waved up his sandbag big fist, a little thumb, "I can get you all with one finger now."
<br><br>Four things eyes frightened even back.
<br><br>Yi Feng satisfied with striding out of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Outside the sun is just right, Yi Feng squinted his eyes with satisfaction.
<br><br>The weather is really nice, it's a good day to practice. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Ever since he obtained a full level of cultivation, he has been itching to get his hands dirty.
<br><br>Only that impromptu few hundred punches, not at all addictive.
<br><br>He was, now, going to find someone to practice with.
<br><br>But the cultivator ...... Yi Feng's face showed a difficult look.
<br><br>Since he came to this world, because he could not cultivate the reason, so never how to really contact the cultivator.
<br><br>So many years, he can a cultivator do not know. Where to find a cultivator to practice?
<br><br>Across the road, chopping pork Pork Rong from Yi Feng out of the martial arts school attention on him. At this moment can't help but open up and ask loudly: "Mr. Yi, what's wrong? Does not look too happy look."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Pork Rong, a thought appeared in his head.
<br><br>He hurriedly walked over, "Pork Rong, I was about to ask you something."
<br><br>He didn't know a cultivator, it was always possible that the people he knew knew a cultivator.
<br><br>"Sir you say." When Pork Rong heard this, he hurriedly put down the work in his hand and asked seriously.
<br><br>"Do you have any cultivators in your family or people you know?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>Pork Rong was puzzled, "Sir what do you want to find a cultivator for?"
<br><br>"To practice." Yi Feng rubbed the palm of his hand.
<br><br>Pork Rong's heart jumped, and the knife in his hand was scared off.
<br><br>"This this this ......"
<br><br>"Don't panic." Seeing this appearance of Porky Rong, Yi Feng said chestily, "Don't worry about me, nothing will happen."
<br><br>Yi Feng understood that, for them, he was just a mortal like them.
<br><br>Looking for a cultivator to practice is looking for death.
<br><br>Pork Rong looked at Yi Feng confused ...... himself would worry about him?
<br><br>Pork Rong hurriedly picked up the knife in his hand and hurriedly continued to chop meat, "No no no."
<br><br>"Sir know, I'm just a handless trash, how to know the cultivator that sir want to find."
<br><br>"Hey, I knew it." Yi Feng sighed, the afterimage saw the store boy who was busy serving noodles next to him again, and walked over.
<br><br>"Xiao Er ah, do you know any cultivators?" Yi Feng walked over and asked.
<br><br>"Ah? Cultivator? What does sir want to find cultivators for?" The shopkeeper stopped and asked.
<br><br>"Practice."
<br><br>The shopkeeper was so scared that he almost didn't have a steady hand to spill the face.
<br><br>Mental sarcasm, you still need to practice? That is not a minute to die ......
<br><br>But did not dare to brush the face of Yi Feng, he still steady voice, swallowed saliva.
<br><br>"What kind of cultivator do you want to practice?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the shopkeeper's thin appearance, "Anyway, certainly not a mortal like you. It has to be powerful."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng lifted his fist and blew, "You can't stand my fist like this."
<br><br>"Sir wise." The shopkeeper bent at the waist, "Sir said cultivators, I do not know any of them."
<br><br>Yi Feng was about to leave.
<br><br>Suddenly saw the old king's head sitting under a tree in the courtyard next to him looking at himself is taking a cool ride.
<br><br>"Old Wang Tau ah ......" he walked over.
<br><br>"Sir no need to ask, you said the cultivator, I also do not know any of them." He hurriedly stood up and added: "I've never even seen one in my life."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the old king's head who couldn't even stand up.
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed, shook his head helplessly and said, "Hey, you guys are too weak."
<br><br>Said, leaving with his hands behind his back, "It's not too cold in high places. ......"
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, a group of people gathered together, "What's wrong with sir, suddenly you have to find someone to practice."
<br><br>"Doktor?"
<br><br>"Maybe it's like what Mr. said, it's too lonely in high places."
<br><br>"But now it seems that Mr. is not pretending to be a mortal, so are we still pretending to be mortal?" Pork Rong carried the kitchen knife and spoke hesitantly.
<br><br>"Tired fart, still need you to pretend? Didn't you hear what the gentleman just said about him?" Old Wang Tau pointed to the shopkeeper next to him, "Mortal mortal, we are all mortal!"
<br><br>"Yes, in the eyes of the gentleman, we are mortals, there is nothing to pretend." The shopkeeper nodded in agreement.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, you guys are right." Pork Rong nodded his head like a garlic.
<br><br>Yi Feng went around Pingjiang City and couldn't find a single cultivator. One did not even know a cultivator.
<br><br>What a trash ah ......
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng was distressed, he suddenly thought of something.
<br><br>Stood in place.
<br><br>Right, at that time when the system rewarded himself Bone Ben Wei, didn't it say that Bone Ben Wei was the number one expert?
<br><br>Although I do not know what range of the first expert, but how to say also has the name of the first high, should be a little something right?!
<br><br>Although never seen him use it.
<br><br>Go and try?
<br><br>Thinking, Yi Feng turned around and went back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>The martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng just left the front foot, was locked tight small wooden door edge seam sticks out a white bone.
<br><br>A finger picked into the lock, a pounding.
<br><br>The door lock opened with a sound.
<br><br>The next moment, a skeleton stretched out of the pitch-black hole and turned its head to look around.
<br><br>"The master is gone, right?"
<br><br>"Gone gone gone!" The dog hurriedly pushed open the small door for Skeleton Ben Wei, "Congratulations big brother congratulations big brother! Freedom again!"
<br><br>"Don't even look at who I am." Bone Ben Wei said with satisfaction.
<br><br>The dismantled limbs were put together in a flash, "Go, hurry up! While the master has not yet returned!"
