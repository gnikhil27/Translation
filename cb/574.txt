Hiss!
<br><br>The man couldn't help but draw a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>When he was first locked in, he was also extremely resentful.
<br><br>So more than once he tried to find a way to escape.
<br><br>So he knew exactly how powerful the forbidden on this island was.
<br><br>He even suspected that this Shadow Island was not in the Immortal World anymore, but a small world attached to the Immortal World.
<br><br>Equivalent to say, to leave here, you need to break the boundary.
<br><br>If it is the kind of low-level realm, breaking the boundary may be easy, but to be able to break the boundary of the immortal world ......
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>The man looked up at Yi Feng again and took a deep breath.
<br><br>That is to say, the strength of this one in front of him, is the kind of immortal realm ceiling. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Because the only ones who could possibly break the immortal realm with their hands were the ones with the immortal realm ceiling.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This is all still just his guess.
<br><br>He needed further confirmation.
<br><br>"Then may I ask if the house next to this, as well as the vegetation, is also yours ......"
<br><br>The man solemnly inquired, and although he hadn't confirmed it yet, his address to Yi Feng had begun to gradually change.
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>To be honest, he was quite satisfied with this current courtyard, himself, not much different from making a place with birds and flowers in the desert.
<br><br>"My place is not bad, right?" Yi Feng asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The man's body trembled.
<br><br>This was not okay, for him, an old man who had been lingering on Shadow Island for countless years, what was happening in front of him was simply a miracle.
<br><br>"Is it convenient to ask senior, how did this all come out?" He asked.
<br><br>"What's convenient or not, it's all just made by hand." Yi Feng explained with a smile. Although the seed saplings were produced by the system, it really didn't take much effort for him to plant them.
<br><br>This light sentence made the corners of the man's mouth twitch.
<br><br>He really did not know how to respond.
<br><br>This kind of miraculous handwriting, but said that it was casually made ...... simply does not look like the words of a person.
<br><br>But look at Yi Feng that breezy, insignificant look, he understood, I'm afraid that the truth is really true.
<br><br>His eyes like a miracle things, in the hands of this one, I'm afraid it's really handy.
<br><br>But even through the conversation again proved that Yi Feng may really powerful to unimaginable, but he still not quite credible.
<br><br>How did he get so lucky that he came across a ceiling of the immortal world?
<br><br>In this.
<br><br>Could there be some kind of misunderstanding?
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Everything was what Yi Feng said, he didn't witness it with his own eyes ah.
<br><br>"Oops."
<br><br>Just as he was pondering, Yi Feng next to him suddenly gave a startled cry.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>He raised his head and asked blankly.
<br><br>"These damn vultures, I was worried that I couldn't find them anywhere, but I didn't expect to fly in front of my house."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng turned his head and walked into the martial arts school.
<br><br>And the man who reacted was also busy inclining his head to look his eyes towards the outside.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Not far away on the dead tree, a few vultures appeared.
<br><br>Scarlet eyes.
<br><br>Gave an invisible layer of the shadow of death.
<br><br>He licked his tongue.
<br><br>The eyes flashed with a strong color of scruples, and even have posed for a good stance, after all, he did not lose a lot in this group of vultures.
<br><br>And the group of vultures also seems to have found him.
<br><br>The man's face changed.
<br><br>The man's face changed greatly.
<br><br>A sense of crisis rose in his heart.
<br><br>However, at that moment, a sharp arrow pierced through space and flew straight out, forcing its way towards the group of vultures.
<br><br>Then, an arrow three.
<br><br>It was like a sugar gourd on a string and fell down.
<br><br>And the remaining few saw the situation ready to flee, but also by the subsequent flight out of several arrows hit one after another ......
<br><br>Almost instantly.
<br><br>There was not a single vulture left in the group ......
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>The man's eyes widened and a dry duck-like scream came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Vultures.
<br><br>This group of vultures, so unbeatable?
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>This group of vulture strength itself is not high, if it is taken to the outside world, with his strength can also kill a large group.
<br><br>But you have to look at where this is ah.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Directly let the man's heart to Yi Feng's last trace of doubt also completely dispelled, directly bowed down the body.
<br><br>"My name is Gong Chen, I have met senior."
<br><br>A respectful voice came from him.
<br><br>Completely convinced by the strength of the young man in front of him.
<br><br>Noticing the man's adoring gaze.
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously slightly angled his head.
<br><br>Look.
<br><br>Kill two birds to convince this man, how pretentious.
<br><br>This is the reason why he wants to use this place as a backyard.
<br><br>Because in this place, no matter what strength you are, as long as there is no kind of wilderness survival skills, are just a brother.
<br><br>But this group of elm cultivators, only know cultivation, where know what survival skills.
<br><br>Without cultivation, nothing.
<br><br>"Go and pick them up!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>"Senior, why pick them back up?" Gong Chen couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Such good ingredients, why not pick them up?" Yi Feng asked rhetorically.
<br><br>"You are, you are going to eat it?"
<br><br>Gong Chen couldn't help asking, "Can this thing be eaten?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled without saying anything, and after Gong Chen picked the vulture back up, he took Gong Chen into the martial arts school.
<br><br>The moment he walked into the martial arts school.
<br><br>Gong Chen was stunned.
<br><br>Oh my god.
<br><br>Look, what is all this.
<br><br>Everywhere he looked, there were demon wolves hanging all over. With his knowledge of Shadow Island, I'm afraid that ninety-nine percent of the demon wolves on the whole island were hanging here.
<br><br>In addition, all kinds of vultures are also hanging everywhere, there are even, brine vulture head, brine vulture legs.
<br><br>In addition, in addition there are countless shadow killer fish?
<br><br>He swallowed deeply.
<br><br>At this moment, he could not use words to describe his shock.
<br><br>The terrifying species that made them scared and even treated them as prey, actually, actually ...... was used as an ingredient by this one?
