"This fucking secular, everyone looks like a mortal on the surface, maybe you might come across a hidden big brother."
<br><br>Wu Changan walked on the street, looking at the people coming and going, feeling that there was crisis everywhere.
<br><br>"It's better to go outside the city for a while!"
<br><br>Just as he said that, Wu Chang'an had already disappeared.
<br><br>A few moments later, he had arrived outside the city.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"It's better to be outside the city, the mountains and clear water here ......"
<br><br>However, just as his voice fell, a rumble came from the earth.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>Deafening sound spread all around, the ground even revealed a crack, then under Wu Changan's staring eyes smacking his lips, a huge building broke out of the ground, then towered in front of Wu Changan.
<br><br>"What the heck?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Holy shit!"
<br><br>"Damn, dying dying dying."
<br><br>Looking at this huge building, Wu Chang'an cursed, he obviously just want to find a safe place to meticulously ah, why will lead to this?
<br><br>And this thing, at first glance is the Jiang Yu's tomb ah!
<br><br>Wu Chang'an wanted to cry, immediately felt a myriad of breath towards this side, a time filled with a sense of crisis.
<br><br>"I've never been here before, never."
<br><br>"I vanish!"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an waved his hand seal, and a brain burrowed inside the earth and disappeared.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>Diving into the ground for an unknown number of feet, wrapped by the surrounding land, Wu Chang'an felt safer than ever, but the next moment, it felt like he had crashed through something.
<br><br>The picture in front of his eyes changed.
<br><br>And found himself in a big hall.
<br><br>And right in front of the hall, there was a Sacred Divine Armament hanging.
<br><br>"Holy shit!"
<br><br>"How did you get in here?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Changan cursed, and without even looking at the divine weapon, he began to run.
<br><br>With this run, countless organs in the hall touched off.
<br><br>"Boom boom boom boom ......"
<br><br>An attack acted on Wu Chang'an's body for a long, long time before it subsided.
<br><br>And at this moment, Yun Chang'an had already hidden inside a corner, trembling and shivering.
<br><br>"Hoo hoo hoo hoo!"
<br><br>"So close, so close, I almost lost my life."
<br><br>Wu Changan shivered and murmured, "I actually used up eighteen of my one billion substitution techniques just now, if I use up another nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-two substitution techniques, I'm going to be cold!"
<br><br>"Oh my god, someone help me!"
<br><br>"It's too dangerous."
<br><br>"Determined not to move, even if I die here in old age, I won't move."
<br><br>......
<br><br>At the foot of the Green Mountain Gate.
<br><br>"Haha, I, Yu Wujie, am really handsome and dashing, and my peach blossom luck automatically finds my door!"
<br><br>Yu Wu Jie looked at the woman in front of him like a heavenly fairy, his eyes were about to straighten, that crystal clear general skin, that long and slender jade legs, all called him to lust.
<br><br>There is also her face hanging that veil, Yu Wu Jie can not wait to tear it off, to take a good look at the back of what is a fairy.
<br><br>What's more crucial is that this kind of stunning beauty, this kind of fairy, or the most outstanding female disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, just happened to find him.
<br><br>"How about it, do you like it?" Under the woman's veil, a seductive voice came out, jade feet lifted to gently pick Yu Wujie's chin, and asked leisurely.
<br><br>And he was none other than the newly promoted genius disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Like, like."
<br><br>Yu Wujie's nosebleed was about to come out, shivering and shivering, said.
<br><br>"Then from now on, you will follow me, right?" The voice said again, but with a hint of meaningful look in his eyes.
<br><br>"Fine, fine."
<br><br>Yu Wujie hardly had the slightest resistance.
<br><br>The woman was just about to continue talking when her eyebrows twitched and she got up to look outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Miss, I guess there's movement in that tomb, let's hurry up and go?" On the side, an old man with sword brows hurriedly reminded.
<br><br>"Good, let's go there as soon as possible, yes, take him with you." Peng Xian'er departed to the extreme, glanced at Yu Wujie and reminded.
<br><br>The sword-browed old man glanced at Yu Wujie, not knowing why his own lady wanted to bring such a waste, but he didn't say much, and as soon as he pulled up Yu Wujie, he rushed towards the outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>When they arrived, in addition to the large and small forces, the Wind and Cloud Valley's Cloud Immortal Que had also arrived.
<br><br>"It seems that you all, have arrived quite quickly!"
<br><br>Just then, along with a laughing sound, a white-robed fluttering gentleman landed with an old man.
<br><br>"Blowing Snow Villa, Fifth Longkong!"
<br><br>Looking at the man who was spotless and more beautiful than a woman, Yun Xian Que and Peng Xian Er both frowned slightly.
<br><br>Clearly, this was also a ruthless character.
<br><br>"But, is it just the two of you, how come we haven't seen anyone from the Imperial Sword Sect?" Fifth Long Sky asked.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Yun Xian Que and Peng Xian Er were both silent.
<br><br>It was true that they hadn't heard of the Imperial Sword Sect for a long time recently, and even their disciples were rarely seen walking around, and they didn't even rush to such a big event, which was indeed bizarre.
<br><br>"Forget it, one less will come one less opponent, we'd better see first, how in the end this cemetery to get in!"
<br><br>Saying that, Fifth Longkong dropped his gaze on the Martial Saint's Tomb.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que and Peng Xian Er both did the same, their expressions full of salivation.
<br><br>PS: Well, the next big scene is going to be.
