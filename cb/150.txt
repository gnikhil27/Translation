"Rumble, rumble, rumble your sister!"
<br><br>"These cultivation of a very unqualified, so much noise does not disturb the people, to break through do not know to find a place where no one goes?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the distant sky that rumbles constantly movement, there is a cursing voice.
<br><br>While cursing, Yi Feng while walking towards the back of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Old man Wu and the three of them are still reclaiming the land, although the speed is not fast, but Yi Feng does not care, after all, the three of them a handful of years old, and do a package of work, the overall is considered to be organized.
<br><br>But Lu Dasheng made him slightly impressed.
<br><br>People are not reliable, but the dung is not to say!
<br><br>The next few days, everything is on track, Zhong Qing's injuries are slowly improving.
<br><br>And Yi Feng reverted to the salted fish state.
<br><br>However, the salty fish he does find time to practice some qin, chess, calligraphy and painting.
<br><br>"Qin: out of this world." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Chess: unparalleled."
<br><br>"Book: perfection."
<br><br>"Painting: comparable to God."
<br><br>Looking at his learning progress, Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Chess and book two he guessed well, should be the same as the qin, because he used to play chess and write novels, so the proficiency is accumulated.
<br><br>And painting, this is with his previous painting martial arts book this overlap, so without practice is directly with the gods, he tried to paint a pair of landscape painting, really is exquisite.
<br><br>This is to save Yi Feng a lot of time.
<br><br>If all the practice from the initial level, really do not know how long to practice. The reason why he practiced, but really did not think that what mount, as long as the damn system does not take back the martial arts school on the good.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng re-immersed in the practice.
<br><br>Ao Qing, the dog lying on the ground, was bored, really miss the time when he was doing things with Skull Brother!
<br><br>Just then, the sun-shaped mark on its forehead faintly flashed brightly, causing his gaze to light up slightly, because it was a unique transmission from his Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>After glancing at Yi Feng, who was concentrating on practicing the qin, he stood up and ran towards the outside of the martial arts hall.
<br><br>After leaving the Martial Hall, Ao Qing immediately exerted his extreme speed, so fast that he was like a shooting star, disappearing in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>So!
<br><br>Nowadays, he followed Yi Feng's side and had unknowingly reached the Demon King realm.
<br><br>After he left Pingjiang City, he quickly headed inside the mountain.
<br><br>An hour later, several figures appeared in front of him and were looking down at him from above.
<br><br>At the head of the group, was a cold-faced woman with a red sun-shaped mark on her fair forehead.
<br><br>Next to the woman, followed by several black-robed people with profound aura, if there are experts here, they will be able to find that this person is accompanied by a strong demonic aura.
<br><br>"Boiling Qingcheng, how is it you?"
<br><br>Seeing this woman, Ao Qing's face fiercely changed, while his paws subconsciously retreated a few steps.
<br><br>"Not bad, it's me."
<br><br>The woman's back was turned to Ao Qing, and an emotionless voice came out, "How about it, goodbye!"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Ao Qing revealed a painful look of hatred.
<br><br>Although this woman was beautiful, she was as poisonous as a snake.
<br><br>She was the holy daughter of his Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan, and her status was on par with his father. In the entire race, all the clan demons worshiped her as the goddess of their hearts.
<br><br>At the beginning, Ao Qing also adored her, but even as the third prince of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf tribe, he was not qualified to talk to her, and felt deeply inferior in front of her, and never dared to look at her from afar.
<br><br>But one day, she suddenly came close to him.
<br><br>When he felt that the peak of his life had come and gave her the only treasure he had in order to show his love, she pushed Ao Qing down into the abyss in public.
<br><br>In the middle of the night to sneak into the Virgin's bedchamber, plotting misconduct.
<br><br>This charge, Ao Qing in the entire tribe of demons shouting, more by his father expelled from the tribe, while setting a seal, ten years shall not be transformed.
<br><br>Expelled from the tribe after Ao Qing accidentally into the danger, seriously injured cultivation lost, if not met the master, now he is afraid that he has long died under the stick.
<br><br>This time, he thought it was his few friends in the tribe to send him a message, after all, they have special fluctuations between them, but did not think it was boiling Qingcheng.
<br><br>I guess it was Bo Qingcheng who got the transmission fluctuation between them!
<br><br>"What do you want?" Ao Qing asked in a cold voice.
<br><br>"Do you know why I cheated from you to get the Wind Chasing Key?" Bo Qingcheng said leisurely, "Because this Wind Chasing Key is the key to the secret realm of my Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ao Qing was slightly shocked, finally understanding why Bo Qingcheng had gone to all the trouble to cheat the key from him in the first place.
<br><br>"You're surprised, aren't you!"
<br><br>Bo Qingcheng's coldly voice continued.
<br><br>"When you were born, the old clan chief calculated through the clan's moon disk that you were a son of qi luck and would lead my Sky Devouring Demon Wolf to glory, so when you were born, he gave you this Wind Chasing Key and set a seal so that only you could use it."
<br><br>"But what everyone didn't expect is that this titled son of qi luck is just a bullshit, just a dude waste in the tribe, and leading the tribe to glory, it's simply a big joke!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You shut up!"
<br><br>Ao Qing's body trembled with anger, and his eyes were red.
<br><br>"What, did I say it wrong?"
<br><br>Bo Qingcheng said coldly: "You are now in exile, you can't even return to the tribe, a dog in the water but, so where is your qi!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Bo Qingcheng's words hammered straight into Ao Qing's heart.
<br><br>Expelled from the tribe, is indeed his heart has always been the pain, especially when suffering wrongful accusations, being shouted at by everyone, that feeling is really difficult to say.
<br><br>"But, I can give you a chance now."
<br><br>Suddenly, boiling Qingcheng's words turned, while her body turned around, revealing the face that matched her name, the face that was so captivating.
<br><br>"Come back to the tribe with me and use the Wind Chasing Key to open the secret realm, I can help you lift the seal to reincarnate as a human, and at the same time I will find a way to help you release the tribe's misunderstanding of you."
<br><br>"Of course at the end, there will be a most generous reward for you!"
<br><br>After saying that, her slender jade hand took out a crystal clear white pellet and said leisurely, "This is a demon king pellet, with this demon king pellet, it can help you break through the demon king realm, which with your qualification, can save you at least fifty years of hard cultivation."
<br><br>"How about that?"
<br><br>Bo Qingcheng faintly raised those seductive red lips.
