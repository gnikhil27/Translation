The eyes of the crowd instantly revealed a sizzling light.
<br><br>Almost instantly, there was a swarm of countless experts on the scene, scrambling to be the first to rush towards the stone door.
<br><br>"Get out!"
<br><br>"Get out of the way, don't block the way."
<br><br>Before even entering the door, there were already people fighting.
<br><br>The Martial Saint's Tomb.
<br><br>In front of this kind of chance, it was enough to make people turn crazy.
<br><br>"Elder, shall we wait or what?" Fifth Changkong asked.
<br><br>"No harm!" The fifth formation said, "This yin and yang formation is actually the most critical in the earth gate, because the earth gate can not open the heaven gate is also impossible to break through, so most of the formation taboos and organs are arranged in the earth gate, instead, there will not be any big crisis in the heaven gate."
<br><br>"Just let me can't figure out is that a just to martial spirit of the little guy, actually really broke into the earth door to open the door of heaven."
<br><br>The fifth formation could not help but lament. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Although it's true that I can't figure it out, but the fact is right in front of my eyes, since the Heavenly Gate is not too dangerous, then let's hurry up and go in too!" The fifth long air said.
<br><br>At these words, the fifth formation nodded and led the fifth longkong towards the heavenly gate and swept inside.
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er and Yun Xianque and the others also rushed in towards the inside without lagging behind.
<br><br>Inside the Heavenly Gate.
<br><br>The first thing that appeared in front of the crowd was a huge hall.
<br><br>Above the walls, there were many dazzling treasures hanging, and there were already many cultivators fighting over them.
<br><br>But it was just some king-quality, royal-quality things, and although they were also important, the people of the three major powers did not fight.
<br><br>Because they understand.
<br><br>Inside, there must be even more important treasures.
<br><br>Following the hall all the way in, there was a corridor that could not be seen at the end.
<br><br>At this moment in the corridor, there are already a lot of people rushing in front.
<br><br>There are still many large and small organs, although many people have died, but can not stop the people of the three major powers.
<br><br>Following the corridor all the way forward, the people all coincidentally felt a powerful aura.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This is the aura of the holy product?"
<br><br>The crowd was instantly shocked, their eyes were flooded with a strong sizzling color, and without saying a word, they rushed towards the inside.
<br><br>Although there were also many other organs on the way, but the people of the three major powers also surprisingly tacit understanding, together to join forces to crack it.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A new hall appeared in front of the crowd.
<br><br>In the front of the hall, there is a huge altar.
<br><br>On top of the altar, there were three light clusters floating.
<br><br>"Sacred Heavenly Spirit Rope!"
<br><br>This rope was already known ten thousand years ago, and it was rumored that when it was cast, not only could it bind a Saint, even a Martial Emperor would have to take a few tries to break free.
<br><br>"Saintly Wind and Cloud Pestle!"
<br><br>It was also something that had been passed down tens of thousands of years ago, and had been the native treasure of a Wolf Clan Half-Emperor, but it was not expected to arrive here.
<br><br>"Saintly Grade Divine Devil Scissors!"
<br><br>This one has an even greater origin, heard of hundreds of thousands of years ago, has gone through several owners, rumor has it that this shear has cut off the head of a Martial Emperor.
<br><br>Almost instantly, the people of the three powers recognized these three supreme treasures.
<br><br>A hot gaze emanated from their eyes.
<br><br>Of course, after the three sacred divine items, there were also piles of all kinds of goodies, from gold and silver jewels for mortals to pills and techniques used by cultivators.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>The people present all drew in a cold breath.
<br><br>I'm afraid that such a large amount of resources is the lifetime savings of that Jiang Yu Martial Saint, even for their three major powers, it is a heavy treasure that cannot be taken lightly.
<br><br>Of course, the most attractive to their attention, is the altar, there is a stone door.
<br><br>Inside the stone door, there is a faintly more heart palpitating fluctuations.
<br><br>There.
<br><br>I'm afraid that is the core of Jiang Yu's tomb.
<br><br>"I'm afraid this Jiang Yu has half a foot in the Martial Emperor, otherwise how could a Martial Saint have three Saint treasures." Under the veil, Peng Xian'er sighed with emotion.
<br><br>"Yes, looking at its fluctuations, I'm afraid there are better things in that core chamber." The old man following beside Peng Xian'er, the elder of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Chang Jiankong, likewise sighed in admiration.
<br><br>And Yun Xian Que looked at these treasures with a cold smile on his face.
<br><br>"I just wonder, what will be the expression of that Lu Qingshan when he sees this scene?"
<br><br>"Hmph, probably will regret to death!"
<br><br>Lin Bo coldly snorted disdainfully: "But it's better this way, if we really share them a few percent, I don't see how I can give it up!"
<br><br>"That's right, a small local clan is just a clan that will just muddle through, since they can't catch the chance, they don't have that life either."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que nodded in agreement.
<br><br>For a while, looking at these treasures, the crowd of the three major powers had different thoughts.
<br><br>And at this time, the others also rushed over, and when they saw the pile of treasures, their eyes glowed, and they couldn't help themselves.
<br><br>"Brothers, charge!"
<br><br>"So many treasures, can take a little, this life is satisfied!"
<br><br>With this yell, there were dozens of cultivators who had fallen into madness rushed up.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>Fifth Changkong's face was cold and he was about to stop, but the fifth formation on the side pulled him back at the right time.
<br><br>He was just about to ask why, but he found that the three Saint Treasures blossomed into black fog, and almost instantly, they made the dozen people who had rushed up, fly into oblivion.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong said in horror.
<br><br>"If my guess is right, it should be that this tomb room is heavy with Yin Qi, and over time, the three Saint Treasures have absorbed a lot of Yin Qi, which will be released as someone approaches." The fifth formation explained.
<br><br>"Then what should we do?" Yun Xian Que asked.
<br><br>"I'm afraid we can only wait, wait for the Yin Qi to dissipate automatically." Long Jiankong said.
<br><br>The crowd nodded in tacit agreement.
<br><br>Looked at each other, then find their own ground and sit down.
<br><br>The others saw this, and also the same distance apart and sit down.
<br><br>"Take a good rest!" The fifth formation reminded: "Although now seems calm, but when the Yin Qi dispersed, I'm afraid to avoid the struggle, then what can get, only according to their abilities."
<br><br>Saying that, the fifth formation took a glance at where the two formations of Peng Xian'er and Yun Xian Que were.
<br><br>At the same time, they also looked their eyes over.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>All of them were playing the same calculations.
<br><br>The current calm was just the calm before the storm.
<br><br>"This thing actually doesn't even break use?"
<br><br>In the Earth Gate Hall, Wu Chang'an looked at the button he had pressed and frowned deeply.
<br><br>It was actually useless?
<br><br>Unable to help, he pressed another button.
<br><br>After looking at it, it still didn't work?
<br><br>Can not help, he pressed another button.
<br><br>After several organ buttons were pressed in succession without effect, Wu Chang'an broke into a frenzy and pressed all the organs in one breath.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>And at the same time when these buttons were pressed, the whole hall roared and trembled.
<br><br>"Swoosh!"
<br><br>Countless poison arrows, piercing through, came with a compelling aura.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>At the same time, many small holes emerged from the walls, and a black fog silently diffused out.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>Above the head, countless like a sword light cold awning full release covered, with a thick killing machine.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>Accompanied by a few beast roar, and out of thin air appeared a few phantom emitting black gas, with a strong pressure rushed out ......
<br><br>Watching this, Wu Changan's face changed greatly, his ghostly body turned into a phantom in the hall, dodging nimbly.
<br><br>While avoiding the danger, while clenching his teeth.
<br><br>"This is the biggest crisis I've ever encountered in my life, it seems I can only use my bottom card."
<br><br>While murmuring, a scroll was taken out by him.
<br><br>"Oooh, I only have a hundred copies of this kind of scroll that ignores formation transmission, ah, using up one leaves only ninety-nine copies." Looking at the scroll in his hand, Wu Changan was full of reluctance, but there was no choice but to grit his teeth and use the scroll.
<br><br>With a pillar of light produced, Wu Chang'an suddenly disappeared.
