"What a big nerve."
<br><br>"A few things that pretend to be gods in the lower realm, and they actually want to wipe us out."
<br><br>"What a joke."
<br><br>Black Feather's words immediately caused the crowd present to laugh wildly.
<br><br>Especially one of the demons named Cloud Elephant, he relied on his elephant body, his strength was infinite, and he had few enemies among his class, so he had never put Black Feather in his eyes.
<br><br>So at this moment.
<br><br>He laughed coldly and bluntly: "Black Feather, Black Feather, although I had guessed that you were ambitious and might betray the Lord of the Continent, but I never thought that you would be so blind, you defected from whom is not good, but ran to the lower world to join such a few things."
<br><br>"So be it."
<br><br>"We were just looking at how to give credit to the Lord of the Continent, and then you made such a scene, so in that case, we will just take you down and take back the Soul Regent Blade from the Lord of the Continent."
<br><br>But in the face of cloud elephant and other people's clamor, black feather stood behind the skeleton Ben Wei, jumping and screaming: "cloud elephant you shameless little mole, what are you, also dare to force chatter, you come ah, have the guts you come ah, black feather master is standing here waiting for you to come, you can touch me a sweat hair I believe with you."
<br><br>Black feather this arrogant posture, immediately let the cloud elephant anger. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Woo!"
<br><br>An elephant sounded.
<br><br>He fiercely transformed into a huge shadow, his huge body broke straight through the top of the clouds and looked at Black Feather from above.
<br><br>"Black feather, since you provoke me so much, then I will answer your words, you get out and suffer death." The cloud elephant sent out a voice full of killing intent.
<br><br>Feeling the cloud elephant this heavy aura, black feather head suddenly shrink, face full of heart weakness, swallowed and said: "You, you can't kill me, because I have Lord Bone, I Lord Bone can blast you into slag with one punch."
<br><br>After saying that, he hastily shrank to the back of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Cloud Elephant looked coldly at Bone Ben Wei and asked soberly, "Since Black Feather has defected to you you, and he said so, so you are very strong?"
<br><br>"Of course I, Lord Bones, am very strong, didn't you hear what I just said, he can blow you into slag with one punch!" Black feather emerged from his head to loudly pick up the cant.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, blast me into slag with one punch?"
<br><br>The towering cloud elephant laughed.
<br><br>His huge paw landed on the ground and most of the mountain range was flattened, while he looked at Skeleton Ben Wei and asked with playfulness, "So, you can really blast me into slag with one punch?"
<br><br>"Of course not, one punch certainly can't blast you into slag."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei, who was watching the drama, finally emitted a voice.
<br><br>"Haha!"
<br><br>"You're a lot more sensible than Black Feather."
<br><br>Yun Xiang laughed.
<br><br>In his opinion, this what Lord Skeleton strength was pressed like that, and he didn't know what kind of nerves Black Feather had committed dared to betray and provoke him.
<br><br>But he was sure that this skeleton Ben Wei under the threat of his kick just now ......
<br><br>afraid.
<br><br>And Black Feather's face also changed.
<br><br>Anxiously, he shouted towards Bone Ben Wei: "Big brother, your strength can clearly blow him to slag with one punch, why say no ah, big brother you don't pit me ah, but I have bet all my treasure on you ah!"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei inclined his head to look at him and asked rhetorically, "When did I say that I could blow him to slag with one punch?"
<br><br>"Ah, big brother you?"
<br><br>Black Feather was instantly anxious.
<br><br>Could it be that Skeleton Ben Wei was not as strong as he thought?
<br><br>But being able to create immortals with his bare hands shouldn't be!
<br><br>However, Yun Xiang and the others variously romped and laughed.
<br><br>"Black feather ah black feather, it seems that your new defected master, not good ah!"
<br><br>"Yes black feather, what kind of nerves are you guilty of?"
<br><br>"This new master of yours, you are afraid to face the cloud elephant, if the continental lord himself, would not that be?"
<br><br>The mocking voice fell as in Black Feather's ears, making Black Feather turn helpless for a while.
<br><br>Just when he didn't know what to do, the palm of Bone Ben Wei suddenly fell on Black Feather's shoulder.
<br><br>"Little Blackie ah, what are you panicking about?"
<br><br>"Also, you're not arrogant enough to follow me, facing a group of trash, what do you think you're being a wimp?"
<br><br>"Also, the words you said just now, I have to criticize you most severely, I can obviously hold this group of trash into the air with one finger, how can you say that I blasted that trash into slag with one punch?"
<br><br>"You say, are you making it difficult for me?"
<br><br>"How can you be the commander of my master's back mountain when you're like this?"
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei's words caused Black Feather to let out a dry cry, and his eyes instantly lit up as he said excitedly, "So Big Brother I should?"
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>"That's right."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei kicked Black Feather in the ass and shouted, "Give this scum boy your head up, chest up, and ass up."
<br><br>"Take one more step out and shout at this group of mole crickets that all of you present are trash and trash!"
<br><br>With the skeleton Ben Wei backing, black feather two steps out, chest up shouted out.
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>Instantly ignited the anger of the crowd.
<br><br>They never expected that Bone Ben Wei was actually teasing them, and actually dared to release such treacherous words.
<br><br>They were originally the best in the Immortal World, when had they ever been belittled like this?
<br><br>In a flash, a huge aura was exposed from them, and a pair of murderous intent-driven gazes focused on Black Feather and Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>There were also countless immortal power fluctuations, coalescing in the surrounding air, apparently secretly coalescing attacks and preparing to make a move.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Black feather's scalp tingled.
<br><br>Both feet tremble.
<br><br>This shout out cool is cool, but this face pressure is also huge ah.
<br><br>He couldn't help but look back at Bone Ben Wei and asked tremblingly, "Lord Bone, I, what should I do?"
<br><br>"What are you afraid of, just a bunch of hot chickens."
<br><br>"If they dare to attack you, just shout out that Bone Ben Wei is the most handsome, and then blast out with one punch, I'll cover you to get rid of them."
<br><br>This words.
<br><br>Once again, the anger of the crowd was touched.
<br><br>Repeatedly being picked to look down on, their killing intent towards Bone Ben Wei and Black Feather was dense to the extreme.
<br><br>Finally, under the immortal power fluctuation, the sky suddenly rose with a huge movement.
<br><br>A raised hand poked down from the sky through the clouds.
<br><br>An elephant foot, like the pillar of the sky, directly erected down.
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>The sky is burning, the ground is trembling, spatial cracks have torn and opened, twisted to together.
<br><br>Under the powerful pressure, black feather has long been scared trembling.
<br><br>However, he still listened to Bone Ben Wei, his mouth shouted Bone Ben Wei is the most handsome, then smothered his head and raised his fist.
<br><br>Seeing this, a teasing voice came out from Cloud Elephant's mouth.
<br><br>"Ridiculous."
<br><br>"Two jumping clowns, lowly creatures from the lower realms, such pedestrian-like tactics, really think that with a slogan, they dare to challenge the might of heaven?"
<br><br>"Today you will be judged directly!"
<br><br>PS: May those who have a heart in the world be married at last!
