Time.
<br><br>Little by little, it passed.
<br><br>The pair of eyes in the sky, on the other hand, with a half-hearted gaze, kept staring at the old hen that hatched the egg.
<br><br>Mo Tianji also sat beside Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>For Jia Jia Qin to be able to hatch a chick with the Nine Heavenly Divine Phoenix bloodline, she did not have half a doubt.
<br><br>After all, there are still a bunch of them in the Heaven and Earth Gate now, the master let Chi a bucket from bursting to stewed mushrooms, ate a whole month did not finish.
<br><br>Just, what makes her puzzled is why Jia Jia Qin can know, why the yellow sky giant beast has the idea of continuing the bloodline.
<br><br>Unable to resist, she asked out softly towards Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>"This is very simple, for any species, it is their instinct to continue their offspring, it is considered an innate behavior."
<br><br>"In addition, after studying the books "On how poultry is raised" and "How to know the inner thoughts of animals through details" in the collection of scriptures, a look, a move of any animal, I will be able to know what they are thinking."
<br><br>"Just like the old sow climbing the pen, it must be the time of mating." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Therefore it is not surprising that I was able to judge the thoughts of Huang Tian through heavy details."
<br><br>"What's more, Huang Tian is a giant beast from several eras ago, his kind, I'm afraid there are none left in the entire Immortal River Continent, so how to carry on the bloodline must be one of his knots in his heart."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin patiently explained all this towards Mo Tianji.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"Senior brother has been taught."
<br><br>Mo Tianji revealed a dawning realization and arched his hand towards Jia Jia Qin.
<br><br>Today, through Jia Jia Qin's speech, she was able to open her eyes and gain a lot of knowledge.
<br><br>And at that moment.
<br><br>The old hen clucked and got up.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin retrieved the old hen as soon as he could, and laughed leisurely: "We'll see."
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>Huang Tian's huge pupils stared deadly at the egg.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>A soft sound of breaking the shell sounded.
<br><br>Then it was seen that a chicken with nine-colored feathers broke out of its shell.
<br><br>The moment it broke its shell, Huang Tian, who was hidden in the shadows, stared at it with wide eyes.
<br><br>The huge body also could not help but tremble.
<br><br>This chick ......
<br><br>This chick actually really possessed the Nine Heavens divine Phoenix bloodline.
<br><br>It was really too unbelievable.
<br><br>"You, how did you manage to do all this?"
<br><br>His heart was filled with unrest and he asked anxiously.
<br><br>"It doesn't matter how I bred it, the key is that I bred a chick with the Nine Heavenly Divine Phoenix bloodline in front of you, you should be able to believe that if I want to breed an offspring with your bloodline, it's not difficult." Jia Jia Qin said leisurely.
<br><br>"But, under the whole day, my clan bloodline is only one of me, how can I unilaterally continue the bloodline?" Huang Tian asked urgently.
<br><br>"Simple, I can take your bloodline and make a test tube."
<br><br>"Test tube?"
<br><br>"You don't understand even if I say so, you just need to know that I can easily help you continue your bloodline."
<br><br>Huang Tian moved his huge throat.
<br><br>Gulped down a mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>The heart was excited, but at the same time, it was filled with apprehension and disbelief.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>As any species, who would like to be extinct in the world?
<br><br>Let alone a rare bloodline like him, who had lived for countless eras and had long possessed a divine will, how much he wanted to have a descendant bloodline.
<br><br>He held his breath, looked solemnly at Jia Jia Qin, and asked, "Then what do you need me to do?"
<br><br>"Of course it is to be used for me, unconditionally for me."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin said slowly and methodically, "Also need to tell you, my esteemed master likes to eat wild game, if your master takes a fancy to your meat, you must also unconditionally contribute your body and serve it to my master's table."
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>"In return, I will help you and continue your offspring."
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin confidently lifted his head.
<br><br>Staring lightly into Huang Tian's eyes, he quietly waited for Huang Tian's answer.
<br><br>The space fell into silence.
<br><br>Only Huang Tian's heavy snort.
<br><br>And after a short silence, finally came Huang Tian's voice.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>"I promise you, but what you promised me, you must do."
<br><br>Huang Tian said solemnly.
<br><br>"Definitely."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin nodded with a smile and continued, "Your cultivation is more unstable now, you should recover well for a day first, I will come back tomorrow to pick you up!"
<br><br>"Okay, no problem."
<br><br>Huang Tian answered.
<br><br>"Senior sister let's go!" Jia Jia Qin said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Mo Tianji nodded and looked at this senior brother of hers with eyes filled with a strange look.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin's performance today really impressed her.
<br><br>She had thought that the two sides would go through a big battle, or even all sorts of tangles, before Jia Jia Qin was able to rely on the bottom card of the Heaven and Earth Sect to take down Huang Tian in a close and dangerous way.
<br><br>But I did not expect that it was so light and easy.
<br><br>Even he had no qualms about saying to Huang Tian that when the future master wanted to eat meat, he would serve Huang Tian to the table such words.
<br><br>It seems that there is no fear that Huang Tian will be angry, and even less fear that Huang Tian will not agree.
<br><br>This kind of strategizing and taking Huang Tian in hand powerful confidence, simply opened her eyes.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>To be able to become a disciple of the master, none of them is a frugal lamp.
<br><br>All are truly super demons!
<br><br>And after the two Jia Jia Qin left, the sealing place heaven and earth cracked, then a huge lava beast came out of the crack.
<br><br>It was Huang Tian's original body.
<br><br>He felt the fresh air of the outside world and hurriedly adjusted his breath.
<br><br>There was even a faint trace of urgency in his eyes.
<br><br>He knew in his heart that he had sealed several eras, even if he recovered his peak strength, this would be the end of his life, and he would not be able to achieve higher.
<br><br>It is really a bad life.
<br><br>To be able to use his own life, in exchange for the continuation of the bloodline, worth it!
<br><br>A day passes in a flash.
<br><br>At this moment, in the imperial city of the Genting Empire, gathered full of people.
<br><br>Led by the World Extermination and the Genting king, each face was filled with the color of expectation.
<br><br>Planned for so long.
<br><br>Finally is waiting for this day.
