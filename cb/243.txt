But just as her voice fell, she noticed several streams of light, carrying a powerful aura swept towards this side.
<br><br>Li Yihan's heart thumped!
<br><br>Never thought that the people from Wind Cloud Valley and Blowing Snow Villa would come so quickly.
<br><br>And what made her feel even more gloomy was that the people who came were not the usual people from these two major powers.
<br><br>On the left.
<br><br>It's the people from the Snow Blower Villa.
<br><br>The leader is the young master of the Blowing Snow Villa, the fifth Changkong, in addition to the elders of the Blowing Snow Villa, the fifth formation.
<br><br>On the right.
<br><br>It is the people of the Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>The leader is the eldest lady of Wind and Cloud Valley, Yun Xian Que, following her are also the elders of Wind and Cloud Valley, Yang Mu and Yang Sen, the two elders.
<br><br>Li Yihan's face was pale. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Didn't expect to come with such characters.
<br><br>The fifth Changkong and Yun Xian Que were recognized geniuses in the entire Nansha, not only were their identities exalted and their talents heaven defying, their own strength had also reached the peak of Martial Sect.
<br><br>And in addition to the two of them, that fifth formation, Yang Mu and Yang Sen are even more needless to say.
<br><br>They are true Martial Zun powerhouses!
<br><br>These people for Li Yihan, is an absolute big shot, the usual she can only look up to.
<br><br>And a few of them put together a lineup that simply made people feel powerless.
<br><br>In front of these people, I'm afraid that Pork Rong and the others couldn't leave even if they wanted to.
<br><br>But she, a small Martial King powerhouse, could only be helpless, and could only pray that Pork Rong and the others would be able to retreat in one piece under the attack of the two major powers.
<br><br>"As expected of a big power like Wind and Cloud Valley and Snow Blowing Villa, they came really fast!"
<br><br>"Yes, not only did the two great geniuses come, there are also three Martial Exalted Elders!"
<br><br>"This kind of lineup is simply terrifying!"
<br><br>"Humph, I'll see how those arrogant old men will still be arrogant next!"
<br><br>"I'm afraid that they will directly kneel down in fear!"
<br><br>The crowd in the room, there were voices of discussion.
<br><br>And Cheng Wu, who had a bruised nose and a swollen face, was unusually excited at this moment.
<br><br>"A few old undead things, our experts from Wind and Cloud Valley and Blowing Snow Villa are already here, wait a minute, just kneel down and cry to your father and mother!"
<br><br>Cheng Wu gnashed his teeth and drank.
<br><br>The Yun Xian Que and the Fifth Longkong who flew from afar observed the scene, and after they found that their disciples were all injured, they also turned full of anger.
<br><br>Daring to make a move against their two sects' disciples in Nansha, how dare they!
<br><br>"Yun Xian Que, these few people dare to make a move against the disciples of our two sects, I'm afraid that their strength is not weak!" Fifth Longkong transmitted a voice towards Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>"Hm!"
<br><br>Immortal Cloud Que similarly transmitted back, "It seems that this time we will have to join forces."
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Fifth Longkong gritted his teeth and transmitted, "Injuring our disciples in front of so many people, if we don't teach these people a hard lesson, I'm afraid that other powers will look down on our two clans, so we should use a thunderous force to beat them beyond their turn."
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que nodded with the same approval, while instructing the two behind him, "Please also ask the two elders to come along with me."
<br><br>Yang Mu and Yang Sen both nodded their heads.
<br><br>Almost at the same time, the experts of the two great sects swept in the sky and gathered to attack.
<br><br>The entire sky was shrouded in dense Yuan Qi fluctuations.
<br><br>Under the pressure of their attacks, the entire ground felt a huge pressure, and those who were slightly weaker felt as if they were about to kneel down.
<br><br>"It's over!"
<br><br>Feeling the powerful fluctuations in the sky, Li Yihan used his cultivation to painstakingly support himself to be able to stand firm, his face was pale, and he prayed for Pork Rong and the others in his heart.
<br><br>A blow from so many people combined.
<br><br>It is bound to beat these enemies who wounded his disciples of the two clans, without the slightest chance of turning back.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que thought this way.
<br><br>The attack in his hand was getting closer and closer to those few people.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Hmm?
<br><br>The appearance of these people ......
<br><br>Seems to be ......
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>She suddenly remembered something, and without saying a word, she turned around and fled.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"What the hell are these few people from Wind and Cloud Valley up to?"
<br><br>Fifth Changkong looked at Yun Xian Que and their sudden change of direction and was filled with confusion.
<br><br>But it was just that.
<br><br>Even though he didn't know what change of direction Yun Xian Que and the others were up to, Fifth Longkong thought that with his and Fifth Formation's strength, they would still be able to take down these few people.
<br><br>Wait!
<br><br>They are?
<br><br>Suddenly, he also found something.
<br><br>At once, his soul flew away and his heart jumped out violently.
<br><br>His mouth broke into curses, "Doggone Yun Xian Que, actually did not warn me earlier."
<br><br>While cursing and swearing, Fifth Longkong and Fifth Formation also turned around and ran.
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>"You damned old men, bear the wrath of my Wind and Cloud Valley and Blowing Snow Villa!" Cheng Wu stared straight at Pork Rong and the others and shouted loudly.
<br><br>The rest of the people were also full of cold smiles, expecting the downfall of these people.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>The attack that was expected to arrive was late, and even the pressure of that attack coming down had suddenly become less.
<br><br>What's going on?
<br><br>The crowd was puzzled and looked up toward the sky.
<br><br>This does not look nothing, a look at the great.
<br><br>Just a moment ago, the fifth long air and other people are still aggressive, condensing all kinds of attacks, suddenly in mid-air to turn around rapidly, the urgent appearance makes them step in mid-air legs, a straight stare, afraid that the speed is not fast enough.
<br><br>That look, like a cat seeing a mouse.
<br><br>Especially the fifth long air, panic face their own native weapons, the imperial fan do not want, directly fell to the ground.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The crowd's eyes were wide, completely unaware of what had happened.
<br><br>But however, the fifth long air and other people's souls just finished dropping their heads, a heavy voice, at the same time, fell in their minds.
<br><br>"Since you're here, why bother to leave?"
<br><br>The voice fell, and a huge force acted on their bodies, pulling them down from the sky.
<br><br>A group of people, in a mess, fell to the ground.
<br><br>Knowing that they couldn't get away, the fifth Changkong was the first to react and immediately rolled on the ground, kneeling on one knee.
<br><br>Smiling, revealing a mouthful of white teeth: "Good day, Grand Master Wang."
<br><br>"Yo, it's you little brats, what, want to buy a house?" At this time, Pork Rong walked out and looked at them from a high position, emitting a meaningful voice.
<br><br>Seeing this, the fifth long empty heart another thud, looking at the stomach of chest hair, heart alarm.
<br><br>How this one, also in ......
<br><br>"Pig, pig master!"
<br><br>Can't help but, the fifth long air other foot also quietly fell to the ground, legs kneeling on the ground, tilted his head forced smile said: "You also ah!"
<br><br>And Yun Xian Que a few people also followed the fifth long air, poof, in unison kneeled to the ground.
