"Brother, is it safe to bury here?"
<br><br>A remote place in Pingjiang City, a skeleton in black robes holding a shovel, is digging a pit with a dog.
<br><br>"Don't worry, no one will even come here normally." The black-robed man said with confidence.
<br><br>"So now, we should be rich, right?"
<br><br>The dog's two paws were also helping to dig the pit, while saying towards the black-robed man.
<br><br>"Of course, we are already one of the richest, able to bag the whole Pingjiang City ladies, yo!" The black-robed man said with a smirk.
<br><br>"In fact, brother, there has been a doubt!" The dog scratched his head with his paw and asked.
<br><br>"What doubt?"
<br><br>"Uh ...... is that I was wondering, brother when you went to the Yee Hong Yuan, how exactly did you solve it?"
<br><br>"Tailbone?"
<br><br>"Toes?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The black robe suddenly stopped the work in his hand.
<br><br>"Qing ah!" He shouted.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Do you know that revealing people's shortcomings, giving birth to a son may be without fart y?" The black-robed man lectured at length: "Besides, is your brother that vulgar? Your brother I want the feeling of being surrounded by girls, do you understand that feeling?"
<br><br>"Uh, seems to understand some."
<br><br>The dog scratched his head and nodded his head with seeming understanding.
<br><br>"Hurry up and dig the pit, brother has to go find the feeling later." The black-robed man said.
<br><br>"Okay, brother!"
<br><br>A bone and a dog, continue to dig a pit.
<br><br>"I can't actually catch up."
<br><br>In mid-air, Peng Xian'er and Long Jiankong stepped into the air and frowned as they looked at Jiang Yu, who had already lost his trail.
<br><br>After all, Jiang Yu's speed was too fast, plus they had just delayed for a moment, so at the moment was completely invisible traces.
<br><br>"There is a person below, seems to be a cultivator, and also with a demon wolf, should we ask?" Long Jiankong looked at the black-robed man with a wolf below and asked towards Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er nodded, and the two lowered and went, suspended at a height of three feet.
<br><br>"Hey, let me ask you, did you see any movement just now?" Long Sword Air asked from a high position.
<br><br>"Brother, someone is talking to you." The dog said softly.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>The black-robed man nodded, then continued, "Qing ah, I was thinking, how much money should I usually carry on my body?"
<br><br>"This, I think it depends on your needs!" The dog said.
<br><br>"I still need quite a lot, but I'm afraid to carry too much to be found by the master." The black-robed man said naggingly.
<br><br>"Then this is indeed a bit not very good!" The dog was also in a difficult position for a while.
<br><br>Looking at this strength is not good one person and a wolf actually still chatting with himself, completely ignored him, long sword empty face suddenly became gloomy, voice aggravated drink: "I am talking to you two, did not hear?"
<br><br>"But brother I think you ha, you can pay off a month's worth of money in advance to the Yee Hong Yuan, so that every day directly to the people on the line, no need to carry money on you at all." The dog had a bright idea and said.
<br><br>"Aiya, Qing ah, worthy of you ah, really smart, good idea ah!" The black-robed man immediately came out with an appreciative voice.
<br><br>"What's the point, after all, brother you are so excellent, and following you I, can not think of such a little way?" The dog laughed and patted the rainbow fart.
<br><br>"What is said is said, things are gathered together, the best people are always with the best people!" The black-robed man said rather proudly.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>On the side of the long sword empty but full of anger.
<br><br>This man and wolf, did they really not know the sky is high, and were actually chatting about themselves, completely ignoring him.
<br><br>Could it be that he, the martial daddy, had no deterrent effect anymore?
<br><br>Can't help but, his body aura reveals, martial dwelling cultivation emanates out, carrying a faint killing intent voice, word by word out.
<br><br>"You two, are you looking for death?"
<br><br>"Qing ah?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Do you find this person a bit annoying?" The black-robed man asked.
<br><br>"Yes, a little."
<br><br>The dog nodded in deep agreement.
<br><br>"Forget it, send him away!"
<br><br>The black-robed man put down the shovel in his hand, clapped his hands, and looked at Long Jiankong.
<br><br>A cold smile spread across Long Jiankong's face.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>People are guilty of being cheap.
<br><br>If you don't come up with something, people won't take you seriously at all, and now that his Martial Exaltation aura was revealed, wasn't he still going to be obedient?
<br><br>However, he was just about to open his mouth.
<br><br>Underneath that black robe, a white fist stretched out.
<br><br>"What a lot of bullshit."
<br><br>The voice fell, and Long Jiankong was instantly hammered away and smashed out of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er's face changed greatly, but she couldn't have time to fear as the black-robed man turned on her again.
<br><br>"You too."
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>Another punch, Peng Xian'er directly followed in the footsteps of Long Sword Air ......
<br><br>"Brother, didn't you say that no one would come here, look at the two that just smashed away isn't it?" The dog said, "That money hidden here is not safe ah!"
<br><br>"Right oh!"
<br><br>The black-robed man suddenly realized, "Then what to do?"
<br><br>"I saw the martial arts school dig a pit to bury it?" The dog had a bright idea and said, "The most dangerous place is the safest place ah!"
<br><br>"How clever, go!"
<br><br>Two people carrying the money bag, sneak back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng and Lu Qingshan were sitting opposite each other, playing Go.
<br><br>"You've lost."
<br><br>Yi Feng's white pieces fell, revealing a satisfied smile.
<br><br>"Sir is really powerful, I lost again." Lu Qingshan was full of shame.
<br><br>"I don't blame you, after all, you just learned it too."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, because he knew that if he wanted to improve his chess skills, he couldn't always play the same kind of chess, no, after Xiangqi he took up Weiqi whole again.
<br><br>But playing chess with Lu Qingshan, a rookie, was really not much fun, so he lay down on the recliner and took out a half-finished small wooden sculpture next to him.
<br><br>After all, there are other tasks, so in the spare time of playing chess, Yi Feng will also improve to improve the carving skills.
<br><br>During this period of time, the carving was not yet complete, but the level was not low.
<br><br>"Ah sir, have you heard about the incident outside Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan sat aside and said softly: "That cemetery is really accurate by you, good things have been short-changed, and this cemetery is simply a scam, that Jiang Yu is not looking for any inheritor at all, but to find someone to take over, and now many cultivators are trapped there by him!"
<br><br>"This kind of thing, ah, you broken old man will not have to worry too much." Yi Feng lightly laughed: "You have to know that evil does not prevail over good, even if the vicious person, there will always be someone to sanction him, maybe today, maybe tomorrow."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's pupils shrank.
<br><br>At once, he felt that Yi Feng's words had a deep meaning.
<br><br>Could it be.
<br><br>Is it that Mr. is going to make a move?
<br><br>He glanced at Yi Feng, who was concentrating on carving.
<br><br>In a short while, the former "Desert Eagle" pistol was carved out by him one by one, lifelike.
<br><br>In the hands of a turn, quite satisfied.
<br><br>However, subconsciously glanced at the crumpled paper on the table, he immediately frowned.
<br><br>This piece of paper was used to play chess because there was no chess board, and the squares were drawn on it to make up for the game.
<br><br>But a few hands down, the paper was crumpled.
<br><br>"Old man, you should be more familiar with Pingjiang City than me, if you come across a good square wooden table, square stone table, get one for me." Yi Feng looked across the old ancestor of Castle Peak and laughed.
<br><br>"Sir is to?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan asked busy.
<br><br>"Oh, used to carve a go board, old so use paper instead is not the way!" Yi Feng said helplessly.
<br><br>"A Go board?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's heart was slightly shocked, and at the same time, his face was a little difficult.
<br><br>After all, the kitchen knife used by Mr. is a holy product, the hoe is also a holy product, and more importantly, the Go table, I'm afraid the minimum is also a holy product, or even something more advanced than a holy product, right?
<br><br>Where could he, Lu Qingshan, get this?
<br><br>So he said embarrassedly, "Sir, I'm afraid it's not easy to get this stuff!"
<br><br>"There is no rush, there will always be one."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"There will always be?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan scratched his head, always felt that Yi Feng's words also had a deep meaning, but he was ignorant and did not know exactly what it meant for a while.
