"Hell!"
<br><br>"Let's not talk about that mysterious man, there should be quite a few people in this city who know about our arrival, how come there is no half-hearted reaction?"
<br><br>Among the black fog, the voices of the people came out.
<br><br>"Hmph, since that person is willing to be a shrinking turtle, not even having the guts to face us, that means this person is not as powerful as imagined!"
<br><br>"Good point, if this person was really that powerful, I'm afraid he would have appeared long ago."
<br><br>"OK, since he wants to hide, the more we have to find him out, gentlemen, in a combined effort a hand, directly boundary divination out where this person is hiding."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>All of them responded.
<br><br>At one time, the black fog in mid-air layer after layer of movement, the whole sky is like becoming a black ocean, waves constantly.
<br><br>As the black ocean moved violently, the boundary divination power that several people had jointly exerted poured into Pingjiang City.
<br><br>For a time, the entire Pingjiang City was like being in the middle of hell. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Sir!"
<br><br>Just a little more at ease, the crowd who sat down to eat noodles couldn't help but put the noodle bowl in their hands and turned their gaze towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Sir, it seems to be more serious."
<br><br>"Yes, if we leave him alone, will something happen?"
<br><br>The crowd said in fear and anxiety.
<br><br>"Buddy, give me another plate of peanut rice."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved at the shopkeeper, then wiped his mouth again before he looked at the crowd and said, "Oh, I told you, it's a small thing, don't take it to heart, it will go away soon!"
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng added towards the shopkeeper: "Remember, give me a pot of wine again."
<br><br>And in Yi Feng's voice fell at the same time, the courtyard slowly and slowly raised his head.
<br><br>Opened his mouth.
<br><br>"Shiver."
<br><br>As if shivering noodles, shuttle ha a mouthful.
<br><br>After a mouthful, slowly re-lowered his head, lying on the ground and dozing.
<br><br>At the same time, the black fog that was rampaging over Pingjiang City was suddenly pulled by a mysterious force ......
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ahhhh!"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"What kind of power is this?"
<br><br>"Quick, quick, save me quickly ......"
<br><br>Without even giving them the slightest time to react, the crowd was drowned in that power, like a canoe in a storm, defenseless, vaguely leaving only intermittent sounds coming from the black fog, until finally completely obliterated ......
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The field.
<br><br>Only a cloud of earth mist remained.
<br><br>The giant face coalesced out of the earth mist looked at the others who had completely lost their breath, and immediately emitted a horrified voice, while also finding the terrifying pulling force enveloping towards him as well.
<br><br>"How terrifying!"
<br><br>"Is this the power of this person?"
<br><br>The voice of the earth mist panicked to the extreme and also reacted in an instant, directly shedding most of his body, leaving an imperceptible dust and fleeing towards the original void.
<br><br>To say that it took a long time, but in fact it all happened in an instant.
<br><br>So, the sky, which was just gray and cloudy, also regained its emptiness in an instant.
<br><br>"See, I told you so!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked up at the sky and couldn't help but say towards the bystanders.
<br><br>"Mister is worthy of being a mister!"
<br><br>"Sir is really accurate!"
<br><br>The crowd pushed out their voices, while they couldn't help but glance towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>They could perceive that it was a force that appeared inside the martial arts school that instantly defeated the black fog.
<br><br>So, Mr. had been prepared!
<br><br>No wonder he didn't even give the black fog a second glance.
<br><br>This time, it was their overthinking ......
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>A tiny stream of light came.
<br><br>Tu Yoyo pupils shrink slightly, frowned and said: "A dust actually has this kind of speed, some kind of immortal weapon or some kind of treasure?"
<br><br>But in the next moment, she anticipated that something was wrong and fiercely exclaimed, "It's a desolate!"
<br><br>After saying that, her face changed greatly.
<br><br>Just a few people together to activate the technique of boundary divination, how long has it been, how come there is only a dust left behind by the desolate, where are the others?
<br><br>Tu Yoyao rushed to meet up and asked in a deep voice: "What happened?"
<br><br>"We encountered ......"
<br><br>The dust carried a part of the intention left by Desolation, remembering that frightening scene, his voice still carried a trembling voice.
<br><br>But just as he was halfway through, an eye slowly and suddenly opened in the martial arts hall in the distance.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>One of the tentacles above the head, faintly lit up.
<br><br>In the sky, a pillar of light that was a million times thinner than a silver needle shot in, causing the one dust left by Desolate to directly turn into nothingness.
<br><br>And his voice also came to an abrupt end, leaving Tu Yoyo alone standing in place in panic, watching the obliteration of Desolation.
<br><br>After reacting, she also took a step, that is, she had already reached ten thousand miles away and disappeared.
<br><br>"What a terrifying power."
<br><br>"Just now, what exactly did it encounter?"
<br><br>"Not only did my doppelganger turn into nothingness, but even that memory of mine just now has completely disappeared."
<br><br>"It's hard to say that this person is a terrifying existence that has crossed two eras?"
<br><br>"That's all, now are not awakened state, defeating a few doppelgangers is nothing, just wait a little longer, who laughs at the end can not say it ......"
<br><br>All over the continent, only a few voices came vaguely, and then silenced the remains of the ......
<br><br>The entire Immortal River Continent, instantly restored calm.
<br><br>As if nothing had happened ......
<br><br>A shake.
<br><br>Then half a year has passed.
<br><br>Today's island, under the busy construction of workers, has been completely established.
<br><br>From the beginning of the island, there was a huge mountain gate erected.
<br><br>On both sides of the gate, there are two bizarre stone sculptures.
<br><br>When you walk into the gate, there is a huge martial arts arena, on which there are many wooden stakes and dummies made by Yi Feng.
<br><br>The middle of the martial arts arena, also built a round altar.
<br><br>This altar Yi Feng is to erect a dragon statue.
<br><br>Dragon well.
<br><br>The world's people must have never seen, plus his carving skills, will certainly let see the people greatly shocked.
<br><br>But now there is empty, because the two old men looking for materials for him have not yet returned.
<br><br>Walking past the martial arts arena, there is the sub-planned building.
<br><br>Book collection pavilion.
<br><br>In order to enrich this book collection pavilion, Yi Feng these months can not be idle, in addition to burned such as the former life of the Vajra Sutra, Mountain and Sea Sutra, Yi Feng also added a lot of spiritual chicken soup and quotations.
<br><br>Even really can not think of what to get good, Yi Feng also went into some of the year's non-mainstream quotes.
<br><br>Such as: those who let you hurt χιń the nucleus trooper to hear the words, all dδц is I lie.
<br><br>Another example: write your inscriptions in the bacillus ↑, sucked into the dried bone.
<br><br>There is no use does not matter, the key is to have, and also to make people can not understand, so that the most able to fool people.
<br><br>Of course, after all, half a year is limited, so even if Yi Feng spent most of the time on this, but the collection of scriptures still looks very empty.
<br><br>So Yi Feng had no choice but to move his many years of treasures in to fill, placed in the corners and out of reach of the hands, so that the surface of the collection of scriptures look decent point.
<br><br>Weapons pavilion.
<br><br>This is much simpler.
<br><br>These years Yi Feng in order to exercise iron, I do not know how many weapons, swords, spears and halberds 18 kinds of weapons have everything.
<br><br>And many were also carved by Yi Feng on the name, such as Yi Tian sword, Dragon Slayer, blue blood sword, Green Dragon Crescent Blade ......
<br><br>In short, the entire weapons pavilion is placed full of.
<br><br>Martial arts pavilion.
<br><br>This is also very easy to be Yi Feng solve.
<br><br>After all, he so many years of ancient martial arts but not in vain refining, taijiquan, bagua fist, mantis fist, Wing Chun fist and other kinds of past life martial arts, are made by Yi Feng, placed in it.
<br><br>Entertainment area.
<br><br>Originally, the sect should not have this, but Yi Feng also thought, people always have to combine work and rest, the former life of the capital group that squeezes people, will not also specialize in making a recreation and leisure room?
<br><br>So, here is connected to the waterfront, in addition to placing the chessboard, piano table, ping-pong table and other things for entertainment, the shallow waterfront area also planted some flowers and plants, nothing to play the piano, chanting poetry for the pair can also be.
<br><br>In addition to these clan necessary planning, is the other conventional construction, residential areas, ah, the council chamber, Yi Feng's special residence ah, etc. ......
<br><br>"Speaking of which, the construction of this sect is almost done, the next thing is to fool people as my disciples and get the qualification to build the sect."
<br><br>In the lake, Yi Feng sat slowly on the shell and fell into a deep thought ......
