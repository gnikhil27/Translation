"This, senior, I'm afraid not!"
<br><br>Lu Chong said with an ugly face, "Every single person in our brigade is personally selected by the Chief Steward ......"
<br><br>"Just!"
<br><br>See Lu Chong face difficult color, Gong Chen disappointed waved his hand and said: "Uncle also understand in his heart, can only blame uncle did not have this life, gossip, let's get down to business!"
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Lu nodded his head, and after giving Gong Chen an apologetic glance, he turned his gaze to the Xining City in front of him.
<br><br>In his heart, he also understood.
<br><br>Business is important.
<br><br>After the business is done, he still needs to go back to the dung.
<br><br>He casually leaked a whiff of breath and passed into the city.
<br><br>This hostile aura immediately caused the fluctuations in the city. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>Four figures swept up in the air.
<br><br>All of them were Ninth Turn Xuan Immortals.
<br><br>"Who are you two, how dare you unleash hostility on Xining City, are you looking for death?"
<br><br>The four people were in an encircling position, surrounding the two Gong Chen in the middle, and an icy cold voice came out.
<br><br>The two were silent.
<br><br>Four Ninth Turn Xuan Immortals were just that.
<br><br>Not even worthy to be put in their eyes, what they wanted to come out was the biggest figure in this kind of town.
<br><br>Seeing the two shut their mouths and ignore their words, the four great XuanXian Immortals' faces were furious.
<br><br>"I think you two are looking for death!"
<br><br>The four people's aura was released, and their powerful pressure spread towards the two people.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as the four were about to make their move, a loud voice from within the city sounded.
<br><br>"Stop."
<br><br>Then it was seen that a woman in green clothes with long hair flew towards this side.
<br><br>"Greetings, Holy Maiden!"
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, the four great XuanXian Immortals hurriedly saluted.
<br><br>"You may go down first!"
<br><br>The woman nodded and instructed towards the four of them.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The four of them retreated.
<br><br>After the four retreated, the woman turned her complicated gaze towards Lu Chong, "Unexpectedly, you actually came out from Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>"Li Qingxuan."
<br><br>Lu Chong was also not expecting that this fianc√©e of his was also here.
<br><br>"Although I don't know how you came out from the Dark Shadow Island, but it's not even close to the previously agreed period, what are you doing here now?"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan couldn't help but say, "This Xining City, is not a place where you can be wild at will, for the sake that we are also considered to have an affinity, we can spare your life this time, so you'd better hurry up and leave, otherwise you can't even leave if you want to."
<br><br>The corner of Lu Chong's mouth raised a sneer and said indifferently, "Although the appointed period has not yet arrived, but it did not say before that it is not allowed to advance."
<br><br>Li Qingxuan was stunned.
<br><br>"In that case, you want to settle the matter of the marriage contract today?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"You've thought it through?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>"Okay!" Li Qingxuan nodded, "In that case, then as previously agreed, if you lose, you will obediently surrender the marriage contract and never appear in front of me again, if you win, I will fulfill the marriage contract."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Lu Chong nodded lightly, then added, "Of course, I have little interest in you."
<br><br>Li Qingxuan froze and asked, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>"Ask Li Hongtian to come out and answer the battle!" Lu Chong said indifferently.
<br><br>The reason why he did so.
<br><br>It was also to save time.
<br><br>With his current strength, defeating Li Qingxuan was just a matter of waving his hand.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>If he really defeated Li Qingxuan, who had been painstakingly cultivated by Li Hongtian, would Li Hongtian be able to rest?
<br><br>Since this is the case.
<br><br>Let's just challenge the big one directly!
<br><br>Save the matter.
<br><br>Otherwise, with this free time, he could have picked several more quarts of dung.
<br><br>"Are you alright in the head?"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan said with a face full of displeasure, "I've wasted enough of my time tangling with you and being incessantly verbal, with this punk like you, what qualifications do you have to ask my master to come out?"
<br><br>"You think my master, will look at you?"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before he could finish his words, he was slapped by Gong Chen and sent flying.
<br><br>"Damn strength is not good, fart talk thief!"
<br><br>Gong Chen said with an impatient face, "Originally I didn't feel much for this girl, after all, you're wasted and it makes sense that she wants to withdraw."
<br><br>"Now a casual contact, the nature is revealed, it seems that it is not a good bird!"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan smashed heavily in the city, pushing to a large area of buildings.
<br><br>And with such a change, it immediately caused an extremely rapid reaction in the city.
<br><br>She spat out a mouthful of blood, got up and shouted with a face full of malice: "Someone, someone has broken into my Xining City, take those two down!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>Countless Xining City experts flew out like locusts, densely attacking towards Gong Chen and the two.
<br><br>"Senior nephew, since I broke through to the True Element Immortal realm, I haven't done much, even looking for people to spar with on the island is always looking for abuse, so now this group of small shrimps, senior uncle first cleaned up for you."
<br><br>Gong Chen coldly smiled and flew out like lightning.
<br><br>The strength of the late True Element Immortal Realm was revealed.
<br><br>A palm slapped out.
<br><br>Space shook.
<br><br>Numerous Xining City experts directly flew out backwards, like dumplings smashing into Xining City.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Late Genuine Immortal Realm?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Qingxuan's face was icy cold.
<br><br>At once, she knew that this kind of strength could not be set up without calling his master out, and she quickly took out a jade slip to transmit a voice.
<br><br>"No need to transmit the voice."
<br><br>She just took out the jade slip, deep in Xining City, a cloaked man with a heavy pressure, stepped into the air and came.
<br><br>Seeing this, countless people knelt down and worshiped on the ground.
<br><br>"Greetings, Master."
<br><br>"Greetings to the continental master."
<br><br>The man nodded indifferently and with a wave of his palm, a force wrapped around Li Qingxuan and gently lifted her to his side.
<br><br>"Qing'er, what's going on?"
<br><br>"It was caused by a late stage True Elemental Immortal realm old man brought by Lu Chong." Qingxuan Li bowed her head and said.
<br><br>"Lu Chong?"
<br><br>The man pondered for a moment before remembering and said, "It's the kid you have a marriage contract with, right!"
<br><br>"Exactly!"
<br><br>Qingxuan Li said.
<br><br>"Come with me!"
<br><br>The man moved his palm, a force lifted Li Qingxuan, and the two of them flew out like lightning.
<br><br>In the next instant, they arrived in front of Lu Chong and Gong Chen, and the two stood in the air.
<br><br>"Has the rightful owner finally come out?"
<br><br>Gong Chen raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>"You are looking for me?"
<br><br>The man's sharp gaze stared at the two Gong Chen, carrying his own aura of superiority, and his voice even carried a powerful oppressive force.
<br><br>"Not bad, looking for you."
<br><br>Gong Chen laughed lightly, "I came today to prepare to settle their marriage contract, once and for all."
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>The man smiled faintly and coldly, unable to see what expression he had, then turned his gaze towards Li Qingxuan and asked faintly, "Qing'er, what do you think."
<br><br>Li Qingxuan let out a cold laugh.
<br><br>Slightly angled his head to look at Lu Chong, sneered: "Lu Chong, although I do not know how you know a late stage of the True Element Immortal realm experts, but you think to bring him here to show off a circle, so that I can make me look at you?"
<br><br>"Even if the old man beside you is stronger, that is not your strength after all, you waste is still a waste."
<br><br>"What's even more ridiculous is that you delude yourself into thinking that the old man next to you challenges my master, so that you can have the capital to negotiate with my master on an equal footing."
<br><br>"Zhu don't know, this idea of yours is too ridiculous."
<br><br>"Because he is still not enough in front of my master, even if the True Element Immortal Realm is stronger, it is still the True Element Immortal Realm, and the Star Immortal Realm, but there is still a big realm difference!"
<br><br>For Li Qingxuan's words.
<br><br>The man Li Hongtian seemed to be very satisfied.
<br><br>He raised his eyebrows and looked at Gong Chen rather derisively and said, "As my disciple said, with you wanting to challenge me with me, you don't have enough capital yet!"
<br><br>"This daddy doesn't have so much time to waste with you, so, you can just lead the death!"
<br><br>Looking at this pair of master and disciple talking to themselves, Lu Chong finally became a bit unbearable and took a step out faintly from beside Gong Chen.
<br><br>"I think, you two misunderstood something."
<br><br>"The one who challenged you is not my senior uncle, but me."
