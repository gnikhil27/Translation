Yi Feng waved his hand and let them continue working, then returned to the room himself.
<br><br>He forced himself to calm down.
<br><br>Rubbing his forehead, he sorted it all out properly in his head.
<br><br>First of all, he was able to confirm that what had happened was definitely not an illusion, it was just that there was absolutely no trace of Mor Sihan in the others' world and memories.
<br><br>Although this was very far-fetched and bizarre, Yi Feng didn't find it unusual.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>He himself crossed over so ghostly things have really happened, and also fused with a system, so the occurrence of such bizarre things he can still afford.
<br><br>In addition, he could feel that Morsihan's appearance was directed at him.
<br><br>It seems to be trying to tell him something, to remind him of what ......
<br><br>Can't help it, Yi Feng felt a thick layer of fog enveloping him.
<br><br>This sitting, another day. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>One day, Yi Feng still did not sort out anything.
<br><br>However, what made Yi Feng slightly relieved was that, recalling the whole contact process with Mor Sihan, she should not have any malice towards himself.
<br><br>"Forget it."
<br><br>"Anyway, it is also a salty fish, as long as you do not get me killed, the time will naturally come to light."
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped his thighs, got up and climbed three bowls of rice, and did not continue to care about this crap.
<br><br>After eating, Yi Feng put Bone Ben Wei as well as Lu Qingshan and some other people in charge of the island, called a meeting.
<br><br>"Recently I will go out, I do not know how long it will take, but the island matters you give me arrangements." Yi Feng seriously explained.
<br><br>"Yes sir, we will definitely complete the task."
<br><br>The people were busy nodding their heads.
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>Yi Feng gave them a trusting glance, and then looked his gaze at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"You, you are given a major task."
<br><br>Yi Feng turned his gaze to Bone Ben Wei and explained, "During my absence, enrich the beasts in the back mountain to at least ......"
<br><br>"One hundred!"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his finger and said a number.
<br><br>The reason for this explanation is because Yi Feng found that Bone Ben Wei is not useless.
<br><br>At least he was able to see that the group of demonic beasts in the back mountain were all ruled by him, and there was a dog bear and centipede following him around all day.
<br><br>This is a proper beast taming master!
<br><br>"Remember, a hundred is best not to repeat, too bad not, common not, best to find the kind of rare understand?"
<br><br>"Rare ...... understand!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei nodded.
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng looked at Bones Ben Wei, the corners of his mouth slightly hooked up and said directly and boldly: "If it's done, come back and I'll give you a major reward!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's spirit lifted and he looked up at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"A one-time reward of ten gold coins for you."
<br><br>Yi Feng said bashfully.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei instantly wilted, sat silently in a corner and drew circles with his head down.
<br><br>Yi Feng ignored him and instead turned his gaze to the other old man.
<br><br>"Old man Qing, you also have a task."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the old man who was holding the boat and said, "You often read and have some ink in your stomach, so I need you to help me find some books and then help me enrich the book collection."
<br><br>"What kind of books do you need, sir?" Old man Qing asked.
<br><br>"En ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his chin and said, "Rare and difficult to understand, ordinary people have never seen, in short, also rare, but really let people read and understand, but also can contain a little bit of truth."
<br><br>"Rare."
<br><br>"Contains reason ......"
<br><br>Old man Qing pondered, then nodded solemnly and said, "Don't worry, sir, I'll try to do it."
<br><br>"Alright, I'm leaving."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly.
<br><br>Early the next morning.
<br><br>Yi Feng rode slowly and set off.
<br><br>Before leaving, Yi Feng took a look at the island.
<br><br>During his absence, the clan infrastructure should be able to be taken care of, and if he joined the clan successfully, he could come back and get the clan creation qualification directly.
<br><br>Then, you can start fooling people.
<br><br>A man and a nest of cows went into the Makufu Mountain Range in this way.
<br><br>Half a day later.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked up at the mountain with thin clouds floating in front of him, and his eyes couldn't help but light up.
<br><br>"I can't believe we've already arrived here, it seems like a long time since I've seen Miss Bai Piao Piao."
<br><br>"Since we're here, let's go take a look!"
<br><br>Yi Feng put away slowly and walked towards the mountain.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>At the top of the hill, he saw the small courtyard with ancient style and excellent scenery again.
<br><br>Just as he walked to the entrance of the courtyard, he saw a familiar appearance.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"It's you?"
<br><br>"How did you find your way here?"
<br><br>It was Mao Mao, the little maid beside Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>When she saw Yi Feng she immediately covered her small mouth and let out a surprised sound, then ran quickly towards the courtyard.
<br><br>In the courtyard.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao was sitting on the pavilion, stroking the long zither with her jade hand.
<br><br>And opposite to her, there were four men with majestic auras standing.
<br><br>"You guys are displeasing me and interfering with my life." Bai Piaoqiao looked up and knitted her pretty brows, saying unhappily.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, now the continent is in turmoil, and you as one of the awakened, and unwilling to return to headquarters with us, so we can only close guard you at the same time, will you here to rearrange the formation, hidden from its trace!" One of the men said, "So please understand."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao frowned and said with slight hesitation, "Can't you temporarily remove the formation?"
<br><br>"No way."
<br><br>The man said firmly, "Your safety is greater than heaven."
<br><br>Listening to the man's firm words, Bai Piaoqiao glanced at the distance and let out a faint sigh.
<br><br>She understood what it meant to be an awakened person.
<br><br>More than that, she understood that after awakening, many things would be out of her hands.
<br><br>So before that, she wanted to see two people again.
<br><br>One, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber.
<br><br>The other ......
<br><br>is a mortal.
<br><br>It's funny, this mortal she has only met twice, can not be considered a friend, let alone a confidant.
<br><br>But for some reason, white floating heart still want to see him.
<br><br>So, the reason she wanted to rip off the formation was to take a chance that the gentle and elegant mortal would come to her again.
<br><br>Because after her complete awakening, I'm afraid the two people will not have any more encounters.
<br><br>But now it seems that it is not possible after all.
<br><br>The strength of these four people, even as the identity of the awakened, daily cultivation boom up she still can not see through.
<br><br>Therefore, they set out the formation, how could a mortal find it ......
<br><br>"Miss, Miss!"
<br><br>Just then, Mao Mao rushed in barefoot towards the courtyard, emitting an anxious voice.
<br><br>"What's so panicky?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao frowned and scolded lightly.
<br><br>"Yes, it's Duke Yi, the Duke Yi who relies on chicken legs is looking for him." Mao Mao breathed heavily while pointing to the door and shouted.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The worried looking Bai Piao Piao heard Mao Mao's words, her expression couldn't help but be startled, her body fiercely stood up.
