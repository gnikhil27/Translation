The wind and sand blowing people can not open their eyes, can only squint a slit.
<br><br>Before Gong Chen met Jiang to the place, Jiang to sit cross-legged here.
<br><br>Squinting at her surroundings, even though the wind and sand blew her eyes, she tried her best to look around carefully, from the slit of her eyes.
<br><br>She had been in that courtyard for a while, and now her body was much better than before.
<br><br>All these days she had been waiting for a letter from that senior.
<br><br>The next moment, he saw a person landing in front of him from mid-air.
<br><br>Jiang to hurriedly stood up.
<br><br>She remembered that this person was really a hoe old man that she had seen in that courtyard before following the seniors.
<br><br>"Senior." She saluted respectfully.
<br><br>"Still remember me." Dai Cang laughed, "The one who brought you before left Shadow Island to go outside on an errand. From now on, it will be me and I who will approach you."
<br><br>Hearing that someone went out, Jiang Zhi's eyes widened and his heart suddenly exploded! One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Really?!" She asked in shock. I didn't expect that not only could that Lord get out, but there was really a way for other people to get out!
<br><br>"What's so surprising about that." Dai Cang said unconcernedly, "If you can serve the Lord, you will also have the chance to go out sooner or later."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi didn't know what to say for a moment and folded his hands in prayer, "Then I wonder if I can serve the Lord?"
<br><br>I thought it was just hope before, but now I know it's not just hope!
<br><br>Rather, it was something that could easily be done!
<br><br>"Come with me, the Lord has returned. She has agreed to take you under her command."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was so excited that she had nowhere to put her hands, "Really?!"
<br><br>"Meaning I can come over with you now?!"
<br><br>"Yes." Dai Cang looked at Jiang Zhi's excitement and was very understanding.
<br><br>Who wouldn't be happy to get such a great opportunity in the sky.
<br><br>Dai Cang quickly led Jiang Zhi to the front of the courtyard.
<br><br>The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to its customers. Apprehensively rubbing his hands, followed behind Dai Cang towards the courtyard.
<br><br>Heart beating like a drum.
<br><br>Very nervous.
<br><br>After following Dai Cang inside, I thought I was going to meet the legendary one, but I did not expect that there was no one in the house.
<br><br>The senior in front of him did not even stay, but walked directly toward the backyard.
<br><br>"Senior, where is that lord?" Jiang Zhi followed while cautiously opening his mouth to ask.
<br><br>"Lord, he took the senior who approached you before and went out on an errand together." Dai Cang said.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was a little disappointed.
<br><br>These days she had been carrying her heart in constant anticipation of meeting the almost heavenly and powerful lord.
<br><br>I thought I could see it today.
<br><br>I didn't think I would have the chance.
<br><br>Dai Cang said, turning her head to look at Jiang Zhi.
<br><br>Just see Jiang to some disappointed look.
<br><br>"Although the Lord is not here, but he has explained, you just need to make an oath of allegiance to him, you can stay." Dai Cang said, happy to see Jiang Zhi lift his head once again.
<br><br>"Right, and, later I pick some grapes and fruits for you." Dai Cang said, "After you eat it, fix it properly."
<br><br>Saying that, he stopped to think, "It's best to find a quiet place to eat."
<br><br>"Yes." Jiang Zhi answered, thinking that she could eat the grapes in the courtyard, the one that was better than the top immortal pills in the immortal world, and the melon ......
<br><br>she couldn't contain her inner joy.
<br><br>Soon, Jiang Zhi made an oath of allegiance and became an official member of this place.
<br><br>The elder lady carrying the vegetable basket came over and placed the small plate containing melons and grapes in front of Jiang Zhi, "Speaking of which, this counts as your initiation gift."
<br><br>"Don't be in a hurry, find a quiet place to eat slowly."
<br><br>Another reminder to be in a quiet place ......
<br><br>Jiang to look down and saw in the plate, only two grapes, and a small bite of melon.
<br><br>Seeing this, the elder woman said, "You do not mind less, more you may not be able to bear."
<br><br>"Not too much not too much." Jiang to rush back, "There is one I am satisfied!"
<br><br>The lady smiled and went out to work after a few words of courtesy.
<br><br>Jiang to look at the plate of melons and fruits, but also do not dare to end, afraid to accidentally fall to the ground.
<br><br>She rubbed her hands, looked at the surroundings, but decided to listen to the seniors and find a quiet and deserted place to eat slowly.
<br><br>She carefully picked up the plate, found a quiet and unoccupied place, and sat down.
<br><br>She carefully put a grape into her mouth.
<br><br>In a moment.
<br><br>In an instant, a powerful force almost lifted her sky!
<br><br>At that moment she understood why senior had asked her to find a quiet place!
<br><br>The next instant, she immediately sat up straight and began to exhale her luck!
<br><br>The farmer working in the yard outside, either raised his head to wipe his sweat, and looked at that spot in passing.
<br><br>At the end of the night, a force spread out from the air.
<br><br>"It seems that the little girl has broken through. Good talent." Dai Cang was outside, looking at the spot and said.
<br><br>"There is no such thing as talent in front of the Lord. Even if the talent is poor, with the Lord's stuff, it can become a genius." The elder lady carrying the basket picked up, "If there's no breakthrough, that's the problem."
<br><br>"That's true." Dai Cang nodded his head in agreement.
<br><br>At the same time, the quiet place Jiang to slowly opened his eyes.
<br><br>Underneath the calm face was a lake of shocked and churning heart.
<br><br>Onlookers know that these gourds and grapes are powerful.
<br><br>But only she, at this moment only profoundly understand, how powerful.
<br><br>She encountered a bottleneck when she first entered the reincarnation realm, and never broke through for so many years.
<br><br>There was a time before trying to force a breakthrough bottleneck cultivation, almost went off the rails.
<br><br>It took the strength of the clan to save her.
<br><br>After the rescue, she did not dare to cultivate again. If you are not careful by the bottleneck stuck in the main fire into the devil, no one can save her.
<br><br>This time, the reason she can be so hopeful, but also because of this bottleneck.
<br><br>And these melon grapes, directly into her bottleneck magic barrier!
<br><br>Not only that, but also let her cultivation soar.
<br><br>The speed of cultivation improvement was astounding!
<br><br>Jiang Zhi took a deep breath, suppressing the shock and trembling in her heart.
<br><br>This time she no longer had any doubts.
<br><br>Here, was the one that she had calculated with the Heavenly Disk, the Heavenly Great Qi!
<br><br>Sun Moon Sect, in the sect.
<br><br>Yi Feng led Gong Chen to a deserted corner. He took a look around.
<br><br>Seeing no one, he slowly opened his mouth.
<br><br>"This time, I brought you out, I have two things to instruct you."
<br><br>"Yes." Gong Chen stood in front of Yi Feng with his head down and listened carefully with his ears open.
<br><br>"The first thing, within this Sun Moon Sect, there is a peak for the Sun Moon Peak. The peak master Guo Shijie, you find an opportunity to get rid of him." Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"I wonder what that person's cultivation level is?" Gong Chen added and asked.
<br><br>"A mere Ninth Turn Xuan Xian." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, Gong Chen was a bit puzzled, "Just a Ninth Turn Xuan Xian, wouldn't the Lord be able to destroy him with a snap of his fingers?"
<br><br>He even went to the trouble of returning to Dark Shadow Island to bring him out.
<br><br>Gong Chen was a little confused.
<br><br>Yi Feng heard this question, his heart thumped!
<br><br>It's over, it's going to be exposed!
