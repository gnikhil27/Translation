Just before Guo Shijie hit that disciple, the whole person was suspended in the air.
<br><br>Above, Patriarch Sima Zhen had already stood up from his seat, slightly raising his hand to look at Guo Shijie gloomily.
<br><br>"Guo Shijie, how dare you!"
<br><br>He said, his voice tinged with killing intent, "Not only did you privately destroy the outer sect's secret realm, but you also dared to murder the outer sect elders and peak master!"
<br><br>"Sovereign, it really wasn't me!" Guo Shijie no longer howled, at this moment he only felt terrified.
<br><br>His entire body was squeezed in mid-air by a big invisible hand, struggling and trembling.
<br><br>"Still trying to sophistry!" The Sovereign's anger had risen.
<br><br>Not only did he not admit his mistake, but he kept on sophistry!
<br><br>Saying that, Sima Zhen turned his head to look at the people around him, his gaze sullen.
<br><br>"This seat hates intra-clan fighting, if anyone dares to plot against the elders again, regardless of the outer and inner sects, the downfall will be like this!"
<br><br>Said, holding Guo Shijie's big invisible hand suddenly tightened. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Guo Shijie's scalp instantly tingled, feeling that death was just a hair's breadth away from him!
<br><br>The patriarch, the patriarch, I swear to God I did not do the plan to kill them! Otherwise, the heavens will strike lightning, after death will not enter the reincarnation to infernal hell!!!"
<br><br>"Uh ......" Guo Shijie's voice abruptly stopped, the whole person was pinched into strips, the eyes burst out, the whole person's demeanor has wandered in the edge of death!
<br><br>But, the next moment, Sima Zhen did not tighten the big hand again.
<br><br>He narrowed his eyes and looked at Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Then he heavily slammed the man down on the main hall!
<br><br>"Bang!!!" The ground cracked.
<br><br>Guo Shijie fell to the point that his hundred bones wanted to break ...... sharp pain came to him, but he was still grateful ......
<br><br>He panted heavily, trembling and kneeling up, saying a word and spitting a mouthful of blood, "Sovereign understand, subordinate, subordinate in no way made, murdered the outer sect elders and peak master ...... in no way made such a rebellious thing ......"
<br><br>He is now extremely serious internal injuries, even to speak need to consume their own cultivation, to be able to say.
<br><br>If he did not heal, in this state, he would not survive more than three days ......
<br><br>Sima Zhen stared at Guo Shijie shadily.
<br><br>His eyes drifted.
<br><br>After ascending to immortality from the mortal world ten life martial emperor, all have to enter the robbery. Since then, they are subservient to the heavenly path.
<br><br>Immortals do not make vows at will.
<br><br>As long as the oath is made, there will be a heavenly dao judgment.
<br><br>"You better not have done it." Sikong Zhen said in a deep voice.
<br><br>Then he turned his head to Liu Yan and the others, "What do you think?"
<br><br>Even if Liu Yan and the others did not want to let Guo Shijie go, but seeing that Guo Shijie had made a Heavenly Dao oath, it was no good to pursue the matter.
<br><br>Anyway, now Guo Shijie's injury is not dead or half a life.
<br><br>This walk in Hades like a serious injury, than they are by the heavenly spirit tantalizing backlash injury, much heavier!
<br><br>Liu Yan and the others responded, "It's up to the Sovereign to decide."
<br><br>"Then this matter will be closed. No one is allowed to mention it again." Sima Zhen said, looking back at Guo Shijie, who was lying on his knees in the main hall like a dead dog.
<br><br>"You also take care of yourself."
<br><br>"Yes......" Guo Shijie's voice trembled, his whole body could barely hold up, prostrating on the ground, panting heavily with all his might.
<br><br>"Tomorrow is the big competition, go back and prepare yourselves."
<br><br>"Yes." Liu Yan answered and led the elders to retreat.
<br><br>Guo Shijie, on the other hand, was carried out by his subordinates' men.
<br><br>When he returned to the Sun and Moon Peak, Guo Shijie's eyes were practically tearing up.
<br><br>What kind of sins had he created?
<br><br>Seeing the outer door secret realm is about to reach the hands, but damn dry up.
<br><br>It's not just that it dried up, but also took in a heavenly spirit tantalizing, and finally misunderstood by the patriarch.
<br><br>Really damned a stomach of grievances did not give out.
<br><br>But aggravation is aggravation, he is not a moment dare not delay, immediately ordered, "I want to immediately close the healing, the other matters, all by the hundred Jing responsible."
<br><br>He struggled to lift a breath and hurriedly ordered what was to come.
<br><br>Saying that, he looked to his own personal disciple, now also one of the elders of Sun Moon Peak, Bai Jing, "I can't go to the opening of the disciple trial, everything you keep an eye on."
<br><br>"Nothing shall come to disturb me!"
<br><br>"Listen up, anything!"
<br><br>Hundred Jing answered.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>In a flash, the Sun Moon Sect Outer Sect Disciple Trials Conference officially opened.
<br><br>In the large square of the outer gate, an elder stood on the high platform and announced the rules.
<br><br>And below, there were densely packed people.
<br><br>"Outer Sect Disciple Trial Assembly, the participants are the three peaks of the outer sect."
<br><br>"All participating disciples will be transported into the trial space, and each person will be randomly transported to a different location."
<br><br>"In the trial space, there are countless demonic beasts. Everyone, the rank of the demonic beasts hunted at the end of the competition, as well as the number of demonic beasts, will be used to judge the rank."
<br><br>"The top ten disciples with the most peaks will be the winners. In addition, the disciple who achieves the top three in the Disciple Trial Assembly has an additional supreme reward."
<br><br>"In addition to being able to pick a middle-ranked immortal technique from the Immortal Technique Pavilion, they can also be accepted as a personal disciple by the inner sect elders."
<br><br>As the words fell, the following stirred up.
<br><br>There was an endless amount of noise and excitement.
<br><br>Intermediate Immortal Techniques were rare and coveted by all the disciples of the three outer sect peaks.
<br><br>But the most sensational thing is to be accepted as a personal disciple by the inner sect elders!
<br><br>You know, no matter how powerful the three outer sect peaks are, they are only the outer sect of the Sun Moon Sect.
<br><br>But the inner sect, it is not a class at all.
<br><br>If you can be accepted as a personal disciple by the inner sect elders, that is really a limitless future!
<br><br>Such a reward makes the disciples, sensation is also reasonable. The announcing elder also paused to wait for them to buzz for a while.
<br><br>Only then did he open his mouth and continue, "Entering it, each person will get a jade slip. If you encounter danger, you can crush the jade slip and be able to teleport out."
<br><br>"Of course, if you encounter a great danger, too late to teleport out of the situation also exists."
<br><br>"So all of you, must be careful to protect their own safety."
<br><br>After saying that, a huge void screen appeared out of thin air behind the elder.
<br><br>On the curtain, is the number of disciples and demon pills corresponding to each jade brief.
<br><br>The number of demon pills on it is 0. After entering, the number of demon pills on the curtain has changed and will be distributed according to the ranking at all times.
<br><br>Liu Yan and the Star Peak elders listened to the situation below and looked back at the Sun and Moon Peak people.
<br><br>Sure enough, Guo Shijie did not appear.
<br><br>Liu Yan sneered and spoke to the disciples around him, "This time, you must fight and overpower Sun and Moon Peak."
<br><br>"Remember, your peak master, will always keep an eye on you."
<br><br>The Sun Moon Peak side naturally also heard Liu Yan's words, and their faces were indignant.
<br><br>At this moment it was Bai Jing who led the Sun Moon Peak crowd, he "bah", turned back to his own people, "Although the peak master is not here, the elders and I will always keep an eye on you guys."
<br><br>"Your strength is the strongest among the three peaks, if possible, not only to take the top three, the best is to take the top ten!"
<br><br>"Let the other wastes, take a good look at their own strength!"
<br><br>"Otherwise what the heck would dare to talk big and try to overpower my Sun Moon Peak."
<br><br>"And." Bai Jing said, looked at the Star Peak side, his voice lowered, "Although the peak master is not here, but his previous instructions, you guys should never forget."
<br><br>Although the peak master Guo now closed, but closed before but with all the disciples have instructed, force to suppress the star peak!
<br><br>Also, see Yi Feng was, kill to kill.
<br><br>"What to do, got it?"
<br><br>Sun and Moon Peak people have answered, eyes ruthlessly look at the Star Peak side.
<br><br>This side is still talking, the clan elders above have already finished the rules.
<br><br>"The outer disciples' trial meeting, officially begins."
<br><br>As the words fell, a jade slip floated in front of all the disciples.
<br><br>Each grabbed the jade slip and disappeared in place in an instant.
