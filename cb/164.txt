 It's no big deal!
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people smashed their mouths in unison.
<br><br>Two great demon sect experts, an existence that could destroy a city, were actually no big deal in Mr.'s eyes.
<br><br>I'm afraid that this is something that only Mr. can say!
<br><br>I think, they are weaker than these two demon clans, but now they are able to talk to Mr. equal, and work for Mr., it is really a great blessing, a blessing cultivated in the last life!
<br><br>And at that moment.
<br><br>The wind was blowing in the sky.
<br><br>Rain, too, began to fall in drips.
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched out his palm, looked at the raindrops on his palm, and muttered, "It's really raining."
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, a large black umbrella fell from the sky and just landed in Yi Feng's hand.
<br><br>"Huh?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Where did the big black umbrella come from?"
<br><br>Seeing this big umbrella, Yi Feng was puzzled and took a look around, and there was no one there.
<br><br>I'm afraid it's the wind blowing, right?
<br><br>Yi Feng thought of this, lamenting his own luck is really good ah, he just lack of umbrellas, it scraped a big black umbrella, which also saves him to go to buy when the time comes.
<br><br>Can't help but, he smiled and teased towards Wu Yonghong and others, "See, I told you, an umbrella only, it will always come when needed."
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong and the three of them were shocked.
<br><br>Thinking about the meaningful words of Mr., they realized the meaning.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>When the two demon clans had not yet come, sir already knew what was going to happen next.
<br><br>This kind of means of detecting heavenly opportunities really made them feel amazed!
<br><br>"It's raining, let's go in and sit in the martial school first!" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and the others were busy agreeing.
<br><br>Several people held umbrellas and walked towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>Just two steps away, but found Lu Dasheng standing by the dung pit, looking at them expectantly, and in his eyes, with a vague sense of aggression.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng wanted to call him to come in together, but looking at him covered in shit, he finally held back.
<br><br>Hesitating for a moment, he took out ten gold coins from his arms and covered his nose and walked towards him.
<br><br>Seeing this, Rudason's gaze became agitated.
<br><br>"You, it's better to get wet here!" Yi Feng said embarrassingly, while extending his palm, "This is compensation for you."
<br><br>"Compensation?"
<br><br>Hearing these two words, Rudaseng nodded his head excitedly, then under his expectant gaze, Yi Feng put ten gold coins into his hand.
<br><br>This?
<br><br>Seeing these ten gold coins, Lu Dasheng was about to cry, his face was as wonderful as it could be.
<br><br>Not the agreed compensation, how only ten gold coins.
<br><br>Why is it that what is given to others is a holy product, but when it comes to him it is a bucket of dung, gold coins?
<br><br>Just as he was grieving, Yi Feng seemed to see what he was thinking, and could not help but frown.
<br><br>Although he has money, but ten gold coins compensation is really quite a lot, this hobgoblin is really a bit greedy snake swallowing elephant ah, the voice became less polite, asked: "What, have any comments?"
<br><br>This question.
<br><br>Let Lu Dasheng will mouth inside the words, swallowed hard back.
<br><br>Thinking about the horror of this one just now, where he still dares to have any opinion, can only face aggrieved nod and agree.
<br><br>Rain.
<br><br>Gradually fell heavier.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng's face, hung with water splashes, and do not know whether it is entirely rain, or mixed with tears.
<br><br>Heaven-devouring demon wolf tribe.
<br><br>In the Red Sun lineage, with Ao Bi Fang as the leader and other people sitting in the lobby, gloomy face, not saying half a word.
<br><br>Atmosphere.
<br><br>It was very depressing.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng is because of her physique, cultivating special techniques, so she can break through so fast, and as long as she reaches the realm of Demon Sect, then she is ironically the next heir of the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>But with the completion of the Bi is not.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng equivalent to the loss of the previous advantage, even if the secret realm opened, it is not necessarily able to break through to the Demon Sect.
<br><br>Ao Qing this time.
<br><br>It can be said that their countless years of hard work, turned into nothing.
<br><br>In addition to the wall in the Devouring Heaven Emperor, so they can only wait for news from the two demon sects of Xiu Luo, hoping to successfully capture Ao Qing back.
<br><br>Then force Ao Qing to give in, let him admit to himself in front of the whole clan that he had violated Ao Qingcheng, so as to use the pressure of public opinion to bring great influence to the royal lineage, forcing the Heaven Devouring Emperor to give them an explanation, or even directly surrender the throne of the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>This is the only means they, at present, can counter and may be effective!
<br><br>"Don't worry Lord Bi Fang, with the two demon clans, Shura Demon Clan and Fudao Demon Clan, it will definitely not be a problem to capture that punk Ao Qing." At this time, an old man said softly towards Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang nodded gloomily.
<br><br>He was not worried about this, after all, the two demon clans would not be able to take a small martial school.
<br><br>At this moment, a subordinate rushed in while shouting in panic, "Lord Bi Fang, it's not good, it's not good something big has happened."
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's gaze moved, a trace of bad premonition also appeared in his heart, palm a hand grabbed him, asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>A time, others have also looked at him.
