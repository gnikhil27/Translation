Figuring out the reason for all this.
<br><br>All the brothers and sisters are already stupid and can't wait to go out to the sect to make things happen.
<br><br>"And the master really has good intentions for us!"
<br><br>At this time, a disciple lamented, "Although I have been enlightened in the Hidden Scripture Pavilion and my cultivation has been increasing, I always feel that my mind has reached a bottleneck, and I have not been able to find the cause."
<br><br>"And now it seems that going out for a walk might be able to break this barrier!"
<br><br>"Yes, I have the same feeling."
<br><br>"It seems that the master is also deliberately reminded in this regard!"
<br><br>"Master's teaching of us is really unmatched!"
<br><br>"In that case, Master brothers let's go out quickly!"
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>After a simple packing, all the senior brothers started to leave the island one after another. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This group of senior brothers out of the mountain, many residents of the island is also looking at the eyes.
<br><br>"The sky of the Immortal River Continent, I'm afraid it's about to change!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Two old men playing chess under the tree watched intentionally and unintentionally while talking in a low voice.
<br><br>"Do you have descendants in the outside world?"
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"It is better to put a message back, do not accidentally provoke, or the group will be destroyed."
<br><br>"Yes, if you step on this kind of iron, I'm afraid that the heavens will not be able to protect you, thanks for the reminder!"
<br><br>An old man took out a jade slip and put out the news.
<br><br>Also at the same time he took out the jade slip, many people on the island were also putting out letters.
<br><br>The purpose was much the same.
<br><br>"Fifth senior sister what are you planning to do?"
<br><br>After all the senior brothers left the island and faced parting, many of them turned their eyes to Su Yun Yun.
<br><br>"Me?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun couldn't help but smile bitterly, "I would like to accompany Master and serve him, but seeing Master's serious appearance, if I don't go out and make a name for myself, I'm afraid Master will have to disown me as a disciple, so I'm going to look around first."
<br><br>"And you?"
<br><br>"I am the emperor of the Great Order Empire of the Lingxu Realm, originally had no idea about the throne, but thought about it if not half identity, indeed is not worthy to say that they are the disciple of the master, so first go back to mix a emperor as a!" The disciple who was ranked thirty-two said.
<br><br>"I also plan to do so, so for the time being, go back to the sect of the Lingxu Realm, first take a casual chief disciple as, and then take down the position of the sect, so that if the future master has a need, I can also be useful." Another disciple said.
<br><br>"The two senior disciples are very insightful."
<br><br>Li Tai Bai rode backwards on the green bull and said, "There are rumors that the master is playing a big game of chess, although the master has long been a daoist master, everything under control, but we as disciples still have to share his worries, we control some power under the hand, the future may also be able to help the master his old man to send some use."
<br><br>"Senior brother Tai Bai is right."
<br><br>"In that case, let's do our best to operate our forces and make a name for ourselves!"
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>"But remember, we senior brothers must keep in touch, and if any of us have anything to do, make sure to rush over at the first opportunity."
<br><br>"Yes, understood."
<br><br>The brothers and teachers answered, then turned into streams of light and spread out in all directions.
<br><br>"Finally, we got rid of this group of mongrels."
<br><br>Lying on the recliner, Yi Feng was in a thief good mood.
<br><br>Now the entire Heaven and Earth Sect except for the Qing Huan phase and the monk who sweeps the floor, only he, Zhong Qing, Wu Chang'an and Yun Wu are left.
<br><br>Expenses can be considered much smaller.
<br><br>The key is to get rid of this group of munchies, and will not affect the progress of the task.
<br><br>Simply beautiful.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>What makes Yi Feng most excited is that after this period of accumulation, the number of his disciples is already ninety-nine.
<br><br>What is the concept?
<br><br>He took one more disciple, and then he was able to cultivate.
<br><br>He will be able to become a heartfelt cultivator.
<br><br>So Yi Feng spent the whole day lying inside the Heaven and Earth Gate, waiting for the last disciple to come to his door.
<br><br>After all, the number of flyers sent out before was far more than the number of people who came to worship, so maybe someone with a flyer was already on their way now.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This wait, is three months.
<br><br>The number of his disciples remained at ninety-nine.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng sit up all of a sudden.
<br><br>He was about to become a cultivator, where could he let this last disciple get stuck?
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>With simple luggage, Yi Feng left the Heaven and Earth Sect with a few guys from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>He thought.
<br><br>After leaving the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>Always able to meet an ordinary qualified disciple.
<br><br>PS: I'm a waste, stuck in the text, is thinking, still owe everyone chapters, do not dare to speak.
