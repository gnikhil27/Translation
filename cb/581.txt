"Cultivate the One Thought Finger successfully in one night?"
<br><br>You Solo stared at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Yi Feng solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>"Impossible, such a thing is absolutely impossible!"
<br><br>You Duxing said categorically, "In the immortal world, not everyone can cultivate immortal techniques either, and besides being powerful, the most important thing about immortal techniques is that they are difficult to cultivate."
<br><br>"So don't underestimate the fact that the One Thought Finger is only a low-level immortal skill, but it is also very difficult to cultivate, so to cultivate the One Thought Finger to perfection in one night is simply a nightmare!"
<br><br>"Brother you say this is arbitrary, what if someone really succeeded in cultivating it?" Yi Feng said leisurely: "Just say it straight, in case there really is such a person, then such a person's talent, what level is considered?"
<br><br>"If according to you, someone has succeeded in cultivating the One Thought Finger in one night, then I'm afraid his cultivation talent is not simply super genius, but can only be described as the pride of heaven!" Yu Dexing said with a solemn face.
<br><br>"The pride of the heavens!"
<br><br>These four words fell on Yi Feng's ears and instantly made him drift. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The pride of heaven.
<br><br>These four words were so damn good.
<br><br>And it really fucking fit with him.
<br><br>"Thanks a lot senior brother."
<br><br>With a crooked mouth and a face full of smiles, Yi Feng thanked towards You Duxing and was ready to leave.
<br><br>"Senior brother."
<br><br>You Duxing called out to stop him.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Yi Feng turned back.
<br><br>"As your senior brother, I still need to remind you, cultivation or down-to-earth, do not be overly ambitious, this kind of unwarranted ideas or no longer have, if you are in the cultivation of a thought finger, do not understand the problem, you can always come to ask me, senior brother I will answer for you!" You alone admonished in a serious tone.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was drifting, raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>"Senior brother ah, your kindness I appreciate, but your worry is a bit too much, because your senior brother I well ......"
<br><br>"Is a pride of heaven!"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corners of his mouth and smiled.
<br><br>Seeing this, you alone line shook his head and laughed bitterly: "Senior brother or go to cultivate as soon as possible, do not make this kind of non-nutritious joke."
<br><br>However, just as he finished speaking, he saw that a tiny wisp of qi energy shot out from Yi Feng's finger.
<br><br>This one time, directly dumbfounded You Solo.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"One ......"
<br><br>"One Thought Finger?"
<br><br>"This is actually the One Thought Finger."
<br><br>You Duxing stared and staggered, his mouth shuddered out, his eyes were almost scared out.
<br><br>Although the One Thought Finger in front of him and the One Thought Finger he cultivated, the power caused by some of the wrong number, but as a cultivator of the One Thought Finger, he can clearly understand, this is indeed the One Thought Finger undoubtedly.
<br><br>And so casually issued, is bound to be cultivated to the great perfection realm.
<br><br>"Senior brother you, senior brother you how in the end did you do it?"
<br><br>You alone can't even sit down, almost bounced up from the ground, hands tightly grabbed Yi Feng's shoulders, voice almost feverishly asked.
<br><br>"Did you learn the One Thought Finger before and lie to me?"
<br><br>"No, no."
<br><br>"The One Thought Finger is a secret immortal technique of the Sun Moon Sect, it is impossible to learn it unless you are a disciple of the Sun Moon Sect, and you only entered the sect in the past two days, so it is impossible that you learned it before."
<br><br>"In other words, you did indeed learn the One Thought Finger only in the past two days!"
<br><br>He was trembling with excitement, while muttering to himself.
<br><br>It was hard to imagine how shocked he was in his heart.
<br><br>The Immortal Technique that he himself had been cultivating for three years, someone else had succeeded in cultivating it between one night ......
<br><br>"Tell me quickly, senior brother, how on earth did you do that?"
<br><br>He chattered and asked.
<br><br>"Senior brother, calm down, calm down."
<br><br>Yi Feng pressed his palm and said lightly, "You don't need to be so excited, this matter of cultivating the One Thought Finger is actually very simple, it only requires so much of a drop of talent."
<br><br>"A drop of talent?"
<br><br>You alone frowned.
<br><br>This is what people say?
<br><br>"Senior brother does not need to be too surprised, I believe you will be able to one day."
<br><br>Yi Feng patted You Duxing's shoulder in a serious tone, and then his finger was in the sky with a few more fierce fingers.
<br><br>"Just like this one thought finger, sooner or later you will rise up to the sky."
<br><br>Finished, under the dumbfounded gaze of You Dohang, Yi Feng smilingly left, not taking away a cloud.
<br><br>And the next few days, Yi Feng out in the Star Peak around, from time to time a finger towards the sky.
<br><br>Especially when the senior management of Star Peak was around, he was more energetic.
<br><br>After all, he is the pride of the sky ah.
<br><br>It is not easy to become a genius, where can not let people know.
<br><br>First mixed with a chief disciple, and then mixed with an elder as, and finally become the youngest sect leader of the sect.
<br><br>Wouldn't that be beautiful?
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You say that human immortal has successfully cultivated the One Thought Finger in one night?"
<br><br>At the top of Star Peak, Liu Yan listened to her subordinate's report and opened her red lips incredulously.
