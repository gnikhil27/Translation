Looking at the storage ring in her hand, Yun Yaoyao couldn't help but let out a bitter smile.
<br><br>This mortal.
<br><br>Really let her cry and laugh ah.
<br><br>Not to mention a million, just any of the things in the Yan Lao Demon storage ring, take out can not be a million gold coins.
<br><br>Just Yi Feng that thunderous gesture, even let her this Martial Emperor level cultivator, also ashamed of themselves.
<br><br>The fact is that the actual person who is the owner of the company's property is the only one who has the right to be the owner of the property.
<br><br>In retrospect, she, a martial emperor, is considered to be living on a pig.
<br><br>"By the way, although we cultivators no longer have cultivation, but body strength and combat experience are not mortals can defeat, how exactly did you just do it?" Yun Yaoyao could not help but ask the doubt in his heart.
<br><br>"This well ...... hehehe."
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and said with a smile, "I'm not talented, although I can't cultivate, but also a bit of fist and foot kung fu."
<br><br>"A little boxing and kicking kung fu?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao smashed her red lips.
<br><br>Still a bit incredulous.
<br><br>Even after practicing some fist and kick kung fu, it doesn't seem to be able to overturn Old Devil Yan ah.
<br><br>It is just the fact that Yi Feng has no cultivation, it can not be faked, even if Yi Feng really has cultivation she does not know, but it is impossible to retain under the descending dimensional pressure, so you can only think that Yi Feng's fist and foot kung fu can really be.
<br><br>Just let her have a hard to accept the fact is that since Yi Feng can a brick shoot Yan old devil, then at this moment she, too, will not be Yi Feng's opponent at all.
<br><br>That is to say.
<br><br>The current Yi Feng is again stronger than her.
<br><br>And she, once again, became a burden to Yi Feng, a mortal.
<br><br>It's just that having had what happened before, this time it wasn't so unacceptable.
<br><br>"What should I do next?"
<br><br>She inquired out towards Yi Feng, also unknowingly, taking Yi Feng as the lead.
<br><br>"Gotta figure out where this is first." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"If my guess is good, it should be among the immortal ruins." Yun Yaoyao frowned and said.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly startled and immediately asked, "I remember you said that this immortal left something bullish, so can't we go explore the treasure?"
<br><br>"You're thinking too much."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao could not help but white Yi Feng, said: "Under the immortal suppression, without cultivation we do not know if we can survive, and still want to take the treasure is undoubtedly whimsical, plus there will certainly be forbidden formations near the treasure, or protect the treasure demonic beasts and so on, so in this case to get the treasure is simply impossible."
<br><br>"So we'd better think of a way to get out as soon as possible!"
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng weighed the moving brick in his hand and took Yun Yaoyao with him to look for a way out.
<br><br>This walk.
<br><br>It was most of the day.
<br><br>"Who?"
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng looked at the passage in front of him and shouted out.
<br><br>Then, in the passage in front of him, three alert figures came out.
<br><br>One was youthful looking, holding a long Jian.
<br><br>The other were two old men.
<br><br>"Oh? It's actually Miss Yun."
<br><br>When the youth saw Yun Yoyo, he said in surprise.
<br><br>And Yun Yoyo was also quite surprised.
<br><br>The youth was Lone Wunian from the Eastern Victory Continent, a Sixth Life Martial Emperor with a long Jian that had few opponents.
<br><br>The other two old men were experts who had arrived from the Central Continent, just like Old Devil Yan, and were known as the Yin-Yang Twin Elders, one with a cultivation level of five lives and one with six lives.
<br><br>"How come you guys are together?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"After all, under this descending dimensional pressure, if you still walk alone, I'm afraid you will die a miserable death!" Lone Wunian laughed and said.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yun Yoyo nodded.
<br><br>This was true, indeed.
<br><br>"How about Miss Yun, since we ran into each other, why don't we partner up together, so that we can have a lookout and not be unable to deal with the danger when we run into it?" Lone Wunian said.
<br><br>"I'm not going to explore the treasure, I'm afraid it's a different path." Yun Yaoyao said.
<br><br>"Miss Yun is joking, we are also looking for a way out." Lone Wunian laughed: "After all, under this kind of descending dimensional suppression, if you want to take the treasure, you have to save your life first."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao nodded.
<br><br>It seems that everyone has a number.
<br><br>If the cultivation level is low perhaps will still put up a fight, but reached this cultivation level, but more cherish their lives, what treasures are not as important as their lives.
<br><br>"Then together?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian laughed.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>Yun Yoyao's face was covered with a dilemma, and looked his gaze towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>And this subtle scene of Yun Yaoyao was caught in the eyes of Lone Wunian.
<br><br>In his heart, he couldn't help but guess, what kind of person is this youth that actually made Yun Yoyo take him as his leader?
<br><br>"I wonder if this brother is?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian clasped his fist.
<br><br>"My name is Yi Feng."
<br><br>Yi Feng also clasped his fist similarly.
<br><br>"Yi Feng?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian searched his entire mind and couldn't find such an expert's name, plus everyone's cultivation had disappeared, so he couldn't see through Yi Feng's true cultivation either.
<br><br>"Then two, how about looking for a way out together?" Lone Wunian asked again.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao turned her gaze towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng finally nodded his head.
<br><br>Lone Wunian smiled lightly, and then a group of five people walked together in a group and started looking for a way out.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Slowly passed.
<br><br>It was half a month.
<br><br>But the five people in the maze, still did not find a way out.
<br><br>And because we have lost the cultivation, also temporarily lost the ability to open up, although still more powerful than ordinary people, but half a month down, the five people have become more and more emaciated and wretched.
<br><br>At the same time, with half a month's contact, Yi Feng also and the lonely Wu Nian a few people familiar with a lot.
<br><br>And they also knew Yi Feng's identity as a mortal.
<br><br>After knowing that Yi Feng was a mortal, Lone Wunian was fine, but the two Yin Yang old men stopped saying half a word to Yi Feng, with contempt in their eyes.
<br><br>"After going around for so many days, I didn't expect to come back to this place."
<br><br>At this time, a lost voice came from Lone Wunian who was walking in front.
<br><br>The crowd looked.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>This was exactly the place where the crowd had met before, and they didn't expect to be back here again.
<br><br>It was tantamount to saying that the majority of the month had gone in vain.
<br><br>In this situation, even if they were Martial Emperor experts, their minds suffered this great torture because they couldn't hold on for long without being able to open up the valley.
<br><br>And Yi Feng was flashing his gaze.
<br><br>After hesitating for a while, he came out and said, "Gentlemen, why don't you follow me, I might have a solution."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The crowd turned their gazes to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>But the two Yin Yang twin old men just snorted coldly from their noses, not taking Yi Feng's words to heart at all.
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng, you're just a mortal, we can't even go out, could it be that you still have some way out?" Lone Wunian also asked with a face full of suspicion.
<br><br>"I'm not sure if it's considered a solution, but it's better than walking blindly, so if you believe me, you can come with me, if you don't believe me, I'll go by myself."
<br><br>Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>Because here, not far from the hall where he last ate snakes, now if you go according to memory, there is a high degree of certainty to find back to that hall.
<br><br>And that hall seems unusual now that I think back on it.
<br><br>Because recently walked so many days, never seen the same hall, which can represent that hall is special, so Yi Feng guessed that hall may have a way to get out.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the crowd.
<br><br>No one said anything.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head and was about to leave alone when Yun Yaoyao, who was on the side, finally spoke up and said, "I'll go with you."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded towards Yun Yaoyao.
<br><br>"Miss Yun, you, or do not do this, this journey can encounter a lot of demonic beasts, although those demonic beasts are also suppressed cultivation, but if scattered, there is still a great crisis ah!" Lone Wunian said with an ugly face.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was slightly silent, then raised her head and said, "No, I still choose to believe him."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>She raised her head and looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Although this mortal was sometimes hateful, she had to admit that this mortal's body would always bring her a sense of security.
<br><br>It was quite ridiculous to say that although a Martial Emperor would feel a sense of security in the body of a mortal, that was the truth.
<br><br>"What about me?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian asked with an ugly face.
<br><br>"I suggest you come with us." Yun Yaoyao looked at Lone Wunian and hesitated for a moment before adding, "Trust me, my choice will not be wrong."
<br><br>Looking at Yun Yaoyao's solemn expression, Lone Wunian gritted his teeth and finally nodded his head.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>However, the two yin and yang old men snorted coldly, turned around and left.
<br><br>"Hey two old men, why don't we go together, it's better to take care of each other on the way!" Lone Wunian shouted.
<br><br>"A martial emperor would actually put his hopes on a mortal."
<br><br>"Don't you think it's ridiculous?"
<br><br>The Yin and Yang twin elders said disdainfully, "Anyway, the two of us brothers won't do so."
<br><br>PS: Wish you all a happy new year, success in your studies, good health, endless money to spend and love to talk about, hehehe.
