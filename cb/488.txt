"Actually not dead?"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong's gaze sank.
<br><br>It was simply too much of a surprise to him that a tiny Golden Immortal could withstand a slap from him and still not die.
<br><br>However, the more so, the more intense his killing intent became.
<br><br>Not to mention that Xiao Zhan disrupted all his planning, just because of this talent of Xiao Zhan, he did not dare to let Xiao Zhan live, the future of his Heavenly Spirit Sect will be difficult to sleep and eat.
<br><br>He stepped on the void with his paws and chased out.
<br><br>Another palm towards Xiao Zhan covered the past, obviously does not want to give Xiao Zhan half a chance to live.
<br><br>However, when he was about to hit Xiao Zhan, a jade hand suddenly appeared and hardened against Yin Tianxiong's palm.
<br><br>"So strong, who is it?"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong rolled several times in mid-air before he stabilized himself and turned his shocked gaze towards the front.
<br><br>Then he saw that in front of Xiao Zhan, a woman in white appeared. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Her aura was overwhelming and arrogant, and she was currently staring at him with ice-cold eyes.
<br><br>Noticing such a gaze, even with Yin Tianxiong's cultivation level, he did not dare to confront it.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong's voice was hoarse as he asked.
<br><br>"Heaven and Earth Sect, Su Yun Yun, also Xiao Zhan's senior sister!"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun's voice came out coldly, at this moment she had killing intent in her eyes, she never expected that the head of a sect would actually sneak attack her senior brother.
<br><br>Fortunately, Xiao Zhan was not seriously injured.
<br><br>Otherwise, the entire Heavenly Spirit Sect would not have been enough to bury him.
<br><br>"Heaven and Earth Sect?"
<br><br>"Senior sister?"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong carefully recalled, actually did not gather any information about the Heaven and Earth Sect, and even more so, did not know, from where did Xiao Zhan appear such a powerful senior sister.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Su Yunyun's face on the distant ring was even more dramatically changed.
<br><br>She did not expect at all that the woman she encountered that day in the Heavenly Star City was actually so powerful that she was able to be on par with her master.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>Recently, what exactly has he gone through?
<br><br>She clenched her teeth with a deadly grit, filled with resignation.
<br><br>"Tell me, why did you make a move against my senior brother?" Su Yunyun questioned icily.
<br><br>"Hmph."
<br><br>"He disregarded the rules and sneakily attacked my apprentice in the ring, my apprentice was simple-minded for a moment and failed to recognize his plot, and let him almost destroy his cultivation with a paper of repudiation."
<br><br>"If I hadn't been here, I would have almost let him muddle through."
<br><br>"Since he dares to act boldly in my Heavenly Spirit Sect's territory, then naturally I cannot keep him."
<br><br>A deep voice came from Yin Tianxiong.
<br><br>Today.
<br><br>He was to speak the dead into white.
<br><br>Because today's result, he could not accept, other than that, just the Third Prince there he could not account for.
<br><br>If you really let Xiao Zhan a letter of repudiation to Liu Ruyan to withdraw the marriage, then the third prince will not become a shoe picker?
<br><br>So.
<br><br>This initiative, too, must be in his hands.
<br><br>"All of you present, I think you must have seen the truth of the matter, since as a friend of my Heavenly Spirit Sect, you are also expected to bear witness for my Heavenly Spirit Sect, and also for me, Yin Tianxiong, I am taking this action because I have no choice but to do so." Yin Tianxiong will look at the whole field, said leisurely.
<br><br>He said this.
<br><br>It could be said that his words were extremely clever.
<br><br>It even carried an obvious threatening intention.
<br><br>So even though many people knew it in their hearts, they nodded and agreed.
<br><br>After all, to be able to sell a favor to the Heavenly Spirit Sect, why not do so.
<br><br>As for Xiao Zhan, although his talent is outstanding, but in front of the entire Heavenly Spirit Sect, what does it count.
<br><br>A genius who has not grown up is just a dry bone.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>These words fell on Xiao Zhan's ears, causing his forehead to ripple with veins and his body to tremble with anger.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun suddenly burst out laughing.
<br><br>"What a good sneak attack, what a muddle ......"
<br><br>An icy cold voice came out while gently helping Xiao Zhan up behind her.
<br><br>"Senior brother."
<br><br>"You and here have a good chat about your injuries, next, your senior brother and sister to back you up."
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong's pupils shrank.
<br><br>"Backing up, can you back up?"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong questioned in a cold voice.
<br><br>Although Su Yun Yun made him somewhat scornful, but that was all.
<br><br>A Xuan Xian, in the main dojo of his Heavenly Spirit Sect, could she still make big waves?
<br><br>"Try it and you'll see."
<br><br>The corner of Su Yun Yun's mouth lifted as he leisurely shouted, "Eighteenth senior brother, today, you should be able to enjoy yourself."
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, a cloaked figure swept by like a stream of light in the center of the square.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"Senior sister, where is the need for you to say more, I have already killed up long ago."
<br><br>As the voice fell, Hong Crazy grabbed two Heavenly Spirit Sect's Heavenly Immortals with both hands and squeezed them in his hands, then slammed them hard together.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The two people were crushed under the tremendous force, and their flesh and blood burst hard, spilling blood and flesh all over him.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"Cool!"
<br><br>He roared loudly and charged towards the other Heavenly Spirit Sect people again.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>Two more Earth Immortals had their heads broken off by him hard.
<br><br>"Woo hoo, cool cool cool."
<br><br>Under the crazy sound, everywhere he passed, there were mutilated limbs and broken legs.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong looked at him with a face full of anger.
<br><br>Although the Heavenly Spirit Sect had a large family, but at least these people were considered to be the middle battle force, this instantly lost so many, how could he endure this.
<br><br>"Enforcement Hall, listen to my order, surround and suppress him!"
<br><br>Rolling orders came out from Yin Tianxiong's mouth.
<br><br>As soon as his order fell, hundreds of uniformly dressed black-clothed people swept up in the air, attacking from all directions surging together and rushing towards Hong madly.
<br><br>And each of these black-clothed people are imposing gallantly, and each of them has the strength of the Heavenly Immortal, and the powerful ones even touched the threshold of the Golden Immortal.
<br><br>"This Heavenly Spirit Sect is worthy of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, really strong heritage, ah, just the enforcement hall, I'm afraid it can sweep half of the Southern Domain."
<br><br>"Yes, under the siege of the Law Enforcement Hall, I'm afraid this madman won't be able to bounce around for long."
<br><br>The crowd of spectators looked up at the sky and could not help but make speculative sounds.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What they didn't expect was that Hong Crazy, facing the siege of hundreds of people, was actually charging towards them instead of retreating.
<br><br>At the same time, there was an even more excited smile on his face.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, so many people, it's really cool."
<br><br>"You, Master Hong, I can't control it anymore."
<br><br>"Art is explosion, drink!"
<br><br>A roaring voice came out, and Hong's crazy body steeply expanded and directly exploded itself in mid-air.
