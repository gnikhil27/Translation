"What have you been doing?"
<br><br>Looking at Jian Hengtian who suddenly appeared again, the other three asked towards him.
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian licked his lips vainly and said heartily, "Uh, huh, just now my stomach was not feeling well and I took a shit in the back."
<br><br>These words immediately ushered in the blank stares of the crowd.
<br><br>At least he was a Martial Emperor cultivator, but he actually had to take a shit?
<br><br>The patriarch of Taiyi Valley, as the only female within it, even subconsciously slapped her palm and took a few steps away from Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>But they did not pursue, all their minds are in front of the Yi Feng body.
<br><br>Seeing this, Jian Hengtian flashed his small eyes and smiled smugly.
<br><br>If these three goods know that the scraps of leftover soup contains so much energy, will not be on the spot to beat him out of what he ate?
<br><br>However. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just when Jian Hengtian thought he could conceal it from the world, he suddenly froze in place with a startled footstep.
<br><br>"Not good, the cultivation can't be suppressed, it's going to break through."
<br><br>He cursed in his heart, the cultivation as well as Yuan Qi on his body was already unable to resist bubbling up from his body.
<br><br>This scene immediately attracted the attention of the remaining three people.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian you, you're going to break through?"
<br><br>The three people asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Which ...... which has, just accidentally exposed some outside."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian face full of embarrassment, in order to suppress the cultivation is up red face, swallowed and stammered to respond.
<br><br>"And say no, when we are stupid?" Taiyi Valley Patriarch Liu Gu Yi said with a cold face.
<br><br>"That is, this is clearly a sign that the realm has reached a critical point and is about to break through." Canghai Mountain Patriarch Li Canghai also had a million disbelief on his face.
<br><br>"Say, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch Yun Tianlong shouted in a deep voice: "Although the four of us are all Seventh Life Martial Emperors, but all along your cultivation level is a cut below ours, but we still need at least a few decades of cultivation to reach the Eight Life Martial Emperors, why is it that you have broken through before us?"
<br><br>"Yes, tell me quickly, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Is there something you're hiding from us?"
<br><br>The three men looked straight at Jian Hengtian, their voices full of questioning.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Oh, I ......"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's forehead was sweating, being stared at by the three people, and his small hands had nowhere to put them.
<br><br>"Say, have you been hiding your clumsiness, in fact, your cultivation originally higher than us?"
<br><br>Just when Jian Hengtian was stammering and didn't know what to do, Li Canghai's questioning voice came out again.
<br><br>This instantly reminded Jian Hengtian, he hurriedly snorted and laughed, "Aiya Aiya, I didn't expect you guys to see it!"
<br><br>"All right, in that case, I'll show my cards ......"
<br><br>"In fact, I have already obtained the inheritance of the founding sword emperor of my Hengtian Sword Fast, so my cultivation level has long surpassed yours." Jian Hengtian pretended to say proudly, "I just haven't told you guys about it."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You actually obtained the Sword Emperor's inheritance?"
<br><br>At these words, the three people immediately looked at Jian Hengtian incredulously.
<br><br>"I can't believe it, Jian Hengtian, you're hiding it deep!"
<br><br>"That's right, if you hadn't been unable to suppress your cultivation before we saw it, we would really have been fooled by you."
<br><br>"Yes, you old boy, unkind ah, always thought you were the weakest of the four of us, did not expect you are the strongest."
<br><br>The four people have emitted the sound of admiration.
<br><br>Although the opening sword emperor of Hengtian Jianzhai is only a ten life martial emperor cultivation, not much higher than the seven life of their realm, but those who know the history have to admit that this person is indeed a character.
<br><br>So there was no doubt that Jian Hengtian had gotten his inheritance and broken through the realm.
<br><br>"Keep a low profile, keep a low profile."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian pressed his palm, a heated smile on his face.
<br><br>In fact, after so many years, his Hengtian Jianzhai that master ancestor bones have turned to dust, where there is any ghost heritage?
<br><br>But the three believe it is good, is considered to have passed a disaster.
<br><br>"But you can't break through now, the movement of your breakthrough in case it disturbs that senior in front of you, that would be bad." At this time, Liu Gu Yi said.
<br><br>"Then how is it good?"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"It's just that we are all grasshoppers on the same rope now, one glory, one loss, the three of us together to help you suppress it first!" Liu Gu Yi had to say so.
<br><br>The others also have no problem with this.
<br><br>Soon, the three of them worked together to suppress Jian Hengtian's overflowing cultivation for the time being.
<br><br>Half a day later.
<br><br>The four people through the thin mist behind Yi Feng has not yet dissipated clean, vaguely see the gradually open sky, eyes suddenly bright.
<br><br>"Soon we will leave the valley."
<br><br>"After leaving the valley there is no more poisonous fog, so we should be able to catch up with senior immediately."
<br><br>"It's a great fortune to be able to befriend such a person!"
<br><br>"I don't know what that senior looks like!"
<br><br>"Who knows, this poisonous fog not only obscures our vision, but also completely shields our perception, although we can hazily see his back, but we can't see what he looks like at all."
<br><br>"Whatever he looks like, it's not something we can mess with, just give him a good impression first."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian straightened his body while straightening his clothes with both hands, and immediately put on a straight appearance.
<br><br>Compared to the others, he was more eager to see Yi Feng.
<br><br>After all, he who had eaten the leftover scraps, understood more than the three how powerful this one's methods were!
