He is merely a human immortal ah.
<br><br>Just have the forced gas to be gone.
<br><br>Yi Feng apprehension at the same time, thought of the previous Gong Chen after all made an oath of allegiance to himself.
<br><br>Even because of his own suspicions almost scrapped himself.
<br><br>Although the feeling of pretending to be called the Lord makes him very satisfied. But after thinking about it, it's better to confess.
<br><br>Confess the fact that his cultivation is very low.
<br><br>Anyway, they have made a vow, even if they are really just a human immortal, they should continue to follow them.
<br><br>Just not so respectful.
<br><br>The high-sounding name and respect should not be there either.
<br><br>"Look at my cultivation level, can I fight against Guo Shijie?" Yi Feng asked, saying that, he sighed. Somewhat helplessly silent.
<br><br>Being held in the sky, a mouthful of Lord, he really has some difficulty in saying the fact that he is a rookie. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In Yi Feng silent at the same time, Gong Chen's mind is a lot of thoughts flashed.
<br><br>Could it be that the Lord is not convenient?
<br><br>Why let himself see if he can make a move?
<br><br>Is it to test him?
<br><br>Test what?
<br><br>Could it be his own eyesight?
<br><br>Si lining in an instant, Gong Chen opened his mouth, "subordinates can not see the Lord's cultivation, such only two cases. Either it is so powerful that the subordinate can not see, or it is ...... in the immortal world equivalent to mortal human immortals."
<br><br>Yi Feng listened with a raised eyebrow.
<br><br>Sure enough, he still guessed it.
<br><br>"Of course, the master million can not be a human immortal! So it can only be that the subordinate can not see the cultivation of the master!" Gong Chen bowed his head and said, "My subordinate is ashamed."
<br><br>Harm, there can be such an explanation?
<br><br>Haha, Yi Feng almost laughed out loud.
<br><br>This explanation was the perfect solution to his troubles!
<br><br>"Ahem." He covered his mouth and cleared his throat in a pretentious manner, "That's right."
<br><br>"A mere Ninth Turn Xuan Xian is not worthy of my hands." Yi Feng spoke in a slow voice, with a profound look.
<br><br>Reasonable.
<br><br>Gong Chen agreed in his heart, a mere ninth-transformation Xuan Xian immortal was indeed not yet worthy of the Lord's hands.
<br><br>So this time, the Lord brought him out, probably to let him do some trivial things that were not worthy of the Lord's personal hands.
<br><br>But ...... another contradictory thought popped up in Gong Chen's head.
<br><br>The Lord is so powerful, why not just collect a reincarnation realm or even more powerful people outside to use?
<br><br>Wouldn't that be much more convenient, and why go back and forth in Shadow Island?
<br><br>Gong Chen asked this question out.
<br><br>Then added the question, "Why does the Lord only recruit people on Dark Shadow Island?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes jumped as he listened.
<br><br>This ...... this silly question ...... he such a three-legged cat scraps except in the Dark Shadow Island to fool around with you guys who can not use cultivation, where have the guts to fool other big guys outside?
<br><br>The people can slap themselves into a meat cake with one palm!
<br><br>He just has a problem with his spiritual roots, not a brain problem.
<br><br>To put it bluntly, if these people hadn't met themselves on Shadow Island, they would have met them outside.
<br><br>Surely they would not have sworn to follow themselves.
<br><br>Of course, this must not be said to Gong Chen.
<br><br>"Currently I will only take people from Dark Shadow Island." He said back.
<br><br>"Why?" Gong Chen asked again.
<br><br>"The heavenly opportunity ......" Yi Feng slowly opened his mouth, slowly shook his head and said in a secretive manner, "It must not be revealed."
<br><br>Ah this ...... Gong Chen some choke.
<br><br>The next moment, he realized what, immediately shut his mouth tightly, not daring to pursue the question.
<br><br>The Lord said that the heavenly opportunity ......
<br><br>Immortal world said the heavenly opportunity, are not the real heavenly opportunity. But the individual's qi luck or fate calamity.
<br><br>Or maybe the direction of a continent or even the entire immortal world.
<br><br>The powerful people in the immortal world will use the celestial disk to project.
<br><br>More powerful, will be surging with the astrological disk projection. For example, the Immortal Hall group of old monsters.
<br><br>And the real heavenly opportunity, no one can calculate.
<br><br>The Lord said that the heavenly opportunity ...... that must not be the kind in the ordinary sense of the immortal world.
<br><br>It seems that the protagonist is planning something monstrous! Such and such to be worthy of such careful treatment by the Lord.
<br><br>What could it be?
<br><br>Gong Chen pondered in silence.
<br><br>"Alright. You go back first." Gong Chen was still pondering when he heard Yi Feng's words, "Find a place to avoid people and wait for my command."
<br><br>"I will notify you with a jade slip at that time."
<br><br>"Yes." Gong Chen answered and retreated.
<br><br>But Gong Chen's heart was in a mess when he left.
<br><br>In his mind, he was still thinking about Fang Feng's words.
<br><br>The Lord said that only people from Dark Shadow Island ...... are accepted and Dark Shadow Island, the most dangerous place of exile in the Immortal World.
<br><br>Equivalent to death row, no one can get out.
<br><br>That is, those who can be in Dark Shadow Island are all heavy criminals in the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Can exile people to the Dark Shadow Island ...... Gong Chen fiercely stopped in his tracks.
<br><br>It is the Immortal Hall of Heaven!
<br><br>Could it be that ...... Gong Chen was shocked by an idea that popped up in his mind.
<br><br>Could it be that the Lord's plot has something to do with the Heaven's Immortal Hall?
<br><br>It must be.
<br><br>Gong Chen was somewhat appalled, and then thought of the Lord's strength and slowly settled down.
<br><br>The Immortal Hall group of old guys he had met a few, indeed powerful.
<br><br>But compared to the Lord, or a big difference.
<br><br>Regardless of what the Lord is planning for the Immortal Palace, even if he wants to take out the Immortal Palace, Gong Chen also feels that there is nothing impossible.
<br><br>If you really want to kill the immortal temple to set up their own new immortal temple control the immortal world ...... hey hey hey ......
<br><br>That their own Lord's closest subordinate, the worst is also an elder.
<br><br>Immortal temple elders, Gong Chen just think about all feel beautiful.
<br><br>It is very pleasant.
<br><br>On the other hand, Yi Feng, who returned to his residence, thought about arranging for Gong Chen to get rid of Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Although Guo Shijie is only a ninth turn Xuan Xian.
<br><br>But the Sun Moon Sect must have a more powerful existence.
<br><br>If you let Gong Chen get rid of Guo Shijie rashly, when the time comes, if those more powerful people of the Sun Moon Sect find out, then you will also be implicated.
<br><br>It is better to be more cautious.
<br><br>Find a better opportunity, then let Gong Chen to get rid of Guo Shijie.
<br><br>This way you can also take out yourself.
<br><br>Sun Moon Sect, Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>At the same time when Yi Feng was planning to get rid of Guo Shijie, Guo Shijie was also thinking about getting rid of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"If this poisonous boy doesn't die, I can't be satisfied with my intention!" Guo Shijie spoke in the room with an indignant tone.
<br><br>"Does the peak master want to kill him? Disciple go." Guo Shijie's disciple next to him volunteered.
<br><br>Guo Shijie raised his hand and stopped the disciple's words.
<br><br>"If it's really that easy to kill him, I myself can just kill him with my own hands." Guo Shijie said.
<br><br>"But I am the Sun Moon Peak Master, if it was a disciple under my own disciple it would be fine, just die, just put a random charge on him."
<br><br>"But he is a disciple of the Star Peak. As you can see, Liu Yan defended that poison boy a lot, and really treated him as a genius to protect."
<br><br>"My peak has always been at odds with Star Peak, and the patriarch has hammered me many times for this."
<br><br>"If the patriarch finds out that I killed a disciple of Star Peak, he will certainly not get around me."
<br><br>"So this matter, must only act in secret, must not be caught in the horse's foot."
<br><br>Guo Shijie said, looking at his disciple, "You are my disciple in charge, the patriarch and Liu Yan both know you. Also know your skills."
<br><br>"If you are allowed to go, it will be easy for people to find traces."
<br><br>"Then how about sending a new disciple who just joined?" The man asked.
<br><br>Guo Shijie nodded, "It's best not to be powerful, powerful ones are inviting to the eyes."
<br><br>"But not powerful ones, can they kill him?" The disciple asked hesitantly.
<br><br>"Humph." Guo Shijie hummed out of his nose, full of disdain.
<br><br>"He's just a lowest level Human Immortal, even if he cultivates the One Thought Finger. An Earth Immortal can easily kill him."
<br><br>When that disciple heard that, he said, "Yes. Then the disciple will go and arrange for an Earth Immortal to take care of it."
<br><br>"Go ahead." Guo Shijie said, "Get rid of it early, I don't want to see one more glimpse of that poison boy."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Yi Feng walked on the road and headed towards where Liu Yan was.
<br><br>He had finished practicing the One Thought Finger in one night, and now he wanted to go to the Immortal Technique Pavilion to find some other techniques to practice a few more.
<br><br>Unfortunately, the Sun Moon Sect's rule is that new disciples are eligible to choose a low-level immortal technique in the Immortal Technique Pavilion.
<br><br>There is only one.
<br><br>Now he can only go and talk to Liu Yan to see if he can get a few more books out of him for the sake of his awesome talent.
<br><br>The forest was quiet.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked alone on the path covered by the bamboo forest.
<br><br>Suddenly a few bamboos moved, a figure fell in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>The sharp-tongued, at first glance is not a good thing.
<br><br>Yi Feng wanted to go around him, but the person in front of him blocked the path.
<br><br>"A good dog doesn't block the way!" Yi Feng frowned and said warily.
<br><br>"No wonder I want to kill you. You owe this than mouth too." The sharp-tongued man said, and with a shake in his hand, a crystal sword appeared in his palm.
<br><br>When the sword shook, the killing machine appeared.
<br><br>"You want to kill me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a frown.
<br><br>"Good, I am here to kill you." The man spoke out coldly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart thudded.
<br><br>But he didn't panic, but said in a calm manner, "I'm a genius of Star Peak, do you really think you can kill me?"
<br><br>"Haha, genius, a human immortal genius, with my Earth Immortal perfect cultivation, killing you is like killing a chicken.
<br><br>The sharp-tongued man said, looking at Yi Feng mockingly, like a dead man.
<br><br>After saying that, the sword blade turned and stabbed at Yi Feng.
<br><br>The man did not move, sword qi swirled with powerful cultivation airflow has come to kill Yi Feng!
