They are none other than the four great patriarchs of the North Sea.
<br><br>They wanted to directly follow Yi Feng and talk to him, but there was a process for the poisonous fog to dissipate, so they always only dared to hang behind Yi Feng for more than a hundred feet.
<br><br>"The one just now stayed here for a long time."
<br><br>Heng Tian Jian Zhai patriarch said.
<br><br>"Indeed, I don't know what he is doing here."
<br><br>The Taiyi Valley Patriarch said with the same puzzlement.
<br><br>Just after she finished speaking, she realized that she had stepped on something and moved her paws away to see that she was frozen in place like an icicle.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This is an emperor level demonic beast, the Divine Hidden Snake?"
<br><br>She murmured and asked.
<br><br>At that, several people came over to take a look, and also immediately drew a breath of cold air. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Not bad, it is none other than the Divine Concealment Snake."
<br><br>"Don't look at this kind of snake body is not big, looks no different from ordinary small snake, but is really a real emperor level demonic beast, even the four of us encounter can't please!"
<br><br>Heng Tian Jian Zhai patriarch said in horror: "Only one snake head is left, it should be the one who just did it."
<br><br>"Quickly look at the ground."
<br><br>At this time, the Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch again came out with a voice of alarm.
<br><br>The crowd heard the voice and hurriedly went over to look, and immediately found a pile of leftover scraps on the ground as well as some soup.
<br><br>Even in the cold weather, it was still bubbling with the slightest temperature.
<br><br>"Wait, these meat, seems to be, seems to be divine hidden snake meat?"
<br><br>"And this mushroom, this mushroom seems to be ...... seems to be the Snow God mushroom?"
<br><br>"It seems to be really Snow God mushroom!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Actually, actually use the divine hidden snake plus snow god mushroom such a supreme treasure to make soup, what kind of divine handiwork is this?"
<br><br>Looking at the leftover scraps on the ground, the four people stared in awe, the shock in their hearts already didn't know what to use to describe.
<br><br>"If my guess is right, the heaven and earth vision born in the First Line Valley this time is precisely because of the birth of this Snow God mushroom."
<br><br>"It's just a pity that this heaven and earth extraordinary treasure has already been made into soup by that one just now."
<br><br>The face of the Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch was indescribably complicated.
<br><br>This is equivalent to saying that the treasure of this First Line Valley they are not able to fish again.
<br><br>But you say really by that high person to pick, they heart is not much, after all, the strong is respected.
<br><br>But such a treasure used to make soup, the rest was also poured on the ground, so wasteful behavior, it is really hard for them to accept!
<br><br>"Could it be that that person came in the First Line Valley just to come and eat this soup?" The Canghai Mountain Patriarch asked in the same complicated manner.
<br><br>"I don't think so, it's more like passing by this place, seeing this Snow God mushroom, and making a soup by hand."
<br><br>The Taiyi Valley Patriarch said with an ugly face.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The others couldn't help but skim their mouths, their hearts were hard to bear.
<br><br>I'm afraid, it's really true.
<br><br>"However, don't look at these leftover scraps, I'm afraid they are also a great tonic!"
<br><br>At this time, the Heng Tian Jian Zhai patriarch looked at the leftover scraps on the ground, licked his lips, and asked tentatively, "How about ......"
<br><br>These words immediately ushered in the blank stares of the other three.
<br><br>"Although there is no denying that these things are great tonic, but at least we are also the head of the four sects, what is the matter with picking up the leftover scraps of others?"
<br><br>"That is, even if that person is stronger, we are not reduced to eating what is left of him."
<br><br>"As the head of a family, the dignity that should be there is still needed."
<br><br>"Well, hurry up and follow that one, the treasure can't be fished, it's good to get to know people."
<br><br>The four resumed their journey and followed closely behind Yi Feng for a distance of more than a hundred feet.
<br><br>But just walking for a while, it was found that suddenly there was one person missing, the Hengtian Sword Fast Patriarch was missing.
<br><br>"Where is Jian Hengtian?"
<br><br>Taiyi Valley Patriarch couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"I don't know, it was there just now."
<br><br>The Canghai Mountain Patriarch was also filled with bewilderment.
<br><br>And not far behind, the Hengtian Sword Fast Patriarch Jian Hengtian quietly turned back to the remnants.
<br><br>"Dignity or whatever, it says so, but what if this thing is good to eat?"
<br><br>"Anyway, no one will see it."
<br><br>He quietly looked around, saw no one around, bent down and stretched out his tongue and licked it lightning fast.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>This bite directly made his body shake.
<br><br>It clearly felt like the power in his body was climbing up, even his talent and cultivation were improving.
<br><br>At this moment, his eyes glowed straight away.
<br><br>"Hahahaha."
<br><br>"It's simply a super tonic, these three big fools*, fortunately I am clear-eyed and can see at a glance the extraordinary nature of these residues ...... no, divine soup."
<br><br>He opened his mouth to laugh out loud, but remembered that the remaining three are not far away, he hastily covered his mouth to reveal a smug smile.
<br><br>Subsequently, with a swift movement, the residue left on the ground licked a clean.
