After kicking Peng Ying away, Yu Wujie directly ran away.
<br><br>He wanted to cry without tears.
<br><br>So ugly, what the hell is this!
<br><br>"Ah, help, help!"
<br><br>However, but no one heard the sound of help coming from Peng Ying, she just happened to be sucked into and a whirlpool in the water, just when someone drew attention to look over, Peng Ying had been completely sucked into the whirlpool and disappeared.
<br><br>After returning from the banks of the pure stream, Yi Feng had returned to the martial arts school, just walked into the backyard, found the dog lying on the ground trembling.
<br><br>And his fearful gaze just happened to be directed at the small door behind Yi Feng's recliner.
<br><br>"Wangcai, what's wrong with you lately?"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his head and said comfortingly.
<br><br>"Ow, ow."
<br><br>Ao Qing sent out a guttural cry to that school door. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"You can't be?"
<br><br>Yi Feng stared at the dog, this condition, very much like the rutting period of his hachis in the previous life, could it be thinking?
<br><br>The thought of this, Yi Feng is more and more like.
<br><br>"OK, some day there is time, I will help you solve this problem, but for the time being, you have to be condescended to."
<br><br>After comforting Ao Qing, Yi Feng got up and stretched, quite bored, after all, it's still early for dinner time too.
<br><br>"Disciple, I'm going to Yi Hong Yuan to fight the landlord with those pussies, help me watch the martial arts school ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said softly, is also remembered the Yi Hong Yuan those few ladies, it has been a long time to find them landlord, afternoon time, I think they also have no business, just find them to pass the time or good.
<br><br>"Yes, Master ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded obediently, and his mouth could not help but ask: "Right, Master, what is the landlord fighting for?"
<br><br>"Heh."
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his head and laughed: "You don't understand even after saying it."
<br><br>"Master, I think I understand, because I often pass by there when I help you with the wine, and often see those young ladies and those ......" Speaking of this, Zhong Qing became desperate to speak, and stammered for half a day before saying. "So master you go to Yi Hong Yuan landlord, can you bring me ah?"
<br><br>After saying that, his face was embarrassed, and his whole little face turned red.
<br><br>However, and full of expectation, more subconsciously licked his lips, eyes baba looking at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What do you know?" Yi Feng helplessly laughed.
<br><br>This playing cards in the whole world is the only one in his hand, or his homemade, that the Yi Hong Yuan a few pussy is also he taught, Zhong Qing has not even seen, and how will understand.
<br><br>"Master, I really know."
<br><br>Zhong Qing bird wanted to try.
<br><br>"You really do not understand, now the occasion ah, you still practice boxing, fighting landlord this ah, later I will teach you." Yi Feng patted his shoulder, softly reassured, and then leisurely walked out.
<br><br>"But I'm not young anymore!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his head in bewilderment, but Master didn't want him to go, so he could only secretly suppress that leap in his heart.
<br><br>"Ow, ow."
<br><br>In the courtyard, Ao Qing still to that small door to send out a burst of trembling sound.
<br><br>Shit can't stand it.
<br><br>Ao Qing an arrow step, lying to the front hall, he now would rather face the eighteen divine weapons, not far from facing the fear emanating from that small door.
<br><br>The hell knows what he, the master, hid inside again.
<br><br>Can't afford to mess with.
<br><br>I can hide.
<br><br>On the other hand, facing Yi Feng's dinner invitation, both Mao Yun'er and demon spirit child, are extraordinarily solemn treatment.
<br><br>Therefore, the first time demon spirit child used the jade brief to send a message to report what happened here to Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"Ling'er ah, I believe you, you must remember, tonight is a rare good opportunity, you must take him tonight even by any means, the future of Xuanwu Sect is entrusted to you!"
<br><br>The solemn message of Ning Xuanwu in the jade brief made Demon Ling'er feel a heavy feeling, and she nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Listening to Mao Yun'er's report, Mao Lin frowned in deep thought.
<br><br>Finally, after a long, long hesitation, he took out a jade bottle and set it in front of Mao Yun'er with a snap.
<br><br>"Yun'er, I hope you won't blame me."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Mao Lin let out a deep sigh.
<br><br>In the recent month, the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce had completely crushed his Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce because of the Supreme Treasure, so he was under the pressure of the entire chamber's top management, causing him to be unable to breathe.
<br><br>Now at this moment, he can only do whatever he can.
<br><br>Once he thought of this, he felt extremely regretful for what happened at the beginning, a moment of blindness, put himself in such a situation, and even had to use his girl.
<br><br>"So father what the hell is this?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er looked at the white jade bottle and bit her red lips tightly.
<br><br>"Spring Flower Scatter!"
<br><br>Mao Lin said with an ugly face.
<br><br>Hearing this, Mao Yun'er's pretty body trembled gently, although her pretty face was full of complexity and reluctance, but remembering that gentleman's appearance and talent, a hint of leap and expectation paradoxically appeared in her heart.
