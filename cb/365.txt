Fortunately, when Bone Ben Wei disliked their trash and did not bring them to the Heaven Eating Demon Wolf tribe, this gave them the opportunity to take advantage of it.
<br><br>The three demons made their move once they had finalized their ideas.
<br><br>The good thing is that although their cultivation is sealed and their movement is restricted here, but at least demon beasts have some means of self.
<br><br>Immediately.
<br><br>They sent out the fluctuation.
<br><br>Although they couldn't transmit specific information, they believed that Milk Leopard Li would come to them when she felt the fluctuation.
<br><br>While hurrying, Milk Leopard Li gave Bone Ben Wei a hammer on his shoulder.
<br><br>But in her heart, she was guilty of muttering.
<br><br>Would this one skeleton really feel good when hammered?
<br><br>Just then, she felt the call of the three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest.
<br><br>"Huh?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Didn't the three commanders already go to the Immortal World some time ago, how come they are here."
<br><br>The milk leopard Li's heart was full of doubts.
<br><br>And as much as she wanted to go to the three demons of the rhinoceros forest, she could not help herself right now.
<br><br>Just now when she wandered off a little slow hand, Skeleton Benway glared over, not to mention leaving to go to the Rhino Forest and the others.
<br><br>Besides, Milk Leopard Li herself didn't want to leave either.
<br><br>That black feather all kinds of flattery before putting into Bone Ben Wei's banner, she also had this give and take, and definitely did not want to miss it.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>She immediately came up with a solution.
<br><br>Since she couldn't go to them herself, why not let the three demons come to her and then join together under the banner of Bone Ben Wei and Yi Feng?
<br><br>The more I thought about it.
<br><br>The more urgent the heart is.
<br><br>To know that Bone Ben Wei alone can create immortals with his bare hands, and that Yi Feng, who broke the sky with one fist, is even more terrifying. Such big people, if you mix well with them, you can go to the top of your life.
<br><br>It is better to be happy alone than to be happy with the crowd.
<br><br>To pull the three great commanders together and put them under your command is the way to go!
<br><br>So.
<br><br>She immediately used the unique method of the Western Demon Forest to emit the fluctuation.
<br><br>And the fluctuations she emitted were continuous, in order for the three demons of the Rhino Forest to be able to pinpoint her location and be able to find her as soon as possible.
<br><br>"Aha!"
<br><br>"I can feel Milk Leopard Li's fluctuations, she is coming towards us."
<br><br>Distantly.
<br><br>The three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest suddenly emitted excited voices.
<br><br>"Yes big brother, I felt it too."
<br><br>Rhinoceros Miao was also feeling excited, so he also continued to emit fluctuations, so that Milk Leopard Li could know their precise location at any time.
<br><br>After the continuous fluctuations were emitted, the three demons could not wait.
<br><br>"Eh."
<br><br>"The three great commanders are not far ahead, they should be waiting for me right in front."
<br><br>Feeling the continued fluctuation of Rhino Miao and the others, Milk Leopard Li nodded secretly, and her heart grew more and more excited.
<br><br>When we meet up, we should be able to put in a good word in front of Bone Ben Wei by asking the three great commanders to contribute a little treasure!
<br><br>I'm excited to think about it.
<br><br>I'm sure the three leaders will be grateful to me if they know I brought them such a great opportunity.
<br><br>Nurse Pantheri can't wait to meet up, too.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei and his group, walking slowly on the plains, looking at the scenery while giving the milk dose science about gold and the benefits and the softness of the girls.
<br><br>Finally, after an hour, Milk Leopard Li and the three demons of the Rhino Forest were getting closer and closer.
<br><br>"Here it comes."
<br><br>"Milk Leopard Li is not far ahead."
<br><br>"Yes, we'll be able to be saved soon."
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest clenched their fists, their hearts leaping with excitement to the extreme.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>They were quite a bit filled with hot tears.
<br><br>This period of time for them was not at all a time for demons to live.
<br><br>Their cultivation was sealed, their dignity was trampled on, and they had to be said to be garbage.
<br><br>The good thing is.
<br><br>The days of being a prisoner are at an end.
<br><br>Freedom, too, beckoned to them.
<br><br>So the three expectant gazes, opened up at the same time, stared in the direction from which the milk leopard-li fluctuation came.
<br><br>At last.
<br><br>The figure of Milk Leopard Li appeared in their eyes, and the three demons immediately shouted out.
<br><br>"Leopard Li, here, we are here."
<br><br>PS: Recently, the work and rest has progressed a bit, and I promise you that I will start to slowly resume updating after I am busy with the New Year, and I thank you for your patience and tolerance, and I will not let you down.
