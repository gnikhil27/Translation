 A few people were talking cheerfully over here.
<br><br>They didn't even notice that people were coming around them.
<br><br>When several people reacted, five blue-clothed people had already surrounded the joking few.
<br><br>Seeing the visitors, the brothers, including Chunlai and Xiawang, all serious up.
<br><br>Only Yi Feng, looked at the five people standing around him in a good manner.
<br><br>"Who are you guys?"
<br><br>"It's the disciples of Sun Moon Peak!" Chunlai's face was grave, "And all of them are old disciples!"
<br><br>These people did not have good intentions at first glance.
<br><br>Chun Lai stood up, "You Sun Moon Peak are idle, you still have time to come to me to run here to stroll around?"
<br><br>"What for, to see the scenery?" Spring Lai while pretending to be calm, while the hand moved, ready to pass jade brief to call someone.
<br><br>But one of the men in blue grabbed a hand, and directly threw Chunlai out! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The leader of the blue-clothed man pointed at Yi Feng, "Our target today is him."
<br><br>"I warn the rest of you, this matter has nothing to do with you. If you want to live, behave and get out, or else we will settle this together with you."
<br><br>The man in blue spoke with an unquestionable aura.
<br><br>Next to him, Xia Wang also clenched his fists and whispered next to Yi Feng, "Senior Brother Yi you hurry and leave, these people are targeting you. They are all old disciples of the Sun and Moon Peak, and their cultivation level is all Earth Immortal perfection! And all have immortal skills, not to mention you, even we combined can not beat."
<br><br>"If you don't leave, you will definitely die!"
<br><br>Said, Xia Wang stood up, blocked in front of Yi Feng, "Go, we cover you!"
<br><br>Xia Wang said out, but the words with a trembling voice.
<br><br>The leader of the blue-clothed man looked at Xia Wang, who was trembling in his speech, and laughed, "Stop us? With a few of you trash?"
<br><br>He said, pointing to a few people in the seats, "You're a little too self-conscious!"
<br><br>"I warn you once more, if you don't leave, today will be the death anniversary of all of you!"
<br><br>Over there, Chunlai climbed up and looked at the people in front of him warily and fearfully.
<br><br>"We are all from Star Peak, if you come to kill someone, if it is known, it will definitely cause strife between the two peaks!"
<br><br>"Do you still need to say that?" The man in blue disdainfully said, "So what if there is strife? When did Sun and Moon Peak and Star Peak not have disputes?"
<br><br>"When did Sun and Moon Peak not overpower you?"
<br><br>"I'm not going to talk nonsense with you guys either. Since you guys aren't smart, then let's accompany him to die!" The man in blue said, giving a command.
<br><br>The four blue-clothed men next to him moved at the wind!
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, they changed their figures, and the entire forest was enveloped by a terrifying boundary.
<br><br>The leaves of the trees flew wildly, pieces like swords.
<br><br>Outside several brothers also instantly get up, hands have begun to form seals, to prepare to counterattack!
<br><br>Yi Feng has been holding a glass of wine, listening to the man in blue from time to time sip on the words, no pressure.
<br><br>Seeing this, he still chewed meat in his mouth, slowly got up and patted the dust on his body.
<br><br>"Don't be in a hurry."
<br><br>He spoke out and said to the leader of the men in blue.
<br><br>"Don't you guys want to kill me? I'll give you guys a chance."
<br><br>Hearing him say so, the two parties facing each other looked over.
<br><br>"If you kill me here and cause strife between the two peaks, when the time comes, your Sun and Moon Peak might sacrifice the five of you in order to calm this matter."
<br><br>"Earth Immortal, is the least shortage in this sect, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said, pulling out his teeth with a bamboo stick, "How about this, how about we go to the Life and Death Stage?"
<br><br>"By then not only can you kill me openly and honestly, but also keep you guys out of the way."
<br><br>The life and death stage, is the sect disciples to establish a life and death contract either you die or I die fighting place.
<br><br>As long as two people are on the stage of life and death, no one else in the sect can interfere.
<br><br>Even if one of them died, the rest of the sect can never take revenge.
<br><br>In other words, if Yi Feng and these people on the stage of life and death, even if Yi Feng died, they Star Peak must also swallow this mouth!
<br><br>Shall not look for the Sun Moon Peak matter!
<br><br>This ...... Xia Wang hurriedly blocked said, "No!"
<br><br>"Yi senior brother you hurry to run!" Xia Wang anxiously said, "on the life and death stage you will certainly die!"
<br><br>Yi Feng soothingly patted Xia Wang, "Brother Xia don't worry."
<br><br>He held his bladder and looked at the men in blue, "Killing me on the stage of life and death is fair and square, and you can also complete the task your peak master gave you by the way."
<br><br>The blue-clothed man in the lead looked at Yi Feng with some disbelief.
<br><br>Of course he knew the Life and Death Stage was better!
<br><br>That was on the stage, and no one could be asked for a crime if they killed Yi Feng.
<br><br>But he did not believe that this kid in front of him was so kind as to offer to rush to death on the stage of life and death.
<br><br>He wiped his neck, he did not run even if it, but also handed the knife?
<br><br>What kind of operation is this?
<br><br>The man in blue looked at Yi Feng cautiously. When the senior brother in the door gave him the task, it was mentioned that this kid has a lot of tricks.
<br><br>He had to be careful.
<br><br>"What kind of conspiracy do you have?" The man in blue asked.
<br><br>"Conspiracy? What kind of conspiracy can I have." Yi Feng spread both hands and looked at the man in blue with a smile, "But I just want all of you Sun Moon Peak to see with your own eyes your miserable deaths at my hands."
<br><br>"Better let your blood splatter on your Guo Shijie's face."
<br><br>"You!" The men in blue were angered wildly by Yi Feng's arrogant to the extreme look, "Arrogant little boy suffer death!"
<br><br>The leader of the blue-clothed man was about to make a move, but he was pulled by another blue-clothed man beside him.
<br><br>"Brother, wait!"
<br><br>The leader of the blue-clothed man turned his head to look at the person who pulled himself.
<br><br>"Let's go to the stage of life and death." The man said to the blue-clothed person in the lead, and then looked at Yi Feng, "We can also show the whole Star Peak people what happens when you mess with our Sun Moon Sect!"
<br><br>"Let them see with their own eyes the way to die for messing with the Sun Moon Sect!" He said, withdrawing his gaze to look at the blue-clothed man at the head of the group and fawned, "Let senior brother be the first to go on stage then, so that senior brother can not only give Sun Moon Peak prestige, but also let Peak Master Guo see with his own eyes how formidable senior brother looks when he takes care of this little bastard for him!"
<br><br>"Maybe when our peak master is happy, he will promote senior brother!"
<br><br>The blue-clothed man at the head of the group nodded and looked at him with satisfaction, "That makes sense. You are still smart."
<br><br>"When I soar to greatness, I will definitely not forget to promote you."
<br><br>After saying that, he looked at Yi Feng, "Little brat, let's go to the Life and Death Stage now."
<br><br>"Sure." Yi Feng answered daintily, he gently rubbed his index finger, "Since you are so eager to find death, don't live a moment longer."
<br><br>"Bastard!" The blue-clothed man at the head heard Yi Feng's arrogant words and gritted his teeth in anger, "I will not leave your body whole later!"
<br><br>"These words are for you too."
<br><br>Yi Feng calmly said, first step towards the stage of life and death.
<br><br>Damn it! The leader in blue was so angry that he gritted his teeth, and his head was burning with fire.
<br><br>He must make this son of a bitch regret being so arrogant!
<br><br>When the time comes, torture him to death, make him kneel down and admit his mistake, then let him die without a body!
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>The six people left before and after, and Xia Wang at the back helped up Chun and looked at Yi Feng's back and sighed in admiration.
<br><br>"Worthy of my senior brother Yi, knowing that you can't fight, you first find a way to slip out."
<br><br>"So that once you get out, you can find the senior brothers in the peak to solve this matter."
<br><br>"How clever!"
