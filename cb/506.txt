Unprecedented astrological power pervaded the space.
<br><br>The entire sky turned into an astrolabe.
<br><br>This degree of deduction, around the power of the world of extinction, the face is also becoming pale at a visible rate.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When he finished deducing with great effort, pills are knocked a dozen after, still not deduced.
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian how to die do not know.
<br><br>Black Africa five people why exit do not know.
<br><br>As for the whole big picture, there is not the slightest problem exists.
<br><br>"In the end, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Perishable trembled.
<br><br>For the first time, he felt so gloomy. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In this darkness, it was like there was a big hand that was controlling everything from behind.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>He extinguished the world is not this control of the whole?
<br><br>Now it was actually being manipulated by someone else against it.
<br><br>"Who the hell is doing this?"
<br><br>The face of the Exterminator was so gloomy that water could drip out.
<br><br>However, the entire Immortal River Continent, even if the strongest people of several eras passed through his mind, still could not find this person.
<br><br>The reason is that no one can have such strength, move his big picture and still not show the slightest foot.
<br><br>Even managed to evade his astrolabe deduction.
<br><br>"My lord, although the black non-five people are missing, but there is always a way to find back, but what about the one that is gone?" The masked man knelt on the ground and asked worriedly.
<br><br>"In that case, only you can personally go out."
<br><br>Exterminator pondered slightly and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Ah Lord, but I'm not a heaven-destined person!" The masked man said in surprise.
<br><br>"Then I'll find a way to make you a Heaven-destined person!" Exterminator shrank his eyebrows and said, "After all, someone must make up the number, and you have served me for many years, so it just happens to be a compensation I give you!"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The masked man's eyes lit up and he hurriedly knelt down to the ground, "Many thanks, my lord!"
<br><br>"However, you are not without a task." Perdition said again in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, just give the order."
<br><br>The masked man hurriedly said.
<br><br>"I will use the art of stealing the sky to shield all the aura from your body, not only to make you a heaven-determined person, but also to make you transformed, and to make everyone unable to calculate, the relationship between you and me." Perish the world said in a deep voice.
<br><br>The masked man's eyes lit up with surprise and said, "My lord, you mean?"
<br><br>"Good, I want you to figure out who that hand in the dark really is." The Exterminator said in a deep voice: "Since he wants to oppose me, he will definitely target the people of Heaven's Determination, and it will be easier for you to blend in and find the clues than for me to personally go out."
<br><br>"Understood!"
<br><br>The masked man knelt on the ground and nodded solemnly.
<br><br>"Well, about to be baptized!"
<br><br>Extermination voice sunk, palm, chaos within the gale, the power of the great dao diffuse, towards the masked man covered.
<br><br>Subsequently, covering the sky, thunder pillars stormed down, and fell on the masked man's body.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Like and the tribulation.
<br><br>After the baptism, when it is transformed.
<br><br>When the movement subsided, the masked man completely changed his aura, and the mask on his face disappeared, replaced by a young appearance.
<br><br>"Go on!"
<br><br>Perdition waved his hand.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The youth named himself Teng Xiyuan and walked out of the interior of the Chaos and arrived at the Chaos Hall, finally settling down at the blue immortal pillar where Fang Xiaotian was originally located.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Only then did Teng Xiyuan let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>But at the same time, the corner of the mouth also spilled a smear of blood.
<br><br>Obviously, using the technique of concealing Teng Xiyuan on top of Fang Xiaotian, the consumption on him and its great.
<br><br>But he had to do it.
<br><br>He felt that the hand behind the opposition to him, extremely powerful, even he extinguished the world is not able to take it lightly.
<br><br>If this person is not uncovered, I'm afraid his big picture will have greater variables.
<br><br>And with Teng Xi Yuan under this ace, to deal with that person, think necessary much easier.
<br><br>Thinking of this, the corners of the mouth of the exterminator raised, emitting an icy cold voice.
<br><br>"Against me, no matter what you are, will be bound to find you out!"
