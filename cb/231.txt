"What?"
<br><br>This scene caused the eyes of the crowd present to fall to the ground.
<br><br>Collectively, they were petrified in place.
<br><br>With just that lightly falling slashes, a dozen Demon Dignitaries were cut down just like that?
<br><br>What kind of terrifying strength is this?
<br><br>The scene in front of them simply shocked their scalps.
<br><br>"Master, there is a face growing inside this flower." Just then, Zhong Qing suddenly saw the plant with giant thorns and let out a voice of alarm.
<br><br>"It's really true!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the face, a burst of hair in his heart.
<br><br>"Disciple, give me the knife to use." Yi Feng extended his hand and said.
<br><br>"It's Master." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Zhong Qing obediently handed the knife to Yi Feng, and after receiving it, Yi Feng cut towards the plant without saying a word.
<br><br>The middle of the face immediately revealed a look of fear, before the rush to react, the whole plant with giant thorns was cut down to the ground by Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng guessed, this plant is likely to be the former life of the kind of cannibalistic flowers. This kind of thing, a little carelessness may harm people's lives, that's why he gave cut.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>But Li Shuhua and others saw the situation, the cool air in the mouth straight pumping.
<br><br>That little boy lightly cut down a dozen demon dwellers not to mention, this youth whom the little boy called his master, cut down Song Ke again with one slash?
<br><br>God!
<br><br>What the hell is wrong with this world?
<br><br>The three who killed Song Ke's doppelganger with a single stomp were still fresh in their minds, and here came two more equally terrifying ones!
<br><br>The crowd's minds were dumbfounded.
<br><br>This kind of impenetrable divine characters actually appeared frequently in such mountains.
<br><br>The key, they seemed to have no concern at all about getting Song Ke killed, it was completely like they casually solved it when they were passing by.
<br><br>After the solution, continue to immerse themselves in the world, what to do!
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>After a shock, the crowd wanted to get up to say hello and thank you, but these two also like the three before, has long since run out of sight.
<br><br>Life.
<br><br>Really big ah!
<br><br>The crowd looked at each other's eyes, actually escaped another disaster.
<br><br>"Heaven help my Royal Sword Sect and the Li family."
<br><br>Yang Tianyu said excitedly, "Song Ke's doppelganger was destroyed twice, his divine soul is bound to be traumatized, the time to break the saint must be greatly extended, and the most crucial thing is that all the demon dignitaries under him have been cut down by those two high ranking people just now, so now is a great time for us to retrieve the fragrance bag."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>A glow of hope shone in the crowd's eyes.
<br><br>They hurriedly began to adjust their breath in place, and with no unexpected disturbances, they quickly forced the toxins out of their bodies with their own cultivation.
<br><br>After taking some more pills to recover some of their injuries, a dozen martial dwellers rushed towards Song Ke's base camp.
<br><br>This time there were no surprises, and they soon arrived in the canyon.
<br><br>"The fragrance bag must be next to Song Ke's main body, let's hurry and dive over." Li Shuhua instructed.
<br><br>The crowd heard the words and pressed on towards Song Ke's main body in the dense bushes.
<br><br>"Disciple, this canyon below looks eerie, I'm afraid there will be a lot of beasts!"
<br><br>By the cliff, Yi Feng looked at the canyon below and said softly.
<br><br>"Master, let's go, I'm not afraid!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing tightened the big knife in his hand and said with excitement.
<br><br>"Worthy of being my good disciple."
<br><br>Yi Feng touched Zhong Qing's head and gave an appreciation, then he took his young apprentice towards the jungle-dense canyon ......
<br><br>"Look, the incense bag is right there."
<br><br>Stalking next to Song Ke's body, the group soon found the incense bag hanging on a certain branch of the body's acacia tree.
<br><br>"For our approaching, Song Ke did not notice, I'm afraid that the destruction of his two doppelgangers has affected him greatly, I'm afraid that he can't divide his mind to deal with us now, quickly go up and get the incense bag, then leave this place." Yang Tianyu commanded.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>Eyes on the incense bag, then ready to make a move.
<br><br>But at the next moment, the acacia tree in front of him suddenly burst out with a huge pressure that collapsed in all directions.
<br><br>Under this pressure, even Li Shuhua and others were shaken backwards, stabilizing their feet and then looking at Song Ke's body, their expressions all changed greatly.
<br><br>"Not good, Song Ke has broken the saint!"
<br><br>"What's going on, how could this happen?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu emitted a panicked voice, his face filled with shock.
<br><br>Never thought that the two extinctions of the doppelgangers had not been able to bring any effect on Song Ke's main body, and even broke the saint ahead of schedule.
<br><br>The reason why Song Ke didn't find them, I'm afraid it was also because all his mind was in the middle of the breakthrough.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>The crowd shouted in panic, "How about taking advantage of the fact that his attention is not on us yet and hurry up and leave?"
<br><br>"No, it's true that Song Ke hasn't found us now, but if we move with our cultivation, he will detect us, and I'm afraid that before we can escape from the mountain range, we will be caught up by him after breaking the Saint!" Li Shuhua said gruffly.
<br><br>"Then what should we do, fight?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu gritted his teeth and said, "See that trunk of different colors under his tree, there is the heart of his tree, we just need to take advantage of his unpreparedness to destroy it, Song Ke's strength will be greatly reduced, and then we will not have the power to fight."
<br><br>But the crowd was full of bitterness.
<br><br>The Heart of the Tree is something as important as the demon cores of other demon beasts, and is also equivalent to a human's Dantian, the pivot of the entire power output, whose importance is self-evident.
<br><br>It seems that Song Ke's Tree Heart is on the trunk, but how is it so easy to destroy?
<br><br>This idea, it simply won't work.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yang Tianyu also knew that he had just thrown himself at the doctor in an emergency, so he had to say again with a face full of urgency, "Then in that case, it's better to take advantage of the fact that Song Ke didn't find us before thinking of a way, once he finds out, it's already too late to think of a way."
<br><br>"It seems that this is the only way to go."
<br><br>Li Shuhua gritted his teeth and took out a scroll in his hand.
<br><br>"This is, your Li family secret treasure concealment of the formation?" Yang Tianyu emitted a surprised voice.
<br><br>Li Shuhua solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>This concealment formation is considered one of his Li family's greatest treasures, this time brought here also to prevent accidents.
<br><br>But did not expect to really use it.
<br><br>The crowd nodded, currently can not escape, can not fight, only able to temporarily hide in the formation, so better than no life.
<br><br>"The formation of concealment space is limited, there are too many of us, so you quickly to crouch position to me, so that the space is barely enough!" Li Shuhua said in a hurry.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd moved in succession, leaning towards Li Shuhua in a crouching position.
<br><br>"Formation of concealment, move!"
<br><br>Li Shuhua hand scroll a wave, a spatial force immediately enveloped the crowd, and then a dozen people disappeared into thin air.
<br><br>And the concealment of the formation of the brilliant, is exactly this.
<br><br>Able to form a small space of their own, the outside world can not see through the inside of the space, while they are able to look out from the inside.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Gnat-like humans, think I don't know that you are hiding there?"
<br><br>"Stupid method of concealment, see how this ancestor can break it with his strength ......"
<br><br>Among the tree trunk, a pair of eyes suddenly grew out, emitting a huge pressure of might.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>An invisible force enveloped the entire space, completely suppressing the aura Song Ke just had.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Song Ke's face changed greatly, and his sharp gaze was immediately cast around.
<br><br>Because of this power, it pressed even his Demon Saint's power to death, completely unable to exert it.
