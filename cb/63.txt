Yi Feng was confused in the wind.
<br><br>What is this with what ah?
<br><br>Wu Yonghong four old man said is something, rushed away, in front of his that counter left a big pile of broken things!
<br><br>Say what, part of it is just what he ordered, another part is the last rake head money?
<br><br>But, you really give what rake head money you give money ah, get such a big pile of broken things is what the hell.
<br><br>Yi Feng heart really speechless ah!
<br><br>These rags are really unsightly.
<br><br>A pair of boots, looking like rain boots; an umbrella, worn out, but also printed with a variety of ghost painting pattern; in addition there are some unintelligible broken things ......
<br><br>That's all!
<br><br>It is estimated that the old man Wu really can not afford to give that rake head money, the heart and feel sorry for the family of these broken things used to offset the debt.
<br><br>Good thing, Yi Feng is not short of money today. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Really, the rain boots and umbrella for him also a little use, which day it rains on the rain boots on the umbrella to go out to play a little wine, but also quite in place!
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>At this time, the dog came a wailing sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at it, ignored.
<br><br>But Ao Qing continued to owl constantly, this is his instinct as a demon beast, especially when he encountered something fearful.
<br><br>At this moment, his eyes were staring at a small door behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>He has been here for so long, in fact, never put this small door in mind, usually did not go in himself not to mention, also rarely see Yi Feng go in, originally thought it was a miscellaneous room, but now he does not feel so.
<br><br>He always felt that there was something hidden inside.
<br><br>Because of the vague feeling that from time to time, a deep and terrifying aura comes from inside.
<br><br>But slightly reassured him, Yi Feng, as always, lying on the recliner, for the small door that emanates the aura but does not care.
<br><br>But he was still curious, inside, in the end, what is hidden?
<br><br>......
<br><br>Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Yin Xiong had specially sent someone to invite Luo Lanxue.
<br><br>"Ahem, niece ah, soon Pingjiang City ushered in the annual poetry conference, the conference will invite all the poetry lords and literary greats in the city, Mr. Supreme Treasure is so explosive, I am going to invite Mr. to attend as well, but between Mr.'s identity, I can't decide, what do you think?"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Luo Lanxue fell into contemplation.
<br><br>Then said, "Mr. condescending with Pingjiang City has two points, while setting up a big game, but also in the sense of the life of mortals."
<br><br>"Anything you have to do, as long as it doesn't ruin the big picture of Mr. and doesn't affect Mr.'s original intention of sensing mortal life, there shouldn't be any problem."
<br><br>"This is easy to solve if it doesn't affect the original intention of entering the mortal world, just take the mortal's point of view when you are in contact with him." Yin Xiong frowned and said, "But, what exactly is the big picture that Mr. laid out?"
<br><br>At that, Luo Lanxue could not help but let out a bitter smile and said softly: "The big picture set by Mr., is not something you and I can guess, in any case, everything is cautious and careful is, but a poetry conference, the participants are also some mortals, since you have the intention to invite Mr., then you can directly invite, Mr. if you are interested, will go."
<br><br>"Mm."
<br><br>Yin Xiong nodded and said solemnly, "Niece, I probably understand what you mean."
<br><br>After discussing with Luo Lanxue, Yin Xiong personally ran to the martial arts school, while handing an invitation to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Lying on the recliner, Yi Feng looked at the invitation in his hand.
<br><br>That's fine.
<br><br>It is idle, why not go to see.
<br><br>He would like to see whether the cultural knowledge of this other world is deeper or his Yanhuang 5,000 years of heritage is just stronger.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Is it a poetry contest?"
<br><br>In a courtyard, Demon Ling'er looked at the news in her hand and her pretty eyebrows raised slightly.
<br><br>These days she through a series of means, probably inquired about this mysterious youth's usual state of life.
<br><br>She decided.
<br><br>This was a supreme person who had stepped into the mortal world and sensed life.
<br><br>Since it was a poetry conference for mortals, this was a rare and good opportunity for her.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Daughter, my father has something to say to you today."
<br><br>In the middle of another luxurious courtyard, Mao Lin looked at his daughter Mao Yun'er and said in a serious tone, "Daughter, let me ask you, what exactly do you think about this author of the Dream of the Red Chamber and the Supreme Treasure?"
<br><br>"Father, what do you ...... mean by asking this?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er said softly, while speaking, the pretty face could not help but be filled with red.
<br><br>"The truth is, because of this supreme treasure, the chamber of commerce will probably lose the first opportunity in the competition for the first chamber of commerce, so my father asked you, to have a good relationship with that Yi Feng, even, even ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Mao Lin reddened an old face, is really a little unable to say.
<br><br>He never thought that a countryside commoner would actually let him go this far.
<br><br>"Father, I know what you mean, I will try my best ......" Mao Lin's meaning was already obvious, however, Mao Yun'er seemed to have nothing else to say about Mao Lin's idea.
