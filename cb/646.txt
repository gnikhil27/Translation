"What, you?"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan was stunned.
<br><br>Then, as if she heard some big joke, she said with a face full of ridicule, "Lu Chong, seeking death is not like you, there is a heavenly difference between you and me, and you still dare to challenge my master, how ridiculous."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Faced with Li Qingxuan's mockery, Lu Chong didn't even look at her.
<br><br>Because Li Qingxuan wouldn't be worthy of being put in his eyes.
<br><br>He just quietly looked at Li Hongtian.
<br><br>This made Li Qingxuan very unhappy.
<br><br>Why should this guy, show this uncaring look!
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>Li Hongtian laughed out loud, and after the laughter stopped, his face sank. Remember in a second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Houshang boy, are you here to play with me?"
<br><br>"This continent lord doesn't have so much time to waste with you!"
<br><br>"Die straight away!"
<br><br>Icy words came out from Li Hongtian's mouth, and at the same time the voice fell, Li Hongtian raised his palm.
<br><br>A fierce squeeze.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>The space surrounding Lu Chong's body began to compress sharply as it closed in on Lu Chong.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Li Qingxuan raised the corners of her mouth, filled with a cold smile.
<br><br>The death of Lu Chong is the best thing that could happen to her, and the marriage contract will no longer exist, saving her a lot of trouble.
<br><br>Only because of her identity, in order to avoid gossip, before the bad to Lu Chong just, this is engaged in a one-year agreement.
<br><br>And now Lu Chong provoked her master, was executed, others are naturally nothing to say.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>A few breaths of time passed.
<br><br>Lu Chong but quietly standing in mid-air, half a thing, it seems that the compressed space around him half a little impact.
<br><br>The most unbelievable thing for her was that Lu Chong that outlined the corners of his mouth while carrying a hint of mockery.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan's eyes widened.
<br><br>This level of spatial compression, not to mention Lu Chong, even she, Li Qingxuan, was afraid that she would only end up drinking hate.
<br><br>Can't help it.
<br><br>She turned her questioning gaze to Li Hongtian at the side.
<br><br>But this does not look okay, a look but found Li Hongtian the same oh mouth, that look, simply more surprised than her.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>As the person in question, Li Hongtian, at this moment is a difficult state of mind, as if set off shocking waves.
<br><br>Just now he urged the power of Lu Chong to space compression of that feeling, as if an ordinary person holding a pile of iron in his hand.
<br><br>Even if you red neck, the shit is pressed out, but can not make that iron change half of the feeling.
<br><br>Too bizarre.
<br><br>"Kid, it's me who underestimated you."
<br><br>Li Hongtian's hoarse voice, "So you are not at all like the rumored waste, but you are hiding your clumsiness, and hiding it very, very deep, at least, as comparable as that old man next to you."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Hiding clumsiness?"
<br><br>"And on par with the old man next to you?"
<br><br>"Wouldn't that be? Late stage of True Origin Immortal Realm!"
<br><br>On the side, Li Qingxuan's eyes widened, completely unable to believe this fact and hurriedly shouted, "Master, are you mistaken, a month or so ago, I had seen him, he clearly only had the strength of a Heavenly Immortal on him, although now he had used something to hide his cultivation, but in a month's time, he could still carp and jump the dragon gate?"
<br><br>Li Qingxuan was completely unable to accept this result.
<br><br>This object that was to be withdrawn from her marriage.
<br><br>The object that had been rejected and even looked down upon by her, was even stronger than her?
<br><br>Or even had a cultivation level that she looked up to?
<br><br>The company's main goal is to provide the best possible service to its customers.
<br><br>But this Lu Chong who is the same age as her ......
<br><br>"No ......"
<br><br>"Impossible."
<br><br>"This is simply impossible ......"
<br><br>She muttered.
<br><br>This kind of thing was too heavenly, and the blow to her self-confidence was just too great.
<br><br>"The Star Immortal Realm is worthy of being the Star Immortal Realm!" For Li Hongtian to be able to see through his own strength at a glance, Lu Chong was quite surprised, and then proceeded to say indifferently, "Since you know my strength, so don't be making that kind of pedestrian move, just attack with all your might!"
<br><br>After saying.
<br><br>Lu Chong slightly retreated.
<br><br>His face was a little excited and solemn at the same time.
<br><br>After all, it was also his first time fighting a strong person of the Star Immortal Realm.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when Lu Chong's face was solemn and even his fighting stance was set up, Li Hongtian suddenly took out a small white flag from nowhere.
<br><br>"I surrender!"
<br><br>While holding up the small white flag, he said.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Lu Chong froze.
<br><br>Momentarily confused.
<br><br>Gong Chen on the side was also full of confusion.
<br><br>Of course the most stunned was Li Qingxuan, who stared at her master with wide eyes and shouted incredulously, "Master, you, you ......"
<br><br>"You shut up, there is no place for you to speak."
<br><br>Li Hongtian reprimanded her, then said in a serious manner, "I think we, right, indeed there is no need to fight."
<br><br>"It's just a withdrawal of marriage?"
<br><br>"This Li Qingxuan is not worthy of you, so what do you want to do next, you look at it, you take her away on the spot or you are repudiating her on the spot, I do not say anything, you are happy."
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>Let Gong Chen and Lu Chong even more confused.
<br><br>The reason they wanted to challenge Li Hongtian directly was because they were afraid that after defeating Li Qingxuan, this Li Hongtian would interfere.
<br><br>So in order to save time before directly challenging Li Hongtian.
<br><br>But did not expect that this fellow, who directly did not fight, even said such words?
<br><br>"Master, you, you actually, why?"
<br><br>"Even if it's the late True Origin Immortal realm, you are completely able to defeat easily, huh?"
<br><br>"And he can't even be at the True Origin Immortal Realm, he's just a waste!"
<br><br>On the side, Li Qingxuan trembled and shouted hysterically.
<br><br>"You shut up."
<br><br>Li Hongtian slapped over and directly slapped Li Qingxuan away.
<br><br>Then with a smile on his face, he said towards Lu Chong, "I was, just now, speaking very sincerely."
