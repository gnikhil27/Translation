Lu Dasheng was almost scared by this shout rose to the sky.
<br><br>If not for the tightness of the legs, pants are also afraid to wet.
<br><br>And at this moment Yi Feng is really full of confusion, this what Lu Dasheng first came to toe a high meal, and kneel on the ground to drop a broken ring, is simply a psychotic it!
<br><br>And finally, Lu Dasheng shivered and turned his head, while wiping the sweat on his face, lifting his heavy feet to walk towards Yi Feng again.
<br><br>"What the hell are you doing?" Yi Feng shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I-I-I, I'm really here to deliver something!" Lu Dasheng said tearlessly.
<br><br>"Deliver something?"
<br><br>"Send you paralyzed!"
<br><br>Yi Feng coldly laughed, although this Lu Dasheng's demeanor was out of the ordinary, but looking at this person's previous attitude, he knew he was not a good bird.
<br><br>"I I I ......"
<br><br>Rudasheng wiped cold sweat from his forehead. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But how dare he admit that he came to pick a fight, he could only stammer, unable to say anything for half a day.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>At that exact moment, three figures respectfully walked over, none other than the three Wu Yonghongs.
<br><br>"Three Martial Sects?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng, who was stammering, saw Wu Yonghong's three people and stared at once, Martial Emperor experts are already very senior existences in Nansha, and as for Martial Sects, they are even more rare, and usually can't be found by beating the lantern.
<br><br>But the door of this martial arts school, at once gathered three!
<br><br>And the side of the same nervous Lu Qingshan is also slightly stunned, but also did not lose their composure too much, contact more, he has long been immune, in Mr. here to see three martial arts experts, seems to be a normal thing.
<br><br>After all, the terror of the black robe, Lu Qingshan has seen it with his own eyes, but now is still being trampled under the feet of Mr. struggling, three martial arts sects and what is it?
<br><br>The three Wu Yonghong just simply looked at Lu Qingshan and Lu Dasheng, and then did not care anymore, after all, in the eyes of the three of them, these two people are not up to anything.
<br><br>However, the arrival of the three people temporarily relieved Lu Dasheng, because Yi Feng's attention had come to the three of them.
<br><br>"It's the three of you!"
<br><br>Yi Feng greeted, "Why are you free to come over today."
<br><br>"Sir, it's us. Didn't you say earlier in the mountains that there was a piece of wasteland behind your martial arts school that needed to be reclaimed and asked us to come and help?" Wu Yonghong said respectfully.
<br><br>"Right, right, right."
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped his head, then remembered and said, "Yes, I do plan to reclaim that piece of wasteland."
<br><br>"It's like this sir, these two old friends of mine also want to come along, what do you think?" Wu Yonghong said again.
<br><br>After he said that, Sun Zhuge and Chu Mad Lion behind him, immediately looked over expectantly.
<br><br>"They also want to come along, that's fine."
<br><br>Yi Feng slightly thought, then nodded, look at the two expectant eyes, obviously also want to come to earn a meal, farmers, can understand, live a life is not easy, and say his piece of land is not small, old man Wu get up alone manpower is really short.
<br><br>"Well, well, thank you sir, thank you sir."
<br><br>At these words, the three old ancestors instantly smiled with their eyebrows.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng could not help but feel that the bottom of the people living is really difficult ah, not just reclaiming a piece of broken land, actually so excited, so said again: "compensation, I will directly give you three a hundred gold coins, even if you get it done in a day is a hundred gold coins."
<br><br>"No problem no problem!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people nodded their heads, no opinion on Yi Feng said a hundred gold coins, and did not want to pick a break, after all, they all understand that this is originally into the mortal to play the game of the earth's supreme master, so a hundred gold coins to go through is also in the reasonable.
<br><br>"Good, then no problem, have you brought your tools?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three awkwardly look at each other, revealing an embarrassed look.
<br><br>"Okay, it's okay, I have it here, you guys wait here first." Yi Feng stomped heavily on the skull again, before walking into the inner room.
<br><br>Subsequently, under the waiting of several people, Yi Feng took out a rake, a hoe and a shovel.
<br><br>However, seeing the three shovels, both Wu Yonghong three, or the trembling Lu Dasheng, sucked in a breath of cold air, almost directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>Actually, they took out three holy items directly?
<br><br>"One for each of you three!" Yi Feng reached over and said.
<br><br>"Here, here, here, for us?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people looked at each other's eyes, their voices stuttered, and their palms trembled at this moment.
<br><br>"How can you work if you don't give it?" Yi Feng gave them a white glance and said, "Use it for now, I still have it there if it breaks."
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>"Also ...... still have?"
<br><br>This sentence, almost did not scare out the heart of Wu Yonghong three people.
<br><br>Sir here the sacred goods, is more than enough to have the peddling?
<br><br>And reclaiming a piece of wasteland just, but also used three pieces of sacred goods, this kind of hand, tsk ......
<br><br>However, the side of Lu Qingshan was not too surprised, and even showed a look of looking at the country bumpkins.
<br><br>His strength may not be as high as these three, but the eyesight here in Mr. is not what they can compare, what is the opening of the wilderness with the sacred goods? The knives in Mr. kitchen cutting vegetables are holy products.
