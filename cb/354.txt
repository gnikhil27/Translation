The moment Rhinoceros Earth landed on the ground with the black bear on his back, Rhinoceros Earth's eyes rolled over and he lay on the ground spitting up white foam.
<br><br>"Lao-san, Lao-san."
<br><br>Seeing this, the two demons of rhinoceros forest hurriedly sent out a transmission towards rhinoceros earth.
<br><br>"Big brother and second brother I ...... I'm fine, don't worry about me, I'll be fine after a little rest."
<br><br>Rhinoceros earth difficult to get up from the ground, said softly.
<br><br>"Okay, keep going."
<br><br>However, his voice just fell, the skeleton Ben Wei behind the sound came out again.
<br><br>Smell the sound.
<br><br>Rhinoceros earth a shiver, almost a breath did not slow down.
<br><br>Good thing, the gloomy-eyed black feather came out with a voice.
<br><br>"Almost, it's time to make a move." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The three demons of the rhinoceros forest immediately agitated, and quickly said respectfully: "Lord Black Feather, you wait here for a little while, until the three of us brothers go to take these four mole crickets down."
<br><br>"Very well, go ahead!"
<br><br>Black Feather leisurely emitted a cold laugh.
<br><br>The three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest instantly turned their gaze of tiger eyes towards the unaware Bone Ben Wei few.
<br><br>"Big brother, can you let me go and get that damn big dog bear."
<br><br>On the occasion of the move, rhinoceros earth gritted his teeth and looked at the naive black bear, his voice was hoarse, seeing that this journey he had long accumulated a full of hatred.
<br><br>"Good, then to avoid the long night, the three of us together, Lao San you will deal with that big dog bear, Lao Er you deal with that dog, as for that skeleton and that centipede will be left to me!" Rhinoceros Lin instructed.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Tu Rhinoceros Miao hastily answered.
<br><br>The three demons' bodies bowed slightly, and their power surged through their bodies.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when they were about to make their move, the clouds in the sky suddenly changed and gathered together.
<br><br>Countless thunder rays also began to condense at this moment.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The three demons of Rhinoceros Forest who were about to make their move raised their heads fiercely and stared deadly at the sky.
<br><br>Looking at the stupidly moving thunder clouds, even the demon immortal strength of them felt terrifying.
<br><br>"It seems like it's because of that dog bear's seal."
<br><br>Black Feather likewise looked up at the sky and explained.
<br><br>"But a small seal, how can it trigger such a big thunderstorm, and the target of the seal is only a black bear of normal strength, this simply defies common sense!" Rhinoceros Lin couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Yes, it does go against common sense."
<br><br>Black feather's expression was also full of shock.
<br><br>Because this level of thunder tribulation, even for him in the Immortal Realm, which was beyond the strength of a Universal Immortal, he felt the pressure.
<br><br>Even he had to admit that if this lightning fell on his body, he might not be able to withstand it.
<br><br>"I really didn't expect that a sealing power of the lower realm would be so powerful."
<br><br>Black Feather couldn't help but murmur.
<br><br>"Then, what then, Lord Blackfeather?"
<br><br>The three demons of Rhinoceros Forest couldn't help but ask, under this kind of thunderstorm, they didn't dare to make a move for a while.
<br><br>"No need to panic, this lightning tribulation will not target other people, only that dog bear, therefore that dog bear will definitely die, isn't this the same as solving an enemy for us without any effort." Black feather sneered: "The rest to solve, will not be even easier?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the eyes of the three demons of the rhinoceros forest suddenly lit up.
<br><br>Except for Rhinoceros Earth who was quite a bit regretful that he couldn't kill the dog bear by himself, the others all showed a look of relief.
<br><br>"So, you listen to my orders, when the lightning tribulation comes down later, the dog bear will be ashes, the others will also be in a mess, and then it is a good time for you to make your move." Black Feather said in another voice.
<br><br>"Lord Black Feather, will this be too cautious?"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin could not help but ask: "Why not dare to directly get rid of that broken skeleton before the lightning tribulation, anyway, a few small mole crickets, move easily."
<br><br>"No, no, no."
<br><br>"Always remember my words, pattern and city is important." Black feather moved feathers, said leisurely.
<br><br>"But, does it have anything to do with pattern and city?" Rhino Earth asked.
<br><br>Black feather glared at him, then said: "Then you remember my other words, enough caution to do the demon on the demon."
<br><br>"But what you said, isn't it true that you can only become a demon on a demon by being a gou in gou?" Rhinoceros earth asked again.
<br><br>Black feather God could not help but slightly twitch a little.
<br><br>Coughing, he explained, "One meaning, one meaning."
<br><br>The three demons nodded their heads.
<br><br>At the same time, they looked at Black Feather in awe.
<br><br>The immortal world big brother was worthy of being an immortal world big brother.
<br><br>In addition to the pattern and the city, they had learned something else from the big brother.
<br><br>That was to be cautious enough!
<br><br>Sure enough, one could always learn something when one was beside a strong person.
<br><br>"By the way, Lord Blackfeather, if there is an unforeseen accident, please also ask Lord Blackfeather to step in at any time." Seeing the thunder clouds getting thicker and thicker, Hornblower Lin thought about it and said towards Black Feather.
<br><br>"Don't worry, if there is really a change, I will step in at any time, now let you guys step in, it's just that I don't care to make a move on these losers, otherwise I would let them fly into dust with a wave of my hand." Black feather angled his head, said.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin and others nodded their heads.
<br><br>There is Lord Black Feather pressure, even if there is really any accident, there is no worry.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The thunderstorm is getting thicker and thicker.
<br><br>Already is enveloped the entire sky.
<br><br>"Oooh, so scared ah, I really just a harmless little bear ah, God why do this to me."
<br><br>And under the thunderstorm, the black bear with both palms holding his head lying on the ground, burying his head in the land, arching his buttocks, trembling and shivering.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A pillar of thunder as thick as a water tank descended with a bang.
<br><br>"Do it."
<br><br>Also at the same time, Black Feather sent out a voice towards the three people of Hornblind.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin three people body aura fierce out, almost and thunderstorm synchronized attack out.
<br><br>The rhinoceros forest locked the skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>Rhinoceros Miao locked the dog.
<br><br>The rhinoceros earth is locked the centipede.
<br><br>As for under the thunderbolt, the dog bear that will certainly die, they are directly ignored.
<br><br>Finally, waiting for this moment.
<br><br>The faces of the three demons flashed with a strong look of excitement.
<br><br>Finally, too, they were able to snowball their shame.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>The three whistled out, energy gushed from their mouths, and powerful attacks came out of the air.
