"Brother Yi Feng, this is Meng Li Xian."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji introduced.
<br><br>"Hello."
<br><br>Yi Feng clasped his fist.
<br><br>"How do you do."
<br><br>The long-skirted beauty smiled, but a meaningful color surged at the corners of her mouth.
<br><br>"This is Yin Shengfu."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji introduced the gray-clothed old man toward Yi Feng again.
<br><br>"Greetings, Old Brother Yin."
<br><br>Yi Feng clasped his fist again and said.
<br><br>But Yin Shengfu did not pay attention to Yi Feng, but sat down by himself, and then closed his eyes to recuperate. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng was awkwardly staggered in place and frowned.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing had an apprehension in his heart and angrily glared at Yin Shengfu, but the latter completely ignored it.
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng, don't mind him, let's drink our." Desolate Wujing hurriedly comforted. In his heart, he was afraid that Yi Feng would get angry.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and didn't put too much thought into it.
<br><br>"Come, come, come and drink."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing hastily raised his cup and said.
<br><br>"Good to drink."
<br><br>Yi Feng and Meng Li Xian similarly raised their glasses.
<br><br>After drinking a glass, Meng Li Xian put the glass down gently and looked at Yi Feng meaningfully and said, "Brother Yi Feng, you don't know, just now Desolate Wu Jie has praised you to the sky, saying how you are so how ......"
<br><br>"So I guess you ...... must be multi-talented, right?"
<br><br>At these words, Desolate Wujing's face sank.
<br><br>Instantly, he heard the words in Meng Li Xian's words, and quickly glared at her.
<br><br>But Meng Li Xian ignored it and still looked at Yi Feng with those gleaming eyes, full of inquiries.
<br><br>"That's just old brother Desolate lifting me up, what talent can I have, I'm just a mortal!" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>Meng Li Xian raised the corner of her interesting mouth and asked again, "Even a mortal always has some talent, right?"
<br><br>"Meng Li Xian, you've had enough!"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing finally couldn't hold back and heaved the wine cup in his hand.
<br><br>"Desolate Wujing, what's your hurry? I'm just kowtowing to this brother of yours." Meng Li Xian shouted back at Desolate Wu Jie, then looked at Yi Feng with a smile on his face and asked leisurely, "So brother Yi, do you think I'm right?"
<br><br>"You're right."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, but his expression became equally meaningful.
<br><br>"So brother Yi Feng, what talent do you have exactly?" Meng Li Xian asked.
<br><br>"There are indeed, and quite a few."
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Then in that case, then Brother Yi Feng hurry up and show me your hand?" Meng Li Xian asked with a look of expectation.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng raised his head and asked in return, "Why should I show you a hand?"
<br><br>"And what does it matter to you what talent I have?"
<br><br>"And furthermore, do I know you well?"
<br><br>Three questions in a row.
<br><br>It directly caused Meng Li Xian to be stunned on the spot.
<br><br>The face, filled with gloom, was extremely unattractive.
<br><br>In those sharp eyes, there was even a faint flicker of anger.
<br><br>She could see, this young man in front of her is what kind of high level person, not capable, but temper is not small.
<br><br>I didn't expect that, dare to talk to her like this.
<br><br>If not for the sake of the desolate pathless, she was afraid that she had already shot.
<br><br>"Humph, you guys drink, I'll take my leave."
<br><br>Meng Li Xian coldly snorted, and then turned around to leave.
<br><br>"Take your time and don't see me off."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing also gave an angry grunt, his heart apprehensive to the extreme, regretting that he should not have promised Meng Li Xian to come.
<br><br>But for Meng Li Xian's departure, Yi Feng didn't even look at it.
<br><br>From the time this woman entered the door, he could see it, Yin and Yang, for the sake of Desolate Wujing, he always kept his patience.
<br><br>But the latter got an inch, treating him like a fool, so naturally he would not give her any face.
<br><br>"Come old brother, let's continue drinking."
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up the wine cup and raised it towards Desolate Pathless, originally wanting to also call out to Yin Shengfu next to him to join him, but looking at his expressionless look, Yi Feng did not choose to make a nuisance of himself.
<br><br>"Drink and drink."
<br><br>The apprehensive Desolate Wuji saw that Yi Feng didn't put Meng Li Xian in his heart at all, so he was relieved.
<br><br>In his heart, he also developed a hint of admiration for Yi Feng.
<br><br>This brother of his, a high ranking person was a high ranking person, and did not really get angry in the face of such a manner of Meng Li Xian.
<br><br>This makes him think he can not do.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he could not help but let out a bitter smile.
<br><br>The same are pretending to be a mortal, but there is a gap between the two everywhere, Yi Feng this is called a real return to the basics ah!
<br><br>"Huh, old brother you actually have a side of the zither here, can I play it?"
<br><br>After drinking two more cups with Desolate Wujian, Yi Feng saw a side of a zither, and immediately asked excitedly.
<br><br>"Oh, brother, you still know the zither?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing immediately asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Slightly understand."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"This zither is placed here by my daughter to play usually, brother if you are interested feel free to use it." Desolate Wujing said.
<br><br>"Good, then I will see you laugh."
<br><br>Yi Feng put down his wine glass and couldn't help but get up.
<br><br>Honestly, this moment he is really some hand itching, drinking wine, farting, and then with some music, is simply a great pleasure in life ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng sat in front of the piano table, his long and slender hands slowly fell to the strings ......
<br><br>Outside the courtyard.
<br><br>Meng Li Xian's anger had not subsided.
<br><br>She could never understand that Desolation Wu Path was actually so impatient with her for someone else, and scolded her frequently.
<br><br>You say this person is really some kind of high person she can understand, but it is a mortal ......
<br><br>And she said to go also really want her to go, actually did not come out to chase her.
<br><br>Is this mortal more important than her?
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>She is the more she thinks, the more angry.
<br><br>"OK, Desolate Wujing, I will never come to you again."
<br><br>Seeing that the inner courtyard's Desolate Wujing didn't put her in mind at all, she stomped her palm and left in anger.
<br><br>Just at this time, the sound of the zither in the inner courtyard came out leisurely ......
