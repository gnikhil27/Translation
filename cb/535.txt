The two men were dumbfounded.
<br><br>If Wu Tian abdicated, then who should they give the holy decree in their hands to?
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>The person they were targeting was Wu Tian!
<br><br>In the Genting Empire.
<br><br>The World Exterminator and the Genting Kingdom Monarch sat cross-legged next to the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>Then, both of them opened their eyes at the same time.
<br><br>"If I guessed correctly, the two should have already arrived at the Wu Tian Empire, right?" Perdition said indifferently.
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>"If there are no surprises, I'm afraid that the holy decree has already reached that Wu Tian's hands." The Genting king said, "I guess a letter will be coming from there soon."
<br><br>His voice just fell. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The jade simplicity had already lit up.
<br><br>Seeing this, the Genting Kingdom Monarch's eyes lit up with slight excitement.
<br><br>"Look, it's true that what you say comes, and indeed a letter has already come."
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Perishable was also slightly happy.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as the two were in the midst of their joy, the message that came out of the jade slip likewise left the two dumbstruck.
<br><br>Wu Tian had abdicated.
<br><br>The two choked on the news and vomited blood straight away.
<br><br>"What's going on, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler drank with a gloomy face, "This Wu Tian Empire was originally a chaotic small empire that had only just established its name, so it hasn't been long since this Wu Tian reigned, how come he suddenly abdicated?"
<br><br>Next to the extermination is also puzzled.
<br><br>Just laid down the rivers and mountains do not want, is not this brain disease?
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"If he abdicates, he abdicates, he is still a member of the Wu Tian Empire, and also under the jurisdiction of my Cloud Top Empire, give me the holy decree to send as usual."
<br><br>Soon, the Genting kingdom ruler accepted the fact and had an idea to make a decision directly, issuing an order towards the two.
<br><br>"But Lord Sovereign, if Wu Tian is still in the position of Sovereign, we can use the subsidiary seal to control him, now he is not Sovereign anymore, the seal automatically disappears, if he does not come after receiving the holy decree, there is nothing we can do with him, ah?" One of them said worriedly.
<br><br>"Hmph, so what if we don't have the Seal of Affiliation, do you really think that without the Seal of Affiliation, the Genting Empire can't do anything to a small king?"
<br><br>If he doesn't come, tell him that he will be executed for resisting the decree, even if he runs to the ends of the earth, the Genting Empire can easily take his life."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The two people who were sent to the Wu Tian Empire also had the courage.
<br><br>Think about it.
<br><br>Compared to the Genting Empire, what is this small Wu Tian Empire?
<br><br>This Wu Tian.
<br><br>The two people who received the holy decree really dare not obey it?
<br><br>The two men, as messengers sent from above, entered the palace of the Wu Tian Empire with high spirits.
<br><br>Within the palace hall.
<br><br>Although Wu Tian had already abdicated, he was still sitting at the top presiding over the situation for the time being.
<br><br>Seeing the arrival of the two messengers, Wu Tian frowned slightly.
<br><br>For this Genting Empire, he had actually never been a fan.
<br><br>Usually when they are subordinate small empires chaotic conquest, the top does not even look at you, simply do not care whether you live or die.
<br><br>When you have some accumulation, you have to provide a lot of resources again.
<br><br>"You are Wu Tian?"
<br><br>Two people stood in the main hall, looking up at Wu Tian, and a majestic voice came out.
<br><br>"It's me!"
<br><br>Wu Tian nodded his head.
<br><br>"The two of us, by the order of the ruler of the Genting Kingdom, have come to convey the holy decree to you."
<br><br>"In view of Wu Tian's resourcefulness, valor and courage, and his merits in unifying the Wu Tian Empire, he hereby declares Wu Tian to appear before the imperial court on a day to be holy."
<br><br>The content of the holy decree was very short and concise.
<br><br>After saying that, the one who read the holy decree raised his head and said, "The above is the content of the holy decree, in addition to the verbal holy decree of the ruler of the Genting Kingdom."
<br><br>"Speak."
<br><br>Wu Tian passed out his voice.
<br><br>"The meaning of the Lord of the Genting Kingdom is that he admires you and the reason why he asked you to appear before the court is because the Lord of the Genting Kingdom wants to confer the throne of the Genting Empire on you." The man said.
<br><br>"The throne?"
<br><br>Wu Tian's pupils twitched.
<br><br>"Good, it's the throne."
<br><br>"Do you know the importance of this throne?"
<br><br>"Since the Genting Empire, there are only two people who can be crowned king, and these two are the two most powerful kings of the affiliated empires."
<br><br>"It would not have been your turn in any case, Wu Tian Empire, but it was also stated in the holy decree just now that it was because His Majesty appreciated you."
<br><br>"So, why don't you quickly kneel down and thank the ronin?"
<br><br>But.
<br><br>Wu Tian, however, shook his head.
<br><br>"What are you shaking your head for?"
<br><br>The man who read the decree asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I am trying to say that you are late."
<br><br>Wu Tian said indifferently, "I am no longer the ruler of the Genting Kingdom."
<br><br>"If you are not the Genting king, you naturally cannot be crowned king, after all, as I recall, the prerequisite for being crowned king in Genting is the imperial king, right?"
<br><br>"You do not need to say much about this matter, the king of Genting already knows, and he does not mind that you are no longer the king of the country, what he appreciates is your talent, so you can still be crowned king!" The man who delivered the decree sent out a voice, "So you don't need to have so many doubts anymore, quickly thank the ronin!"
<br><br>But Wu Tian frowned.
<br><br>Because he smelled a hint of something unusual.
<br><br>In the past, what was the purpose of crowning a king?
<br><br>It was only to better control the subordinate empires, so the prerequisite for the crowning of the king would be the king of the country.
<br><br>And if not the king, for the Genting Empire, there is no value of crowning the king.
<br><br>But now it is because he broke this rule.
<br><br>Why is that?
<br><br>Anyway, he didn't think that everything he had shown in the Wu Tian Empire could really be appreciated much by the Genting king.
<br><br>Among them.
<br><br>I'm afraid it's a fine thought!
<br><br>After all, there is no pie falling from the sky for nothing.
<br><br>This genting king, I'm afraid there is a plan!
<br><br>And then step back, he Wu Tian is not at all happy to be this king.
<br><br>He Wu Tian king's position are resigned, I ran you there to be a fart to the king, I when the nima.
<br><br>If the gentleman knows he has no pattern, how disappointing it may be.
<br><br>So, Wu Tian lightly stepped out and said: "I am not interested in what king, what king, so I appreciate the kindness of the Genting king, you guys go back!"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The two emissaries' eyebrows instantly frowned.
<br><br>Their faces visibly turned gloomy.
<br><br>"Wu Tian, do you know what you are talking about?"
<br><br>The two dull voices came out and said in a cold voice: "You are saying this, but you want to disobey the decree?"
<br><br>Wu Tian was silent.
<br><br>He just looked at them indifferently, and the meaning was already very obvious.
<br><br>This made the two people angry.
<br><br>"Do you know what the consequences of this are?"
<br><br>"If you dare to disobey the will of the king of Genting, it is the crime of the destruction of the form and spirit."
<br><br>"Not only you, even your entire Wu Tian Empire will suffer a devastating blow."
<br><br>"Have you considered well that you can bear this result?"
<br><br>The two men's icy cold voices came out, with a threatening intent that was not concealed in the slightest.
<br><br>This caused Wu Tian to tighten his brow.
<br><br>He, Wu Tian, was not afraid of anything.
<br><br>However, when knowing that it would implicate the entire Wu Tian Empire, he inevitably had concerns in his heart.
<br><br>What to do?
<br><br>Wu Tian's heart did not know what to do for a while.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he could only ask the gentleman for advice again.
<br><br>He secretly took out a voice transmission jade slip and sent a voice transmission towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Dog thing!"
<br><br>"So those four gold coins were stolen by you."
<br><br>"I'll tear you down."
<br><br>In Yuan Jing's mansion, Yi Feng was dismantling Skeleton Ben Wei when he received a transmission from Wu Tian.
<br><br>Yi Feng casually took out the jade slip.
<br><br>In fact, this jade brief like the phone in the previous life, is considered a very common item in this world, not immortal cultivators can use, slightly richer mortals, can also afford to buy.
<br><br>Thinking about his jade brief, it seems that others sent him.
<br><br>The specific who gave it, he forgot.
<br><br>"Little chicken, what is it." Yi Feng picked up the jade brief and asked leisurely.
<br><br>"Sir is this, there are some decisive choices, still need to ask for your advice." Wu Tian said respectfully.
<br><br>"Aiya, didn't I tell you about these things before?"
<br><br>"The pattern!"
<br><br>"Pattern!"
<br><br>"Pattern!"
<br><br>"In short, do not be afraid when things go wrong, just go forward!"
<br><br>"Okay, I'm busy, I'm not talking to you, hang up."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng directly hung up the jade brief, lifted the sleeve to continue to dismantle the skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>And looking at the severed jade brief, Wu Tian stood in place, his mind reverberated for a long time Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>"Do not be afraid when things go wrong, just move forward ......"
<br><br>"Sir this sentence, seems to mean something!"
<br><br>Wu Tian narrowed his eyes, his heart seemed to have an understanding of these words.
<br><br>"There is also the pattern."
<br><br>"Sir repeatedly stressed the pattern with me ......"
<br><br>"Then what is the pattern that is bigger than the Genting king?"
<br><br>Muttering down, Wu Tian's eyes glazed over.
<br><br>The heart once again became clear.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>A cold breath was drawn backwards from his mouth.
<br><br>It turned out that Sir had such high expectations of him!
