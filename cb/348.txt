 "Qing, go and arrest him."
<br><br>In the back, Bones Ben Wei waved his hand and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Yes brother."
<br><br>The dog answered, and went over towards the black bear who was playing dead.
<br><br>"Hey, silly guy, hurry up and get up, it's useless to play dead in front of my brother." The dog said in a condescending manner.
<br><br>"Yes, although I appreciate you, but in front of the brother, play dead is useless." Night Wind duly climbed out and drank: "If my brother lets you live you can live, if he tells you to die you have to die."
<br><br>"Oooh, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm up." Black Bear hurriedly crawled up and knelt on the ground, crying bitterly and said, "Please, please a few lords, spare me."
<br><br>"Spare you? Hmph, say, what are you doing here sneaking around?" The dog bellowed seriously.
<br><br>This sentence, directly scared the black bear trembled.
<br><br>I was just a small bear sealed here, usually harmless, living on grass and dew, just saw several big brothers majestic, accompanied by a golden light descending from the top of the head, so I knew at first glance that this is the descent of a great big man, so I was afraid of bumping into you, so I hid here, but who knew that I still accidentally I was afraid of bumping into you.
<br><br>"Oh?" The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"You say this, seems a bit interesting."
<br><br>The dog raised his eyebrows and said, "Then you tell me, what kind of great big shot are we?"
<br><br>"Then Little Bear I'll say it out of the blue."
<br><br>Saying that, he turned his gaze to the night wind centipede, and then said, "For example, this one, although short in stature, but the shrewdness cast in that eye can make people understand that this is a wise person level."
<br><br>"As for this one ......"
<br><br>said, he turned his gaze to the dog, "This one looks stern, and his demeanor is forced everywhere, so his identity in the team is pivotal."
<br><br>"As for the last one ......"
<br><br>He turned his gaze to Bone Benevolent, and his voice lurched.
<br><br>"You do hurry up and say something."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's eyes were raised and he was busy pulling out his ears.
<br><br>"This one is really the most remarkable."
<br><br>"Bringing his own aura of superiority, at first glance, he is the core figure in the team, an absolute decision maker, and is handsome, suave and elegant."
<br><br>"Even aside from these, even the clothing is not to say, the black robe in the lake breeze reveals the transcendent atmosphere, simply let people worship plus submissive."
<br><br>"That is, I am not talented, hanging below a small tinker, otherwise it is bound to fall in love with this inevitable."
<br><br>The black bear touched his heart, as if pulling out the words of his heart.
<br><br>"Listen."
<br><br>"Listen to the words of others."
<br><br>"How beautifully said, how well summed us up?"
<br><br>The moment the black bear's voice fell, skeleton Ben Wei immediately wore an appreciative voice.
<br><br>"Indeed, it does sum up very well." The dog also nodded approvingly at the side, looking at Black Bear's gaze became incomparably smooth.
<br><br>"Yes, I two will not say, especially the brother's advantages summed up in place." Centipede also similarly agreed, while coming up to Bone Ben Wei and said, "Brother, it's not easy to come across such an open-eyed little guy, why don't we just take him in?"
<br><br>"Yes, brother I also think so, this bear, a little bit of talent." The dog also said.
<br><br>"Oh, you guys think so too?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the dog and the centipede, then said: "In that case, then take this little guy."
<br><br>Seeing this, Dog Zi and Centipede were delighted and hurriedly winked at Black Bear, while shouting, "Little Bear, why don't you hurry up and thank big brother?"
