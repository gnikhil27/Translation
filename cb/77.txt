Green Mountain Gate.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue respectfully came in front of the Castle Peak Elder and said softly, "The number one pill refiner in Southern Sand, Master Lu Dasheng Lu has come to my Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When Old Ancestor Qing Shan heard this, he immediately sat up and said excitedly, "Master Lu is here, why didn't you inform me earlier?"
<br><br>"I was seeing that you were in seclusion, Master, so I didn't disturb you." Luo Lanxue explained.
<br><br>"Okay, where is Grandmaster Lu, I'll go see him."
<br><br>Saying that, Old Ancestor Qingshan hurriedly got up, and his expression became a lot more solemn.
<br><br>He didn't dare to neglect Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>As the number one pill refiner in Nansha, although he was a scattered cultivator, he had unparalleled appeal, even the big clans and big families in Nansha would be polite to him.
<br><br>So this kind of person coming to his Qingshan Gate is undoubtedly coming to a big Buddha. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Lu Qingshan, meet Master Lu."
<br><br>Outside the door, Old Ancestor Qingshan attached himself respectfully and sent his voice towards the door.
<br><br>The door of the room, quietly opened.
<br><br>"Come in!" Inside, a hoarse voice came from inside.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak walked in, and on the futon, sat an old man clad in gray robes, the old man had a narrow face and pointed mouth, and his body exuded an aura that made people gloomy.
<br><br>"Little Castle Peak Sect, what a big frame!" Lu Dasheng slowly raised his head and looked at the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, saying soberly, "To actually make me, Lu Dasheng, wait here for half a month for you to come out of the gate, remarkable."
<br><br>These slightly mocking words caused Old Ancestor Qingshan's face to change slightly, and he hurriedly explained, "Master Lu doesn't dare, it's just that I really didn't know Master Lu was coming, so I hope I'm sorry for any negligence."
<br><br>"Just."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng waved his palm and said in a deep voice: "Don't say those superficial words, I came here for one purpose only, recently I want to refine a fifth-grade medicine for a certain Martial Emperor expert in Nansha, but I need to borrow the flame beads of your Qingshan Sect."
<br><br>"Flame beads?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak's face changed slightly.
<br><br>"I can promise you, as long as you are willing to lend the flame beads, not only do I owe you a favor, that Martial Emperor expert you are also considered to sell a favor, this kind of good thing can not be found ah!" Lu Dasheng looked at the old ancestor of Castle Peak and said leisurely.
<br><br>But Lu Qingshan's face became more and more ugly, and he bowed his head and said, "To be honest with you, Master Lu, your conditions are indeed very generous, but the Flame Pearl is not in my Qingshan Sect now, I have already given it away."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng's gaze sank, "Lu Qingshan, are you fooling me, the Flame Pearl is the treasure of your Qingshan Sect, you actually told me that you gave it away?"
<br><br>"Master Lu, that's really true."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan hurriedly explained.
<br><br>"Hmph, I don't care if you are real or not, I give you seven days to bring me the Flame Pearl, even if you really gave it away, you have to bring it back to me." Lu Dasheng said unquestionably.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Mount Qing had a difficult face.
<br><br>The flame bead was given to Mr. Yi Feng, and when it came to Mr., how could he ask for it back?
<br><br>And not to return the matter is small, caused the gentleman's displeasure that is the big trouble.
<br><br>"Well?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng raised his eyes.
<br><br>"Master, I'm afraid this thing really can not." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said with a difficult expression on his face, "If it is any other request, all will be met Master Lu, but this time please forgive me."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng narrowed his eyes at Castle Peak Old Ancestor and said leisurely, "I am suddenly curious, what exactly did you give this flame bead to that actually made you so scrupulous."
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan smiled bitterly, but his words were full of respect, saying, "That gentleman is not something I, Lu Qingshan, can evaluate at will, but he is my Lu Qingshan's life-saving benefactor, and the savior of my entire Qingshan Sect."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>A mocking look flashed in Lu Dasheng's eyes as he said leisurely, "Since you have made this person so suspenseful, then I, Lu Dasheng, cannot help but want to pay a visit to see if that person is as powerful as you say."
<br><br>"Master Lu, I'm afraid this is not very convenient, Mr. He stepped into the mortal world only to feel the life of ordinary people, so he does not like to be disturbed." Old Ancestor Qing Shan hurriedly explained.
<br><br>"If you say so, then I have to see it even if I don't see it."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng raised the corner of his mouth, while the table next to him instantly turned into powder, and at the same time, a mighty pressure pressed towards the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>Seeing this, Lu Qingshan clenched his teeth and a drop of cold sweat overflowed from his forehead, but still insisted, "Master Lu, it really won't work."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng was furious and swept out of the room with an arrow step, instantly coming next to Luo Lanxue who was waiting outside, a terrifying pressure enveloped him, his palm became a claw and tightly gripped Luo Lanxue's neck.
<br><br>Seeing this, the old ancestor of Castle Peak, who came closely behind, shouted, "Stop."
<br><br>"Huh." Lu Dasheng sneered, "Then I would like to ask you, are you taking me to meet that so-called gentleman you are talking about?"
<br><br>For a moment, the old ancestor of Castle Peak was caught in a dilemma.
<br><br>"Hmm?" The force of Rudasheng's palm tightened by two points and said in a deep voice: "Don't worry, I'm only looking for him to get the Flame Pearl, nothing else."
<br><br>"Okay, fine!"
<br><br>Looking at Luo Lanxue's increasingly difficult breathing, Old Ancestor Qingshan had no choice but to lower his head.
<br><br>"In that case, when I'm done with the matter at hand, after five days, you bring me to see him." Lu Dasheng sneered, and only then did he let go of Luo Lanxue in his hands.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan nodded with an ugly face.
<br><br>The expression was full of helplessness.
<br><br>I just hope that you, sir, will not blame me for bringing someone to break your purity!
