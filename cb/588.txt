Yi Feng walked on the way back, his mind has been thinking about bringing people over.
<br><br>One is the competition so many people, they are the lowest level of human immortal. Shadow Island kind of ghost place are not able to use cultivation okay. He has a pull full force value and wilderness survival ability.
<br><br>Those then powerful big brother, the tiger fell into the sun can only be bullied by him.
<br><br>But this is not the same outside, everyone can use cultivation, not only to fight, but also to grab.
<br><br>Of the thousands of people, he is the weakest.
<br><br>Who knows what will happen if you are not careful.
<br><br>The reward or whatever is second, the small life is more important.
<br><br>Of course, if you can quietly bring a person, reincarnation realm it, and the Sun Moon Sect peak cultivation are about the same, in a group of disciples inside want to get the first is not as simple as a bag.
<br><br>Furthermore ...... Guo Shijie that than is not a good stubble, they messed with him, has been his eyes.
<br><br>Will certainly find the opportunity to get their own.
<br><br>He obviously felt Guo Shijie's killing intent towards him before. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After thinking about it, Yi Feng firmly decided what he wanted to do.
<br><br>Back to Shadow Island, bring people over as helpers.
<br><br>The first to strike is strong, the second to suffer.
<br><br>Of course, you can also try by the way this often pit his system reliable or not. In case you can only be their own teleportation, can not bring people it.
<br><br>Then his tail can not be too high in the future to do outside.
<br><br>Yi Feng opened the system, between the turn of thought people disappeared.
<br><br>Dark Shadow Island, the courtyard.
<br><br>Gong Chen guarded the courtyard door and sat, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him out of thin air.
<br><br>Seeing that the person coming was Yi Feng, his eyes lit up and he said excitedly, "The Lord is back!"
<br><br>Lord?
<br><br>What a lofty and bullish name!
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at Gong Chen and saw his respectful appearance.
<br><br>In his heart, he was happy, but it was really a good name.
<br><br>He straightened his body, standing with his hands in the air, making himself look worthy of such a prestigious title.
<br><br>"Well, where are the others?"
<br><br>The words fell, and a bunch of people hurried out of the courtyard.
<br><br>"Ya, the Lord has returned!"
<br><br>"See you, Lord!" A bunch of people bowed to Yi Feng.
<br><br>This respectful appearance and such a forced address made Yi Feng extremely satisfied, and his face did not hold back a happy color, nodding, "Well, not bad."
<br><br>The Lord has praised them?
<br><br>All the people were happy and looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>No, can't let them know that they are happy because of this name.
<br><br>Otherwise the compulsion would be lost.
<br><br>So Yi Feng pointed to the greenery in the backyard, "These are good ones planted inside the yard."
<br><br>"Thank you, Lord, for the compliment!" The group of people in those backyards happily answered. They were all delighted at Yi Feng's praise.
<br><br>Only Gong Chen was not among these joys.
<br><br>So he hurriedly went up and added: "Lord, the person you gave me instructions to recruit before, I found another woman. Reincarnation realm, good character, tough person."
<br><br>"Not bad." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, Gong Chen was also happy, "Thank you, Lord, for the compliment!"
<br><br>"Then I'll have her come to meet the Lord now?" Gong Chen asked.
<br><br>"No need." Yi Feng waved his hand, "I don't have time to see her now. Let her come over by herself, make an oath, and stay here."
<br><br>"Yes." Gong Chen answered and added, "That woman has been eroded by the Dark Shadow Island, she has not eaten or drunk for a long time, her body is weak, Lord see, should we let her eat something?"
<br><br>"It's normal to be injured in this Dark Shadow Island." Yi Feng also did not feel anything wrong, directly said: "Stay here after making the oath, let her eat something to get well first."
<br><br>"Yes!" Gong Chen said, "I will personally keep an eye on it."
<br><br>"You don't need to keep an eye on it." Yi Feng said, "You have to go out with me, there are other things for you."
<br><br>Go out?
<br><br>Gong Chen thought he had heard wrong and looked at Yi Feng with round eyes in shock, "Lord is taking me out?!"
<br><br>"Yes." Yi Feng looked at Gong Chen, he understood Gong Chen's excitement very well.
<br><br>A place like Dark Shadow Island, where birds don't shit, is the exile place of the immortal world, similar to death row.
<br><br>Even the most powerful big brother could only wait for death when he came in, he could not get out at all.
<br><br>A trash human immortal like yourself can only rely on the system to get in and out.
<br><br>Gong Chen could only wait for death here, can follow himself out of the Shadow Island, naturally will be very happy.
<br><br>This point of the system is good, just to give yourself the skills to play hard to get in front of these big guys.
<br><br>However,...... Yi Feng had a thought floating in his head.
<br><br>He calmly looked at the excited Gong Chen and did not speak.
<br><br>Gong Chen was Yi Feng looked at his scalp, are afraid to get excited. Very apprehensively, he inquired, "What is the Lord looking at me for?"
<br><br>"I am thinking that I can take you out and also bring you back." Yi Feng said calmly, and the words were indeed majestic.
<br><br>"So when you go out, you can't have other thoughts."
<br><br>That's right, he was afraid that Gong Chen would run the ball after being taken out by himself.
<br><br>After all, for people like them who have been imprisoned for countless years on the dark shadow island without seeing the sun, being able to go out is a great thing that they can't even dream of.
<br><br>Set up an oath or something, the immortals value, but he himself knows very well no use.
<br><br>For being able to go out this kind of dreaming of a great good thing in the sky, who knows if there will be a little possibility to occupy his reason, so that he even set up an oath to disregard.
<br><br>A little possibility, Yi Feng can not tolerate will have.
<br><br>If you go out, to Gong Chen reincarnation realm cultivation, not to mention escape from their own easy, is to get themselves killed to destroy the body is also easy to do.
<br><br>This is the naked knock ah!
<br><br>Gong Chen heard the words, where there is still a half-excited.
<br><br>"Poof" a kneeling down, "the Lord understand, subordinates do not dare to and half other thoughts!"
<br><br>"If the Lord is suspicious of my loyalty, then I will not go out!" Gong Chen said frightened, raised his palm to the sky, "Not only that, I'll show my allegiance by ruining my whole body cultivation!"
<br><br>He said he was about to slash down at the sky spirit cover.
<br><br>"Stop!" Yi Feng hurried to stop.
<br><br>This is also too radical, they are only questioning the need to abolish their ......
<br><br>A turn of the brain explained, "You think too much. I am not suspicious of you, just afraid that you go out because too excited to delay the things I ordered."
<br><br>But to be honest, seeing Gong Chen look like this, Yi Feng was really completely relieved.
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, Gong Chen also let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>He wiped the fine sweat on his forehead, "Lord, don't worry, although I am indeed excited to go out, but ten thousand cannot and dare not delay the main business of the Lord!"
<br><br>"That's good." Yi Feng said, went forward to still kneeling Gong Chen helped up, "first get up."
<br><br>Gong Chen obeyed Yi Feng's support and got up trembling, after the panic, his heart began to think about Yi Feng's matter.
<br><br>"Lord, if I go out with you and that Reincarnation Realm woman comes over, what should I do?" He inquired.
<br><br>Yi Feng swept over with a glance and saw the farmer-like man standing at the front of the pile of people carrying a hoe.
<br><br>"What's your name again?"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng ask his name, coupled with the topic just now, Dai Cang's voice trembled with excitement.
<br><br>"Back to the Lord, my subordinate Dai Cang."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him and thought for a moment, "Did you turn the soil in the complex backyard before?"
<br><br>"Exactly!"
<br><br>"After Gong Chen left with me, you can be competent in his affairs, right?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Of course!" Dai Cang responded with excitement.
<br><br>"Good, then after I leave you complicated to manage the affairs and people in the courtyard." Yi Feng instructed, "And the woman Gong Chen said, you even dispose of her affairs properly."
<br><br>"Yes! My subordinate will not disgrace the mission!" Dai Cang pounded the hoe into the ground and returned firmly and loudly.
<br><br>Yi Feng took out his ears, looking at Dai Cang's incomparable solemn appearance, some want to laugh.
<br><br>A broken courtyard inside a few digging and weeding, they are only a human immortal salty fish, but can make a whole world of the Lord of the forced out.
<br><br>It is true that the pattern of powerful big brother is different.
<br><br>Unlike the old man who picked the dung and turned the soil in his martial arts school, unlike the salted fish disciples and recruited subordinates in his Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>You just chewed up with them to express their greatness, but also two eyes blank, lightly said, Mr. really great.
<br><br>"Well, then I'm leaving. Here's the thing, I'll leave it to you guys." Yi Feng said, the words fell, grabbed Gong Chen in his hand and disappeared in place.
<br><br>A group of people dumbfounded, looking at the flat ground disappeared Yi Feng dumbfounded.
<br><br>Outside such an instant is not difficult, but the Shadow Island such a place, not only is the suppression of cultivation extremely desolate dead, outside there are ten thousand years of the void boundary.
<br><br>They originally thought that the Lord could go out, how to cast a spell first, and then use cultivation to leave.
<br><br>I did not expect just an instant ...... is gone ......
<br><br>The crowd could not help but sigh up, "know that the Lord is very strong, did not expect to be strong to such, simply terrifying as this!"
<br><br>"Yes. But Gong Chen is so lucky, the first one to go out is him." Someone also sighed.
<br><br>"That's nothing, you didn't see how easy it was for the Lord to take him out. Just grab it and swoosh and it's gone!"
<br><br>"As long as we serve the Lord well, the Lord will take us out sooner or later. What's your hurry."
<br><br>"Yes." Dai Cang also nodded in agreement, "Such a powerful character like the Lord appeared out of nowhere, yet he has never heard of his name in the immortal world."
<br><br>"Now suddenly appeared, may be what ancient great power, out of the mountain layout to plan great things. It's impossible to stay in this shitless Shadow Island all the time."
<br><br>"That makes sense." The people next to you have responded.
<br><br>The woman with the vegetable basket smiled and interjected, "Before you said that Gong Chen is lucky, your luck is not bad either. This is a promotion, maybe it won't be long before you can be like Gong Chen."
<br><br>"I also don't know when I will be able to be like you guys and win the favor."
<br><br>Dai Cang smiled and couldn't hold back the smile on his face, "That's not true, Gong Chen is now a big hit in front of the Lord, how can I compare to him."
<br><br>"All let you in charge, you are also a red person." The sound of congratulations came from the side, all echoing the approval.
<br><br>Dai Cang laughed so hard that he could hardly close his mouth, but he didn't forget the business.
<br><br>"Okay, okay, you guys go and do your own thing, I'm going to finish the Lord's orders." Dai Cang waved his hand and headed off into the wind and sand.
