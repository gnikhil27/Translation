Thinking of this, he rode slowly towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"I can't imagine that I misunderstood you this time, dog system!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on the shell of slowly, hands grabbed the tentacles on the top of the head, could not help but say: "The speed is not slow, similar to a small electric donkey, the key is still amphibious, except for sitting up a little diaphragm butt, really quite practical."
<br><br>This time, he went to Pingjiang City because he wanted to look for Lu Qingshan again to ask about the qualification of building a sect.
<br><br>When he came to the entrance of Pingjiang City, Yi Feng slowly put it away.
<br><br>After all, this kind of thing, it is better not to attract people's attention.
<br><br>Coincidentally, at the entrance of Pingjiang City Yi Feng ran into Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan was also excited to see Yi Feng, and hurriedly saluted.
<br><br>"Don't be polite old man, I came to ask you things."
<br><br>Yi Feng put his arm on Lu Qingshan's shoulder, pulled him to the side and asked softly, "Old man, last time you said the qualification for building a sect, what is needed to come?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Sir, in order to maintain the balance of power on the continent and reduce chaos, so every region has a body composed of all major sects, and to build a sect you need to get permission from this body to do so."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan patiently explained, "And in fact, this permission is also very simple, that is, the person who builds the sect either has a minimum Martial Master cultivation, or this person who builds the sect has a resume of having been a disciple in other sects at a minimum."
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>This is really easy for cultivators, but for him, it's hard as hell!
<br><br>Stroking his chin, he couldn't help but ask again, "By the way, what will happen if you private the clan without getting the qualification?"
<br><br>"This well ......"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan said with slight hesitation: "Then it will be punished by the institution and directly obliterated!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously shivered.
<br><br>It seems to want to speculate and sneak around to engage is not possible ah!
<br><br>After all, this kind of institution is all the sects together to organize, he can not afford to provoke.
<br><br>And to have a minimum martial arts cultivation, he could not possibly, so after doing the math, he could only take his chances and see if a blind sect would recruit him.
<br><br>"Thanks a lot old man."
<br><br>Yi Feng then prepared to rush back.
<br><br>But just two steps away remembered something, looked back at Lu Qingshan, and hurriedly asked, "By the way old man, what are you doing here?"
<br><br>"Ah, uh ...... I'm here ......"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan obsequiously.
<br><br>He came to this city gate is not for no reason, but someone contacted him, there are two kitten girl to exchange with him, after all, he mouth this bite is not.
<br><br>Who knew that here ran into Yi Feng.
<br><br>But this kind of thing how to be able to say it in front of Mr., which called Mr. how to see him?
<br><br>So he swallowed and stammered, a long time also did not say a reason.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>It was Yi Feng who sighed and saw the difficulty of Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>He has been in Pingjiang City for so long, he still does not know what this place is for?
<br><br>This is a recruitment point, every day there will be a lot of bottom people will come here to find things to do, and some mine bosses ah, or some other hard work stewards will come here to recruit workers.
<br><br>So Lu Qingshan came here obviously.
<br><br>Must be looking for work.
<br><br>Plus he knows that Lu Qingshan is very poor, and also to support a niece to cultivate, can certainly be eight or nine is not far from the truth.
<br><br>But then Lu Qingshan good face, they are poor and embarrassed to say it in front of him, afraid that they look down on him, I'm afraid to be so coy.
<br><br>Poor people, really hard ah.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he patted Lu Qingshan's shoulder and said softly: "Old man, there is nothing difficult to say, this kind of thing, ah, I understand!"
<br><br>"You understand, sir?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan shivered.
<br><br>Could not help but wipe a sweat.
<br><br>Sir is sir, even this kind of thing is known to him?
<br><br>"Of course I understand." Yi Feng sighed with emotion, then said with a cautionary tone: "But this kind of thing hurts the body, especially you are so old, can not carry?"
<br><br>Yi Feng is also right.
<br><br>Hard work which does not hurt the body?
<br><br>Especially when Lu Qingshan is so old.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan fiercely planted his head, his face immediately rose with the pig liver.
