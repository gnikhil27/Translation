"The Martial Emperor is summoned by the Immortal Realm and must travel to the Immortal Realm Transmission Formation in the Central State of the Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"To the Immortal Realm Teleportation Formation, there will be an Immortal Realm messenger to guide the way."
<br><br>After reading these two lines, Yi Feng closed the book he was holding.
<br><br>Taking a deep breath, he put down the book and turned around to walk outside.
<br><br>After a hundred days of seclusion, Yi Feng came out of seclusion.
<br><br>A year can not have a few hundred days.
<br><br>He did not want to waste time in the really give himself to the soul to fly broken.
<br><br>Although to the immortal world, himself and the immortal continent of the mortal may be similar, but at least also considered to have cultivation.
<br><br>And now he is also able to cultivate.
<br><br>At least when you go to the immortal world, you won't be at the bottom.
<br><br>If, after going to the immortal world, he can still only be a loser, then he will be one word throughout his life - Gou! One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After Yi Feng came out of the gate, he released slowly.
<br><br>He rode on slowly and gathered the few people from the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>Today was the big day that Yi Feng came out of the gate. Everyone from the Heaven and Earth Sect came in Mu body and stood respectfully below.
<br><br>"All of you, from today, I am going to leave here temporarily." A majestic voice came from above.
<br><br>The huge snail pressed the crowd so much that they could not raise their heads, and could only bow their heads and listen to the teachings.
<br><br>"After I leave, this Heaven and Earth Gate, I'll leave it to you all to watch over it for me." He said.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Riding slowly, Yi Feng headed towards the teleportation formation to enter the Immortal World.
<br><br>Yi Feng lay on the snail and dozed off.
<br><br>It was woken up by a noisy sound.
<br><br>He opened his drowsy eyes, and before the person could see clearly, his ears heard chattering voices next to him.
<br><br>"You said that when you get to the immortal world, everyone is very powerful, right?"
<br><br>"That's not necessarily true. If an immortal gets married to an immortal, the son born can't be born immortal, right?"
<br><br>"That makes sense, hahaha. In that case, it's not necessarily the worst for us to go."
<br><br>Yi Feng propped himself up from the snail and saw a group of people standing in the teleportation array, some excited, some excited, some yearning.
<br><br>As for the downcast and expressionless, he was the only one.
<br><br>The dozen people standing in the formation were also attracted by the sudden appearance of the snail, after all, a snail as a mount is still rare.
<br><br>But also just a few glances.
<br><br>"Stop chatting, stop chatting, the immortal messenger is here!" Someone next to him made a sound to stop it.
<br><br>The clamor of voices suddenly quieted down.
<br><br>At the same time, a white-haired old man appeared out of nowhere next to the teleportation array.
<br><br>He looked at the crowd from a high position.
<br><br>"I am the messenger of the Immortal World, and I have come to guide you all to the Immortal World today."
<br><br>The white-haired old man stood in the air and slowly said, "The Immortal Realm is different from the Immortal River Continent, the laws are not the same."
<br><br>"You may be able to break space with one punch here and cross ten thousand miles in one step. But when you get to the Immortal Realm, it's impossible."
<br><br>"There, space is fixed ten thousand times and gravity is ten thousand times heavier, so you are in the Immortal Realm, equivalent to the lowest cultivation martial artist in the Immortal River Continent. Can not fly, only when you reach the Heavenly Immortal can fly."
<br><br>Yi Feng listened below with a frown.
<br><br>He lowered his head and looked at his fondling fingers.
<br><br>Damn, it was so easy to get away for a while, and now it was the trashiest again.
<br><br>The messenger from above continued; "Originally, the Immortal River Continent was under the jurisdiction of the Qingyu Immortal Continent, and you were supposed to teleport to the Qingyun Continent."
<br><br>"But some time ago, a mysterious person's fist broke the sky and knocked out five hundred black holes in the Immortal Continent. And one of the black holes is in the Qingyu Immortal Continent, and the entire Qingyu Immortal Continent is fragmented, and the space and its instability are now."
<br><br>"So you will not go to the Qingyu Immortal Continent anymore, but will be randomly transported to various parts of the Immortal Realm."
<br><br>As the words fell, the dozen people below turned pale with fear.
<br><br>Even if not on the heart like Yi Feng, also scared to squeeze the fingers.
<br><br>A single punch broke the sky and shattered the immortal realm, this is simply terrifying as hell!
<br><br>"Dare to ask the messenger, who is this person?" Someone couldn't help but speak up, his voice all tinged with fear, "To break the heavens by five hundred black holes!"
<br><br>The messenger raised his hand, stopping the annoying whispers in the field.
<br><br>"These things are not for people of your level to know." He said.
<br><br>"Alright, I will now activate the teleportation array, and this will teleport all of you to the Immortal Realm one by one."
<br><br>As the words fell, the entire teleportation array began to rotate, and there was a circle of light pillar descending from the sky under the gesture of the white-haired old man, which soon enveloped the pattern floating in the center of the array.
<br><br>One by one, they stood into the floating pattern.
<br><br>A flash of light column radical awning, in which people will disappear.
<br><br>Each one went in, all more or less with anticipation and delight.
<br><br>Only the last one Yi Feng.
<br><br>Slate face reluctantly stood on the light pillar.
<br><br>A flash of light, he, along with the messenger and the light formation, all disappeared.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>A burst of heavenly spinning brakes swept toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>All things in the world pass in a flash.
<br><br>Yi Feng was in the middle of it, time like a white horse flashed past in front of his eyes.
<br><br>Time, I do not know how long has passed.
<br><br>Yi Feng felt a glimmer of light in the middle of the teleportation channel.
<br><br>Then the line of sight changed and he landed on a continent he had never seen before.
<br><br>Just after he landed, a whirlwind swept by wildly, and the sand squinted his eyes.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly reached out to block it.
<br><br>After a moment, only then slowly lowered his arm and swept his gaze across where he was.
<br><br>Completely frozen.
<br><br>This fucking ...... is the so-called immortal world ？？？？
<br><br>Outrageous ah!!!
