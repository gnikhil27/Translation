But just as he approached, his eyes glazed over and almost burst straight out.
<br><br>It was as if he had seen something fearful, and his body was covered in cold sweat.
<br><br>The body cut through a perfect arc in mid-air and exerted an unprecedented speed to flee towards the distance.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He had just flown half a dozen feet when he suddenly winced, and at the same time a force acted on his body, pulling him towards the back.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>He hit the ground heavily.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng was in the mood to die at this moment, and actually ran into this terrifying existence again.
<br><br>But he didn't dare to have the slightest complaint in his heart, so he climbed up and said with a smile on his face, "Seniors, seniors, what a coincidence, we meet again."
<br><br>"It's you again?"
<br><br>A gloomy voice came from under the black robe, apparently also recognized Lu Dasheng. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, it's me."
<br><br>Rudaseng wiped his cold sweat and stammered.
<br><br>"Then you really have a lot of guts!" The black-robed man's voice sank, and as his voice fell, an absolute pressure of might acted directly on Rudasheng's body, saying coldly, "It seems that the lesson given to you last time was not enough!"
<br><br>At these words, Lu Dasheng's body shivered with fear.
<br><br>After he recovered, he waved his hands and explained sharply with a crying face: "Elder, you misunderstood, you misunderstood, I was really passing by this time!"
<br><br>"Do you believe it?"
<br><br>The black robe looked at the dog at his feet.
<br><br>The dog shook his head desperately.
<br><br>"Then what to do with it?" The black robed man asked again.
<br><br>"Sincerity?" The dog narrowed his eyes and said.
<br><br>"Mm!" The black-robed man nodded solemnly, then turned his gaze to Rudasheng and said soberly, "It's okay to let you go, depending on whether you have sincerity or not."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng said with a shivering voice, and hurriedly opened his storage ring and took out a large pile of Pin Pills.
<br><br>"Just this?"
<br><br>Looking at these pills, a disdainful voice was revealed under the black robe, and at the same time an even stronger pressure acted towards Rudaseng.
<br><br>Under this powerful pressure, Lu Dasheng prostrated on the ground, scared guts are about to break, no longer dare to hide anything, directly take out the storage ring.
<br><br>Sleeve a stretch, the storage ring will fall to Ao Qing.
<br><br>"Qing ah, see how it is."
<br><br>"Good brother."
<br><br>Ao Qing opened the storage ring, then said, "Brother, there is nothing good for you, but some things are quite useful for me."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>The black-robed man was surprised, "Then in that case, this storage ring is for you."
<br><br>"Aigoo thank you brother, brother you are really handsome, profoundly righteous, flooded with blessings, wise and overwhelming, heroic and extraordinary, longevity than the South Mountain ......" the dog excitedly put away the storage ring and praised it one after another.
<br><br>This a raging storm, so that the black-robed man slightly raised his head.
<br><br>Then with a wave of his palm, he barked at Lu Dasheng: "Get lost!"
<br><br>At that, Lu Dasheng showed a look of relief, said thanks and drew his legs to run.
<br><br>"Brother, I think his black robe material is good, I think if you wear this black robe, it will be more wise and powerful." The dog looked at the black robe on Rudasheng's body and said attentively.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>The black-robed man looked down at the black robe on his body, and then looked at the black robe on Lu Dasheng's body, nodded and said, "It's true."
<br><br>After saying that, he reached his palm towards Rudaseng and grabbed him.
<br><br>"Come back!"
<br><br>This is poor Lu Dasheng, just ran a few steps before a sigh of relief, this grasp simply forced his eyes out of tears, prostrate on the ground shivering: "Senior, you, what else you command."
<br><br>"Clothes, take them off!" The black-robed man said without question.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng's eyes widened.
<br><br>"Ah what ah?"
<br><br>The black-robed man waved his palm, Lu Dasheng only felt a cool sensation coming from his body, chill, the clothes on his body then had reached the hands of the black-robed man.
<br><br>"Ouch, senior you, rob my things even if, why do you have to be so humiliating ah!" Finally, Lu Dasheng full of aggression erupted, clamping his legs with one hand over the buttocks, the other hand over the finch shouted.
<br><br>However, in addition to an empty recliner in front of him, the man and the wolf had long disappeared.
<br><br>"Woo!"
<br><br>"Undeserved disaster, really undeserved disaster ah!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng want to cry, turned his head to look around, desolate even a leaf can not be found, had to step on the small broken step a fierce step in the air, play an unprecedented speed towards the Castle Peak Gate rushed.
<br><br>And at the same time, rushed back Lu Qingshan and other people in a row, also finally returned to the Castle Peak Gate mountain gate.
<br><br>"Someone!"
<br><br>Zhu Yun shouted fiercely.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the Castle Peak Ancestors fiercely turned their gazes towards the distance and could clearly perceive that there was a powerful fluctuation towards the direction of the Castle Peak Sect, sweeping in at an extremely fast speed.
<br><br>"Is it an enemy attack?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun asked nervously.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak also frowned, his body's Yuan Qi had been turned around, and the group was waiting for the approach of that powerful fluctuation.
