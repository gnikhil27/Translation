 "Uh uh uh, okay okay okay, go go go." Yi Feng waved his hand impatiently, he couldn't stand the old man's middle-aged air a bit and hurriedly sent him away.
<br><br>After sending old man Wu away, Yi Feng continued to return to his desk.
<br><br>The next time, he was immersed in the book "Purple Haze Fairy and the Supreme Treasure", the whole day behind closed doors.
<br><br>And with the complete arrival of autumn, the autumn wind outside the street is getting more and more sluggish, but also can not affect Yi Feng. Even the bone-chilling cold air, in the small sun against, Yi Feng is not afraid.
<br><br>It seems that this year's Yi Feng, can live a comfortable winter.
<br><br>Zhong Qing is still the same silent color, daily hard practice boxing, while busy with the martial arts school in the size of the household matters.
<br><br>Ao Qing, the second dog, is lying at Yi Feng's feet, the body's injuries have long recovered completely, occasionally look at Yi Feng boxing, and occasionally observe the pictures in the front room of the martial arts school, the strength is surprisingly rapid progress.
<br><br>This day, the old ancestor of Castle Peak came to visit.
<br><br>When he came, he seemed to have something on his mind, Yi Feng saw his state and moved out some chicken soup from his previous life to comfort him a bit.
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't know if it was of any use, but he only knew that Old Ancestor Qingshan left full of confidence.
<br><br>The next day. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng finished a set of Taijiquan, stretched his back, and was ready to hit the streets for some wine, but found that the streets were much colder today than before.
<br><br>"What's going on?" Yi Feng went to sit at the beef stall across the street and asked, "Usually you will also see some disciples of cultivation shopping on the street, how come it is so cold today."
<br><br>"I'm afraid Master Yi still doesn't know, right?" The boy saw Yi Feng carrying wine in his hand, generously got him two or two beef plate on, then looked at the distant sky and said: "Today is the day of the duel between the old ancestor of Castle Peak and the old ancestor of Xuanwu, cultivators are rushing to see their battle, the battle at the top, after all, this can be about the life and death of the two sects ah!"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, for the cultivators of things he really does not care much, but this thing seems to have heard of before.
<br><br>After eating two taels of beef at the boy and drinking two taels of strong wine, he rushed back to the martial arts school with a warm body and continued to write with his pen.
<br><br>......
<br><br>There is a natural canyon between the Green Mountain Sect and the Xuanwu Sect, and in the middle of the canyon there is a platform with a thousand feet range, which is the Wind and Rain Platform.
<br><br>The wind and rain platform.
<br><br>The Qing Shan Old Ancestor's eyes were blazing and his aura exploded.
<br><br>The Xuanwu Ancestor has white hair and a cold smile flashes on his face.
<br><br>On the two sides of the canyon, one side was filled with disciples of the Xuanwu Sect, while the other side was filled with disciples of the Qingshan Sect, all with a look of concentration on their faces.
<br><br>The battle between the two was about the future of all of them.
<br><br>"Qingshan, I never thought you would really dare to come?" Old Man Xuanwu said teasingly.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan snorted coldly and did not have much to say.
<br><br>"Suffer death!"
<br><br>The two did not seem to have much foreplay either, Xuan Wu's body aura was revealed, like lightning swept up into the mid-air, and then Phi's palm slapped down towards the Castle Peak Old Ancestor.
<br><br>This moment, the power of the Martial King realm in the hands of Xuan Wu undoubtedly.
<br><br>Before the attack arrived, the rock beneath the old ancestor's feet had already clicked and cracked, like a spider web spreading.
<br><br>Not willing to lag behind, the same aura burst out, the palm of his foot chopped the ground, the ground appeared a large crater, lightning-like body towards this palm print to meet.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>A heaven-defying sound resounded over the stormy platform.
<br><br>Numerous qi energy spread out in all directions, and the disciples watching from afar could not help but push back one after another under this strong qi energy.
<br><br>Two Martial King experts, the strength is really terrifying as this.
<br><br>But the crowd could not care less about the retreating body, eyes like pinholes overhead, also want to know, the two old ancestors of the first strike collision, which is stronger or weaker.
<br><br>It is to see, among the qi energy, a figure wretched in mid-air backwards hundreds of feet.
<br><br>It is the old ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>Seeing this, the faces of the people of the Castle Peak Sect collectively sank.
<br><br>In the crowd, Peng Ying's face is white, clutching the jade hand, she has joined the Castle Peak Sect for some time, understand the significance of this battle, is she so easy to join the Castle Peak Sect, to face the situation of the fall of the Castle Peak Sect?
<br><br>The Xuanwu Sect, on the other hand, was different, and immediately let out a startling applause.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, Qingshan, you really are a waste, next year's today will be the anniversary of your death." In mid-air, Old Ancestor Xuanwu burst out laughing, with a strong look of teasing on his face.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan's face looked ugly when he heard that, the gap between the two of them was really big!
<br><br>"Die!" Xuanwu Old Ancestor obviously knows the truth of beating a dog in the water, without too much delay, ghostly swept up into the mid-air, a heaven-destroying palm slapped towards Castle Peak Old Ancestor again.
<br><br>This palm.
<br><br>Than the last palm more powerful, more fierce momentum.
<br><br>If the old ancestor Qingshan only just showed the kind of strength, facing the old ancestor Xuanwu's palm he will not die or seriously injured.
<br><br>The palm print shrouded in Yuan Qi in the sky bigger and bigger, illuminating half the sky, but also closer and closer to the Old Ancestor Qingshan.
<br><br>But the old ancestor of Castle Peak, but not the slightest movement.
<br><br>Seeing this, many outsiders watching the battle have shaken their heads, and many more speculate that this is the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak knows that he is no match and has given up resistance.
<br><br>In particular, the crowd of the Castle Peak Gate, but also a deadly gray face.
<br><br>This palm down, seems to have seen the sight of the destruction of the Castle Peak Gate.
<br><br>When the palm print was less than thirty feet away from the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, a cold smile suddenly appeared on the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak's face, and then he fished out a kitchen knife from his pocket.
<br><br>"Finally, it's my turn."
