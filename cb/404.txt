The words just fell.
<br><br>Outside the door came a knocking sound.
<br><br>This abrupt knocking sound, directly let the courtyard turned dead silent, the sound of falling leaves in this moment also became clear to the ear.
<br><br>The crowd looked at each other.
<br><br>Who would knock on the door at this time?
<br><br>Just when the crowd was wondering, the knocking sounded again, and at the same time came out a voice.
<br><br>"Miss White, do you hear me, are you there?"
<br><br>This voice came like an explosive thunderstorm in their minds.
<br><br>"No, no, no, no, no way."
<br><br>Yun Lan even shivered, almost scaring the piss out of him.
<br><br>"I clearly rearranged the formation, how could this kid still find his way over, this is simply impossible!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yun Lan face ugly shaking his head, heart completely unable to accept this fact, mouth murmuring at the same time, an arrow step towards the door.
<br><br>White Peopeo's mind was also unable to calm down, and quickly followed Yun Lan.
<br><br>"It must be an illusion."
<br><br>Yun Lan's lips trembled, her heart comforted herself like this, and then pulled open the door.
<br><br>The door opened.
<br><br>A white-robed figure appeared in the eyes of the crowd.
<br><br>It was none other than Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yi Gongzi, it's really you, how come you're back again?" Bai Piao Piao saw that it was really Yi Feng immediately emitted an excited voice, and hurriedly greeted towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>On the side of Yun Lan looked at Yi Feng's face, but directly collapsed.
<br><br>Both hands deadly yanked their hair, staggering paws back legs, heart full of unbelievable.
<br><br>At the same time, his face was red, and a hot pain came.
<br><br>He just vowed to pat his chest and white floating said, unless the immortals in the sky can find here, in the twinkling of an eye, this abominable guy came to the door.
<br><br>This face.
<br><br>Hit also too much pain.
<br><br>You say he is really strong is just, at least Yun Lan can also speak a pair of rhetoric vague past, not so humiliating.
<br><br>But the damn thing is, this guy is a mortal, fucking mortal ah!
<br><br>The most most irritating thing is that this is not the first time, but the second time.
<br><br>For a moment, a mouthful of old blood almost spat out from Yun Lan's mouth.
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>Why was this abominable guy able to break his formations so often, why on earth!
<br><br>Yun Lan roared inwardly, wanting to grab Yi Feng and ask him directly for an explanation.
<br><br>Just at that moment, Bai Piao Piao's warning gaze looked over.
<br><br>At the same time, her voice transmission fell into Yun Lan's mind.
<br><br>"Protector Yun, how was Duke Yi able to come here twice, I think you should ask not about him, but should reflect on the problems in yourselves."
<br><br>"Anyway, I'll put my words here today, Duke Yi is my friend, I definitely won't allow you guys to hurt him, and if anything happens to him, I will definitely not cooperate with you guys!"
<br><br>The nail-biting words came out from Bai Piao Piao's mouth, full of power.
<br><br>At those words, Yun Lan's face rose ugly.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Ugh ......"
<br><br>Wanted to refute something, but remembered his previous vow immediately and was hit in the face, at this moment he also did not have the face to confront with Bai Piao Piao, only to sigh heavily, angrily flung his robe sleeves and go.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi, why are you back again?" After Yun Lan left, Bai Piao Piao couldn't help but ask towards Yi Feng, "Could it be that the matter is finished?"
<br><br>"The matter is not finished, I came back because my money bag seems to have fallen at your place."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled embarrassedly and jogged towards the guest room next to him.
<br><br>"Did you drop your money bag?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao nodded and was about to follow Yi Feng.
<br><br>But at this moment, she suddenly remembered something and her footsteps lurched.
<br><br>Her pretty face, too, changed dramatically!
<br><br>Without saying a word, she quickly followed Yi Feng and stopped him in his place: "Sir Yi doesn't need to be in such a hurry, right?"
<br><br>"Which can not be anxious, that is several hundred gold coins."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly bypassed Bai Piaoqiao and continued to rush towards the guest room.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao seems to have some untold secret discovered, once again stopped in front of Yi Feng and said, "It should be unlikely to fall in this room, or not easy to go to other places to look first?"
<br><br>"If this room is not there, it is even more unlikely to be elsewhere." Yi Feng said, once again bypassing Bai Piao Piao, pushed open the door and walked in towards the room.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao turned bloodless and had to follow Yi Feng again to the bed.
<br><br>At the same time, she prayed secretly in her heart, "Never, never be discovered!"
<br><br>"Huh, this bed, I remember when I left, did not all the quilts sorted out?" Yi Feng asked in confusion.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao heart a thud.
<br><br>Reacting, he forced a smile and explained awkwardly, "Maybe, maybe you remembered wrongly, gongzi."
<br><br>"Wow."
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his head, didn't care much, and searched the bed.
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piao Piao patted her proud little chest and let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She this breath has not completely breathed down, in the bed to look for the money bag Yi Feng, from the quilt inside to feel what.
<br><br>Once pulled out ......
<br><br>It was a set of black female pajamas.
<br><br>Pajamas fabric seems to be very expensive, feel silky smooth, feel excellent, only very thin, a little transparent, even if just grabbed in the hand, you can clearly smell a faint fresh fragrance.
<br><br>"How can there be women's clothes on this bed?"
<br><br>Yi Feng grasped this pajamas and looked his puzzled gaze at Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao froze in place like a pillar, her delicate face instantly reddened to the root of her neck, her jade hands tugged green, her red lips clenched, about to bite out blood.
<br><br>I can't wait to find a crack in the ground, but also full of remorse for themselves.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao ah Bai Piao Piao, how did you forget to put away the pajamas you changed last night?
<br><br>If Mr. Yi found out that I secretly slept in his bed after he left, what would he think of me?
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao you stupid woman, why so brainless ah!
<br><br>What to do what to do ......
<br><br>I'm going to die ......
