Looking at Yin Shengfu's appearance, the two people next to him had complex expressions.
<br><br>Especially Meng Li Xian.
<br><br>She and Yin Shengfu were the same.
<br><br>Originally, they both had a great opportunity, but they were buried for nothing because of their own blindness, and even Yin Shengfu broke his dao heart because of it.
<br><br>If she couldn't get out, I'm afraid that's all Yin Shengfu will achieve in this life.
<br><br>The entrance to the Land of Chaos.
<br><br>In the sky, there are two figures standing in the air, a man and a woman.
<br><br>The female has a long black dress.
<br><br>The male was about sixty years old and dressed in a daoist robe.
<br><br>"That Zhong Qing, what on earth is wrong with you that the anger is so deep?" The old man in the dao robe couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Smell the words. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The black-clothed woman's pretty face sank, and her eyes flashed with a strong cold intent.
<br><br>Thinking about the scene that happened a few days ago, she hated to make her kill someone directly.
<br><br>She saw Zhong Qing left alone in Hanchang City, originally thought that the heavenly opportunity she disguised to approach Zhong Qing, wanting to use it to find out the fact that Zhong Qing is not a god body or not.
<br><br>But the hateful thing is.
<br><br>The straight man, Zhong Qing, not only ignored her, but even fed her a face of dog food in front of her and Yun Mengtian.
<br><br>What's even more annoying is that the damned brat also took a mouthful of a big mother and said in a serious tone that she should not eat young grass from an old cow, and that the two were impossible.
<br><br>This insulting language is so strong that she wanted to kill Zhong Qing directly.
<br><br>Even she, who had always been confident, questioned her own face for the first time.
<br><br>"Old Daoist Lin Mo, let me ask you, am I really old?"
<br><br>With an icy face she couldn't help but touch her pretty face and asked towards the old Daoist robed dao at the side.
<br><br>"Uh, why would you ask that?"
<br><br>Old Daoist Lin Mo couldn't help but take a step back and asked uncomfortably.
<br><br>"Answer the question when you're told to, where's all the questioning?" The woman in black said with a frosty face.
<br><br>"Uh, how can I say this ......"
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao scratched his head, but before he could speak, he found that the woman in black's hand had somehow coalesced an energy ball, surging with terrifying energy, stupidly moving.
<br><br>"Remember, think before you answer."
<br><br>The woman in black fiddled with the energy ball in her hand, carelessly glanced at Lin Mo Lao Dao and said leisurely.
<br><br>Hearing this, Lin Mo Lao Dao immediately a shiver, mouth hurriedly said: "Beautiful, beautiful to the sky."
<br><br>"Hmph, that's more or less the same."
<br><br>Only then did the woman in black nod in satisfaction and casually threw the energy ball in her hand down.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The mountains and forests for several miles in circumference were directly razed into flat land.
<br><br>Seeing this, Lin Mo Lao Dao subconsciously touched a cold sweat.
<br><br>"So what are you going to do next?"
<br><br>After catching his breath, Old Daoist Lin Mo asked again.
<br><br>"That Zhong Qing has already left Hanchang City and is preparing to come to rendezvous with that godly master of his, and according to the time, he should have already arrived at Wolong City, which is the closest to here."
<br><br>The woman in black said, "And according to the observation during this period of time, Zhong Qing only this master of his is respect, even talking to people are three sentences, so want to approach him, can only from this godly master of his."
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao nodded approvingly, then asked, "Then what do you plan to do?"
<br><br>"I would like to ask you what you think." The woman in black said.
<br><br>"How about just arresting that godly man?" Lin Mo Lao Dao said, "Then directly force him and place you by Zhong Qing's side?"
<br><br>"I've thought about this solution, but it's still not right." The black-clothed woman shook her head and said, "If Zhong Qing is really a divine body, knowing that we treat him, the divine rod master, like this, I'm afraid that he will not even die from me."
<br><br>"And this matter is too significant, we can not take such a risk!" The woman in black said solemnly.
<br><br>"Then what exactly do you plan to do?"
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao asked.
<br><br>"Now we have to solve, is by what way can stay by Zhong Qing's side, so as to find out his identity, since Zhong Qing this little son of a bitch does not understand, but his godly master can not be seen." The woman in black said leisurely.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao said in surprise.
<br><br>"Good, men, it is not just a matter of solving." The woman in black raised the corner of her mouth.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao sighed.
<br><br>Also did not expect that with their two identities, they still had to use such tricks to deal with two small mortals.
<br><br>But now, it really seemed that there was no way out.
<br><br>After all, before confirming whether Zhong Qing was a divine body identity or not, it was better to try to come from the soft side.
<br><br>"Coming out."
<br><br>At this time, the woman in black looked at the exit of the chaotic land below and said.
<br><br>Old man Lin Mo looked down.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>A white-robed youth walked out of the exit of the Land of Chaos.
<br><br>It was none other than Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched out in place, with a faint smile on his face.
<br><br>Through the voice transmission jade slip, Yi Feng knew that his young apprentice had left Hanchang City to find him, and had arrived at Wolong City not far away, which is not, he, as a master, came to pick up his apprentice.
<br><br>"I have to say, this divine rod is really powerful, even the land of chaos has run in, do you think he is really a little bit capable?" In the sky, the woman in black looked at the ground Yi Feng said leisurely.
<br><br>"Who knows, the cultivation is certainly no cultivation, the other ......" Lin Mo Lao Dao said: "When the time comes, you are close to not know."
<br><br>"All right, you go back first, the next thing to me."
<br><br>The woman in black gave an explanation, looked at Yi Feng's figure and chased after him.
