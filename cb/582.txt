"Exactly!"
<br><br>Liu Yan's subordinate replied, his gaze also full of shock.
<br><br>Thinking for a moment, Liu Yan immediately denied: "Absolutely no way."
<br><br>"I saw it with my own eyes, I don't dare to deceive the peak master!" The subordinate said categorically.
<br><br>At that, Liu Yan was silent for a while.
<br><br>I don't know what he was thinking about.
<br><br>And then looked up at the subordinate, "You really saw it with your own eyes? Are you sure it was that human immortal who practiced the One Thought Finger?"
<br><br>"It's true!" The subordinate said, added: "The first time, the subordinate in the mountain peak, saw him jumping over at the foot of the mountain, there are air currents generated, like the One Thought Finger, but thought about it also think it is impossible, and left."
<br><br>"The second time I passed by the mountain pool, I saw him jumping around next to the pool water, and the pool water exploded with a surge."
<br><br>"The airflow was very much like that produced by the One Thought Finger, so I went forward to ask."
<br><br>"The result was really the One Thought Finger, and according to him, he had practiced it in one night. The subordinate also does not believe, he made the gong in front of the subordinate, is indeed a thought finger cultivation after the completion of the gong." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The more Liu Yan listened, the bigger his eyes were.
<br><br>The more he felt that the subordinate description was true, and at the same time, the more he felt ripped.
<br><br>"Impossible." Liu Yan then said again, "Even though the One-Ye Finger is only a low-level immortal technique, but at least it is also an immortal realm technique. I have never heard of anyone who can cultivate the One Thought Finger in one ye."
<br><br>"But my subordinate did see him use the One Thought Finger with his own eyes!"
<br><br>"I know." Liu Yan raised his hand and waved it to stop his subordinate's words, "I'm not saying that I don't think he can't use the One Thought Finger, I'm just saying that it's impossible for the One Thought Finger to be cultivated in just one night."
<br><br>"No matter how good the talent is, it's not like that. Not to mention that he is only a mere human immortal. Furthermore, if the talent is so good, how can it be just a mere human immortal."
<br><br>"It's too outrageous. Maybe this thought finger was cultivated by him before."
<br><br>"This ...... One Thought Finger is only a low-level merit method, but it is also a secret method of this sect. The technique is only available in the Immortal Technique Pavilion." The subordinate listened to straight frown, "The peak master's meaning, could it ...... be that he suspects that the One Thought Finger Technique has been stolen?"
<br><br>Liu Yan pursed his lips not to speak.
<br><br>One thought finger is the secret method of the Sun and Moon Sect, even if it is only a low-level gong method, it will never be passed on.
<br><br>The Immortal Technique Pavilion has borrowing records and cultivation records for all the techniques.
<br><br>It is unlikely that there would be no news at all if it had really been stolen out.
<br><br>"I don't know."
<br><br>Liu Yan could not understand how.
<br><br>She said to her subordinate, "Go and bring the person here, I want to ask him personally."
<br><br>"Yes!" The subordinate answered and retreated.
<br><br>......
<br><br>At the same time, the Immortal Realm Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>A group of people gathered together, their faces were all gloomy.
<br><br>The Heavenly Immortal Hall was the central jurisdiction of the vast Immortal Realm, the center and core of the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Those who can come here are all the reigning powers of the Immortal Realm, overseeing all matters of the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Any one of them is an existence that can turn the hand into clouds and the hand into rain in the immortal world.
<br><br>At this moment, countless old men gathered in the articulated hall, exchanging words about various possibilities. All faces are sad.
<br><br>Being noisy in the middle of the hall, an old man with a head full of white hair walked out from behind the immortal world hall with a walking stick.
<br><br>The cacophony in the great hall quieted down.
<br><br>In the next moment, the people in the Great Hall poked over.
<br><br>"Elder Shi, what is going on with the recent celestial phenomenon?"
<br><br>Someone next to him also echoed, "Yes, the recent celestial phenomena have changed, meteors attacking the sky, and even a great astral blast!"
<br><br>"Could it be that something big is about to happen in the immortal world again?"
<br><br>The old man did not answer immediately, just pestled the cane rickety body walked to the main seat and sat down.
<br><br>Raising his head, his always kind face was now full of seriousness.
<br><br>The next moment, sighed at the incessantly inquiring crowd, helplessly and gravely shook his head, "This kind of astrology, I have never seen in so many epochs in the immortal world."
<br><br>"Last night, when I projected the astrolabe, there was no answer either."
<br><br>"How can that be? Old Timer, you personally calculate the astrolabe did not calculate?" Below is another burst of noise and anxiety.
<br><br>A group of people were like ants on a hot pot.
<br><br>There was a lot of discussion for a long time, but they didn't come up with an answer.
<br><br>After dispersing, each in the secret are making preparations and backhand.
<br><br>After all, these bizarre and terrifying heaven and earth phenomenon, no one knows what will happen in the future, and what is caused by the ......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Immortal World.
<br><br>Sun and Moon Sect.
<br><br>Star Peak.
<br><br>Star Hall.
<br><br>Liu Yan was silent in the hall, not knowing what he was thinking about.
<br><br>A sound outside the door, the sound of footsteps and approaching. She immediately raised her head and looked at the door with a puzzled and uncomfortable gaze.
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, Liu Yan's gaze calmed down and raised an eyebrow.
<br><br>"Peak Master Guo is very idle, free to come up to me, I wonder what's the matter?"
