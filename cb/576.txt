Yi Feng almost burst out laughing.
<br><br>It seems that after all he has done, it was not in vain!
<br><br>But he also understood.
<br><br>Now is not the final moment, the next is the most important thing.
<br><br>So he didn't act too out of shape, simply nodded in satisfaction, "Not bad, very good!"
<br><br>But this simple nod from Yi Feng gave Gong Chen a great encouragement.
<br><br>More than that, he was secretly glad that he had not speculated wrongly about Yi Feng's meaning just now.
<br><br>"En ...... how about making a deal?"
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched his voice and asked.
<br><br>"Senior please explain."
<br><br>Gong Chen said respectfully. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"En, you also know that it's quite difficult to live on this island, right?" Yi Feng said meaningfully, "You also see, if you follow me, it's not so difficult right?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Gong Chen, who was waiting with his head down, suddenly stared.
<br><br>"Senior, what do you mean?"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yi Feng opened the door and said, "I want you to be my follower, and I will guarantee that you will be clothed and fed on this island."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng looked at Gong Chen nervously.
<br><br>In his heart, he was secretly speculating whether this Gong Chen of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm would become his follower for a mouthful of food?
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that before he had time to think deeply, Gong Chen knelt down to the ground with a poof.
<br><br>"Senior I am willing."
<br><br>The voice was filled with urgency and excitement.
<br><br>And hot and flattered.
<br><br>This kind of appearance, directly Yi Feng whole confused.
<br><br>Immortal cultivator.
<br><br>It does not look so forced well ......
<br><br>In order to a bucket of rice, or will break the waist of well.
<br><br>Although Gong Chen promised to be fast to let him unexpected, but for Yi Feng, is always a good thing.
<br><br>Reincarnation Immortal Realm ah.
<br><br>This is a big man ah.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The reason why Yi Feng wanted to take this expert, or to pave the way for himself when he gets out.
<br><br>Just think about it.
<br><br>He used the convenience of Shadow Island to enlist a group of experts to follow him, so in the future, after leaving this damn place, wouldn't he have a large group of experts to cover him outside?
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Yi Feng was also afraid that this guy would turn against him after he went out in the future, so he directly made this guy take an oath on the spot.
<br><br>He knew that this thing is still useful for immortal cultivators.
<br><br>So, it is also considered foolproof.
<br><br>The next few days.
<br><br>There was an additional Gong Chen in Yi Feng's courtyard.
<br><br>Let Yi Feng is very satisfied, this Gong Chen thief damn eyesight, the usual daily cleaning, watering the plants he automatically dry up.
<br><br>It is simply a complaint.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, a few days passed.
<br><br>"Quack quack quack!"
<br><br>"Brrrrrr!"
<br><br>"Are you going to change your name or not?"
<br><br>"No!"
<br><br>"You old thing."
<br><br>Frog Ben Wei jumped into the black sea in anger and swam into the deep sea.
<br><br>Slowly gave him a white look and closed his eyes.
<br><br>On the side, Gong Chen, who was listening to the conversation between the two masters, did not dare to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>After staying here for so many days, where he still does not know the two masters of bullying?
<br><br>Simply shocked off his big teeth.
<br><br>See frog Ben Wei jumped into the black sea after, he only took the towel, trembling and approached slowly.
<br><br>"Slowly master, the little one to wipe your body."
<br><br>Slowly opened his eyelids, and then closed his eyes.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Only then did Gong Chen carefully start wiping.
<br><br>But not long after, slowly opened his eyes again.
<br><br>"Ask you a question."
<br><br>"Slow master commanded."
<br><br>"Slow Ben Wei, good to hear?"
<br><br>"Enlighten the slow master, it's simply bullish, in line with the temperament of the slow master." Gong Chen respectfully replied.
<br><br>Slowly eyes flashed.
<br><br>Closed his eyes in satisfaction.
<br><br>A certain immortal continent.
<br><br>A lion-like coiled under the city tower.
<br><br>Four black robes aggrieved bar sitting on the ground, and a ghost floating next to it.
<br><br>The black robes were covered with dust, showing all the wretchedness.
<br><br>The back, as depressed as possible.
<br><br>"Grass ah!"
<br><br>"This big man just can't understand, why is this?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei slapped his thighs, stood up, full of reluctance shouted: "You say we brothers easily get countless gold coins, thought to be able to live in this immortal world fast and dazzling, but the damn run over, this damn place does not use gold coins, with immortal crystals?"
<br><br>"Brother, you quickly do not say, immortal red House that girl, just now also blocked me to ask for the last immortal crystal it!"
<br><br>The dog rubbed his temples, full of sorrow.
<br><br>"Brother, I'm hungry, it's been a long time since I tasted something fresh." A side of the milk agent raised his head, full of aggression, looking at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Eat eat eat, you just know eat, big brother's sister are not done yet, where to eat?" Night wind rolled up a burst of white eyes, straight glare milk agent.
<br><br>Milk agent aggrieved lowered his head, plucked up grass on the ground, one by one into the mouth.
<br><br>"I was able to follow big brother to satiate my eyes, but now it's all a luxury."
<br><br>"Oooh, how miserable ......"
<br><br>Spirit King floated in mid-air, tilting his head and sighing.
