The atmosphere of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan was frozen to the extreme, fearing that Milk Leopard Li would directly get angry and lash out.
<br><br>And Ao Qingcheng is tightly biting her red lips, looking at Ao Qing's back, finally came forward.
<br><br>"I ...... no matter what, I beg you not to let her take away my child, okay?" Ao Qingcheng said with tears in her eyes, her jade fist clenched tightly.
<br><br>She didn't know how to face Ao Qing, but in front of the child, she finally took the initiative to speak, and her words were even more tinged with a hint of supplication.
<br><br>Even she does not know whether Ao Qing can really save the day, but she can trust and rely on Ao Qing, and only Ao Qing.
<br><br>After all, she is the mother of the child.
<br><br>She was also able to realize that once she really let Milk Leopard Li take the little wolf away, I'm afraid that they would never see each other again in this life.
<br><br>Ao Qing also gave Ao Qingcheng a complicated look.
<br><br>The day in the martial arts school he was able to take possession of Ao Qingcheng's body as he wished, but staying in the martial arts school, his state of mind has long been less than before.
<br><br>For this once vicious, and cold woman, he has long been no love, and even a few disdain.
<br><br>But at this moment looking at her eyes with tears, Ao Qing's heart suddenly had a few touching, a few soft heart. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Don't worry!"
<br><br>He nodded solemnly.
<br><br>With that, throw a firm look towards Ao Qingcheng.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng tightly bit her red lips, bowed her head and stood next to Ao Qing, only praying in her heart that Ao Qing really had a way to keep the child.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Milk Pao Li looked at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>She never thought that under the envelope of her demon emperor aura, there was still someone talking to her like this.
<br><br>It couldn't be helped.
<br><br>She looked her gaze up and down at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>It was impossible to see the cultivation level and did not seem to be the slightest bit threatening.
<br><br>"So, you are the father of the seven little wolves?" She asked towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Of course this scum is not." Bone Ben Wei crossed his arms and said.
<br><br>"You are not?" Milk Leopard Ree asked.
<br><br>"Yes, that's my big brother, I'm the one." Ao Qing stepped out and said in a deep voice, turning his icy gaze towards Milk Leopard Li.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>"Fine, then I'll re-notice once more in front of you, these seven little wolves, no matter if you agree or not today, I, Milk Leopard Li, will take them away on behalf of the Western Demon Forest, do you hear me!"
<br><br>Her tone, full of impatience.
<br><br>With her status, representing the Western Demon Forest, she had come to this remote place to take away the seven little wolves, and she had encountered so much trouble, so her patience had almost worn out for her.
<br><br>So she did not carelessly use her gaze until she finished, and slightly measured the child's father, Ao Qing, a glance.
<br><br>But this glance.
<br><br>But directly let her heart a thud.
<br><br>She fiercely remembered ......
<br><br>When she came to the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Tribe, the shocking scene she encountered on the road ......
<br><br>and a scene that she would never forget!
<br><br>That day.
<br><br>A white-robed man broke the sky with one fist in front of her, directly breaking the blocked Immortal Path and allowing the Irrigation of Immortality to flood back into the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>And she clearly remembered that the white-robed man was followed by a dog-shaped demonic beast.
<br><br>And that dog-shaped demonic beast, but is not the Ao Qing in front of you?
<br><br>In accordance with the previous Ao Zhong said that the little wolf's biological father, followed by the side of a supreme master, so all this does not match up?
<br><br>That is to say, the supreme master, is the existence of the one fist breaking the sky ......
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>She took a step back in a fierce panic, and her body was covered in cold sweat.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Both legs could not help but a soft, knees involuntarily fell to the ground.
<br><br>Her scalp tingled as she raised her head, her high posture suddenly changed, and said with a compensating smile towards Ao Qing, "That, just now I was joking, do you believe me?"
<br><br>This sudden scene caused an uproar among the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"This, how could he?"
<br><br>"How could this demon emperor suddenly kneel down with that stance?"
<br><br>The crowd in the room was dumbfounded.
<br><br>No one had expected that Milk Leopard Li, who was unbeatable just now, had suddenly turned into such a posture.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>was still a demon emperor?
<br><br>And especially Ao Qingcheng, she opened her red lips and turned her shocked gaze to Ao Qing next to her.
<br><br>She looked soft at the moment, but she was still one of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan's Heavenly Daughter, and she was keenly aware just now that Milk Leopard Li had undergone this change precisely after she had glanced at Ao Qing.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>Just one look.
<br><br>It made a demon emperor go from a high posture, to a humble appearance.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What kind of energy does it take, anyway?
<br><br>That is to say, this former fop trash in front of him, in just one year's time, not only destroyed the Red Sun lineage's plot with his own power in the first place, but now he even made the Demon Emperor kneel down in direct fear.
<br><br>Ao Qing.
<br><br>In the end, what has been experienced?
<br><br>And in the end what kind of changes have occurred?
<br><br>At this moment, she had to admit, once this let her despise the waste, in a year's time, has become a let her look up to the existence.
<br><br>"Very good, you still recognize me."
<br><br>Ao Qing was half-surprised by Milk Leopard Li's gesture and emitted a languid voice.
<br><br>"That day one side, never forget, naturally remember, remember." Milk Leopard Li's forehead left sweat, warily responded.
<br><br>"Then my son?"
<br><br>Ao Qing's voice sank, wanting to say something.
<br><br>"Of course of course, my west demon forest what virtue and how can I be able to cultivate seniors' son, of course it is more suitable for seniors to personally cultivate, my previous offensive behavior, also please seniors rest in anger ......"
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li voice trembling said.
<br><br>Such a scene directly caused the entire Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan to be in an uproar to the extreme.
<br><br>"Senior?"
<br><br>"This Milk Leopard Li actually addressed the Third Prince as senior?"
<br><br>"She's a demon emperor!"
<br><br>"Ow, did I hear that right?"
<br><br>"Then what is the Third Prince's cultivation level?"
<br><br>The crowd was shocked for a time.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng, who was on the side, was also still in shock for a long time, because the scene in front of her was confirming her guess.
<br><br>Ao Qing, had really reached a point where she was looking up to him.
<br><br>This made her heart indescribably complicated.
<br><br>She was also a proud person, even after the previous defeat, but she was also upset and did not identify with Ao Qing at the bottom of her heart, not to mention that Ao Qing was much better than him.
<br><br>Even with a child, in times of crisis she will think of Ao Qing to protect, but it does not see her heart really identify with Ao Qing.
<br><br>But at this moment ......
<br><br>She couldn't help but glance at Ao Qing, couldn't help but lower her head.
<br><br>PS: The recent update is slow, my fault, really poor physical condition, in recuperation, sorry sorry, must slowly recover.
