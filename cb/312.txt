"By the way, you still haven't told me that there are really demonic beasts inside this mountain?" Yi Feng asked, "It's the kind of demonic beast that eats people?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>The woman in white nodded her head.
<br><br>"It seems I was really rash, ah, if I had known it was so dangerous, I should not have gone up the mountain!" Yi Feng said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>The white-clothed woman shook her head, feeling that this mortal only now knows the danger of this hundred thousand big mountain.
<br><br>More peculiar is that really crossed here unharmed.
<br><br>I don't know if it's a silly man with a silly fortune.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>At this moment, the woman in white suddenly ate a painful pout, and then on her white calf, a tiny wound appeared.
<br><br>And when Yi Feng saw this, the longsword in his hand also moved in a hurry.
<br><br>Clang! First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>A half-meter long snake with a piece of diamond-shaped pattern on its body was cut into two halves by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Damn, it's a chessboard snake!"
<br><br>Picking the head of the long snake with his long sword, his brow furrowed.
<br><br>Hearing this, the woman in white's face also suddenly changed.
<br><br>Apparently this kind of snake she had also heard of.
<br><br>Although not considered a demonic beast, but the toxicity is extremely strong, if her cultivation is still in place is not much of a problem, but now ......
<br><br>She had a face of death.
<br><br>It's really a case of the house leaking into the night.
<br><br>But just when she was full of resignation, a tear, Yi Feng pulled off a piece of cloth from his clothes and tied it tightly to her calf.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>She asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Don't move and don't talk, or you will only speed up the spread of the poison."
<br><br>Yi Feng hastily scolded.
<br><br>Saying that, he used his long sword to carefully make a slit at her wound, and then put his mouth over it.
<br><br>"Don't ......"
<br><br>She instantly understood that Yi Feng was trying to suck the snake poison for her, which made her subconsciously shrink her long legs back.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng grabbed her calf with one hand and drank with a stern face, "I told you not to move, give me honestly stay."
<br><br>The woman in white was stunned by this drink.
<br><br>Good.
<br><br>So domineering!
<br><br>Also at the same time, Yi Feng held her calf and was sucking the snake poison one bite at a time.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's buried and serious appearance, the woman in white's pretty face showed a moved look and shouted anxiously, "You'll die if you get it like this."
<br><br>However, Yi Feng, as if he had not heard, helped her suck the snake poison one by one.
<br><br>Only when Yi Feng felt it was almost done did he stop moving.
<br><br>"How are you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Much better, I can feel that there is not much toxin left, this toxin even if I do not have the cultivation, but my physique can also eliminate it." The woman in white said, and after she finished, she added, "Thank you."
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief, pulled off another piece of cloth and helped the white-clothed woman carefully wrap the wound.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's appearance as he carefully wrapped her wound, the woman in white had an indescribably complicated face.
<br><br>She never thought that she had been saved once again by this mortal.
<br><br>"Okay, I'll go find some more herbs for you to put on."
<br><br>Yi Feng tied the cloth on a knot, just to get up, but the legs are a weak, full of black eyes at the same time, the brain suddenly dizzy, and fell over.
<br><br>"How are you?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the woman in white's face changed dramatically, she hurriedly struggled to Yi Feng's front and picked him up with all her strength.
<br><br>"How are you, say something?"
<br><br>"Don't you scare me."
<br><br>"I told you not to suck, sucked will be dead you still do not listen."
<br><br>Will Yi Feng hands and feet in the arms, hands and feet do not know how to do.
<br><br>In the past.
<br><br>A human life, she simply do not put on the heart.
<br><br>But once I remembered, this mortal died of poisoning to save her ......
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>She is really panicked, pupils have been covered with blood.
<br><br>Yi Feng never thought that just squatting for too long, suddenly stand up resulting in brain congestion, become dizzy eyes black and briefly fainted.
<br><br>Good, now has slowed down.
<br><br>But it felt a softness around the body, and a faint fragrance came.
<br><br>He opened his eyes.
<br><br>Into the eyes.
<br><br>A piece of snow white.
<br><br>At the same time, there is a hand clinging to him, covering the feeling that he felt a burst of suffocation.
<br><br>"Oooh ...... loose, loose, loose, I can't breathe."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted in a hurry.
<br><br>"You're okay, it's great that you're okay." The woman in white cried out with a face full of excitement, and her palm was also released from Yi Feng.
<br><br>"I'm fine fine, let me get up first to slow down."
<br><br>Yi Feng even gasped two breaths, climbed up meaningfully looked at the woman in white, also never thought that this woman in clothes looks nothing, but actually so domineering.
<br><br>But remembering what just happened, Yi Feng is also a little embarrassed, so busy said: "You wait here first, I'll go to help you find some herbs!"
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng hurriedly ran out of the cave.
<br><br>"Damn, just know that there are demon beasts inside this mountain, but don't let me encounter demon beasts!"
<br><br>With a sword in one hand, Yi Feng went inside the forest and helped the woman look for herbs.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"Another human?"
<br><br>Just then, a black-clothed man in the sky stood in the air and spotted Yi Feng's trail.
<br><br>And he had a pair of bull horns on his head, and his nose was much bigger than normal.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This person was not a human.
<br><br>"I didn't expect that there are still human beings inside this mountain, since I saw it, let's settle it all together!"
<br><br>He said secretly and quickly turned into a stream of light and approached towards Yi Feng.
