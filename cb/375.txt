"Lord Chau."
<br><br>"What's wrong with you?"
<br><br>"You are?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Xiang and the others couldn't help but be startled and hurriedly turned their surprised gazes towards Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>What in the world is going on here.
<br><br>The titled Lord of the Qingyu Immortal Continent was actually sitting on his butt on the ground.
<br><br>Moreover, looking at his expression, he seemed to be very grave?
<br><br>However, at this moment, Su Xuanjun completely ignored Yunxiang and the others next to him, his mind reverberated with Yunxiang's words just now.
<br><br>This news, falling on his ears, was like an explosive thunderstorm, causing him to break out in a cold sweat.
<br><br>It also made him recall the words that appeared in his mind when he left just now.
<br><br>"I will definitely come to you." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>When you think about it, this seems to be the same white robed youth Yi Feng said ah.
<br><br>So, where is this illusionary hearing, and where is this coincidence, it is clearly said to him.
<br><br>The thought of this, Su Xuanjun feel body weak, the back was wet with cold sweat, staring eyes filled with fear.
<br><br>Let's not say that Yi Feng in the end what strength, just that support the boat and bald head, are enough to make him powerless.
<br><br>"Lord of the continent, Lord of the continent, what is wrong with you?"
<br><br>Seeing that Su Xuanjun had been silent, Yun Xiang and the others could not help but pass out their voices again.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun, who reacted, scolded, while immediately ordering, "Inform this down, send people to keep an eye on the entrance from the Immortal River Continent to my Qingyu Immortal Continent."
<br><br>"Yes, Continent Lord, I will be in charge of this."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Xiang immediately volunteered, while patting his bladder and said, "Please rest assured, continent lord, I will guard the entrance, I will definitely not let any person from the Immortal River Continent come in, I will kill one if one comes, I will kill a pair if one comes."
<br><br>After saying that, Yun Xiang's face was filled with a smile.
<br><br>Now that Black Feather has rebelled and all the other Golden Immortals of the demon race have been captured, it is also becoming a windfall for him, Cloud Elephant, to rise to the top.
<br><br>So if he didn't show solicitude at this moment, when would he wait?
<br><br>But he thought Su Xuanjun would praise him, never thought, he just finished, Su Xuanjun slap to his face.
<br><br>"I'll kill your mother."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun gritted his teeth and sent out a voice, drinking in a deep voice: "I only need you to guard the entrance, if anyone comes over to tell me, when did I ask you to kill someone?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun hated to slap the cloud elephant to death.
<br><br>If that person really came, who shot who first not to mention, in case a complete anger of that person, I am afraid there is really no room for maneuvering.
<br><br>At least for the time being, although that person is on his own, but why exactly he is on his own is not known.
<br><br>Perhaps there is a misunderstanding, there may be other hidden agenda.
<br><br>But no matter what, there is not yet room to tear the face off.
<br><br>So if he does come over, just wait and see for now, and don't make a move if you can.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Yun Xiang covered his face and nodded his head, but after hesitating for a while, he still couldn't help but say, "But Lord of the Continent, why are you doing this, do you not want the immortal weapons you lost, and the group of subordinates, are they not going to be saved?"
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>This one sentence finally enraged Su Xuanjun completely.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Accompanied by a miserable cry from the cloud elephant, he directly slapped the cloud elephant into a meat cake.
<br><br>A half-witted fellow, which pot is not open to mention which pot.
<br><br>He is not angry?
<br><br>He is angry ah!
<br><br>Especially the demented knife, throwing is to make his heart and liver pain, ass, eye pain.
<br><br>But what can be done?
<br><br>That place is enough to go once.
<br><br>On the contrary, that person does not come to him, he thanked God!
