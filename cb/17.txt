 But although there were doubts in his heart, he did not dare to say more.
<br><br>"Master Yi, this is my ......" Old Ancestor Qingshan turned slightly sideways and prepared to introduce Zhu Yun towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and interrupted, "I see, uncle and nephew, right?"
<br><br>"Worthy of being a senior."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan was full of admiration.
<br><br>But thought backwards he was redundant, with this senior's uncanny means, I'm afraid he could see Zhu Yun's identity with just one glance.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>This is nothing at all.
<br><br>Qing Shan an old man, Zhu Yun a middle-aged man, the two are close, Zhu Yun and so respectful to Qing Shan, think it should be just uncle and nephew this kind of kinship.
<br><br>"But you guys came just in time, I'm out of wine here, do you have any wine?" Yi Feng is not polite, directly ask for wine, Peng Ying that woman to Yi Feng not sad is impossible, the only little stock left at home has also drunk up.
<br><br>"There is there is." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan said in a hurry, but after promising but remembered that he came too quickly, simply forgot to bring wine, good thing Zhu Yun is on the side, he will look at Zhu Yun.
<br><br>"Uncle, you ......"
<br><br>Zhu Yun's heart appeared a bad premonition.
<br><br>"Your victory fruit tantalizing, take it out!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan said with an open hand.
<br><br>"Ah?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun's face dark, full of reluctance, he this Sheng Guo Tan only three bottles a year, to him is priceless, usually no one would give to drink, but now he wants to take out to a mortal?
<br><br>"Hurry up."
<br><br>Seeing that Zhu Yun was so insensitive, the old ancestor of Qingshan was anxious, his arm stretched out to knock a violent chestnut on Zhu Yun's head.
<br><br>"Senior uncle you at least give me some face." Zhu Yun held his head, full of aggression muttered: "I am at least the sect master of the Castle Peak Sect, if this is seen, where is my majesty ah!"
<br><br>"What's wrong with a small sect master, and you're panting?" The old ancestor of Castle Peak scolded: "I warn you, here, even if you are a dragon also give me obediently coiled."
<br><br>Saying that, another chestnut towards Zhu Yun knocked.
<br><br>Zhu Yun hurriedly retreated and looked at the old ancestor of Castle Peak with a face full of aggression.
<br><br>"Do not bring out the wine?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan drank.
<br><br>Only under Old Ancestor Castle Peak's compulsion did Zhu Yun bring out the Shengguo Tan with a reluctant face.
<br><br>"Look at your petty, girly look, it's your honor to let you take out this wine today." The old ancestor of Qing Shan scolded and snatched the Sheng Guo Tan, then changed his face and said with a smile, "Master Yi, the wine is average, and I don't know if it is to your taste, so please settle for it."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, he has always been not polite people, at once a small sip, said straight: "The wine is good, but also almost taste."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan kept pecking at the rice.
<br><br>But Zhu Yun on the side almost stormed out.
<br><br>This mortal's mouth is a little too big, right?
<br><br>He knew that his Shengguo Tantra was a priceless item, and he only had three bottles a year as the head of the Castle Peak Sect, but this damn mortal actually said that his Shengguo Tantra was a little less tasty?
<br><br>He really couldn't figure out why the Green Mountain Ancestor would be so polite to this mortal.
<br><br>If it were not for the fact that the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak was here he would not dare to act rashly, with his status, he would have slapped this mortal into a meat cake.
<br><br>But the old ancestor was here, so he could only suppress his anger in his heart.
<br><br>"Disciple, bring two more stools." Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>Zhong Qing quickly moved out two stools.
<br><br>"Oh, watching the sunset in the sky, the beauty of the dusk, and having a small drink, it is not a bad life!" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan sat down on the small stool next to Yi Feng and sighed with emotion, this dusk seemed beautiful to him, but ashamed that he could not comprehend this mood of his predecessor ah!
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Zhu Yun but a light hum in his heart.
<br><br>This mortal if not for the sake of the Castle Peak Ancestor, would have died a million times, the hall of the Castle Peak Ancestor and his Castle Peak Sect Master to visit, this mortal will not invite them into the house hospitality is just, but actually make two broken stools to sit at the door?
<br><br>Who are you looking down on?
<br><br>But because the old ancestor of Castle Peak can not be angry, he just stand there half a word.
<br><br>A glimpse.
<br><br>Saw a side of Yi Feng stall martial arts books, he subconsciously reached out to turn over.
