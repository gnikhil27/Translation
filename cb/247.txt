<br><br>"You seek death!"
<br><br>The giant auger mouth spit out a chill, deadly stare at this black-robed man.
<br><br>"Yo, the little reptile still has a big temper!" Bone Ben Wei crossed his arms and said disdainfully.
<br><br>"You ...... I'm not a reptile, I'm a proud augur!" The giant augur was angry with the black robe and growled.
<br><br>"No, you are a reptile!" Bone Ben Wei continued to provoke.
<br><br>"You ...... you you ...... you go to hell."
<br><br>The giant augur was furious at this moment, and the ice arrow that had just condensed out of his mouth turned around and instantly locked Lou Benwei in the direction.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>The sound of breaking air rose, and the ice arrow fell straight down.
<br><br>It was so powerful that it tore the sky out of the spatial cracks and reached the top of Bone Ben Wei's head in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>"Boom!"

<br><br>"Go, go, do what you need to do!" Bone Ben Wei waved his hand, then looked his gaze towards the giant auger.
<br><br>"Little reptile, tonight this scum is in a bad mood, so I'm going to use one billionth of my power to play with you, I hope you can let me play enough ah!"

<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>The pain was so great that the giant augur let out a heart-breaking cry.
<br><br>"Call your sister, call your sister, call your sister."

<br><br>She never imagined that this rascal was actually strong to this extent!
<br><br>"These people of theirs, what kind of people are they?"
<br><br>Li Yihan dumbfounded looking at Skeleton Ben Wei's divine might, her heart could not help but think like this, full of doubts.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>This doubt is not only him, but also the majority of people present.
<br><br>Since Bone Ben Wei had unilaterally beaten that giant jiao, the panicked appearance of the crowd suddenly relaxed, completely turning into a crowd of spectators.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Why is there someone sleeping on that ground?"
