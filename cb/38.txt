"You're welcome, girl."
<br><br>Yi Feng also got up and nodded slightly.
<br><br>And compliments of the golden phrase frequently, he also gladly accept it ......
<br><br>Five thousand years of cultural heritage, this is just the tip of the iceberg but, although these sentences are not from him, but also considered his welfare as a travellers!
<br><br>"It's very comfortable to be in contact with the Duke." Bai Piaoqiao praised.
<br><br>Yi Feng just smiled, and chatting, Bai Piao Piao also unknowingly tore her chicken leg to finish, Yi Feng and to her to tear off a few pieces of fish, as a return compliment.
<br><br>On the side, Mao Mao eat mouth full of oil, but listen to the conversation between the two listened to a baffled.
<br><br>This is the first time she has seen her own lady praise a person so much.
<br><br>"Listen to the poem you just read, you must not be a local!" Bai Piaoqiao asked again.
<br><br>"Yes, and not yet."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng could not help but sigh, looking at the bright moon, and remembered his hometown, and could not help but take a long drink. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Sure enough."
<br><br>"Gongzi is a man with a story."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao looked at Yi Feng's slightly downcast side, his heart could not help but rise interest in a mortal, and asked softly, "Gongzi's story, would you like to tell Piaoqiao to hear it?"
<br><br>"No." Yi Feng directly refused.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Bai Piaodiao huffed, she had never been rejected before, but did not expect Yi Feng to reject so cleanly, this feeling of being rejected is really not pleasant ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng just looked at her apologetically, and did not explain anything.
<br><br>His story, traced too far and too far away.
<br><br>It was another world, another civilization ......
<br><br>Besides, this is also the biggest secret in his heart besides that chicken-ribbed system.
<br><br>"It's Peopeo's surprise, then the gentleman will sit first, so I won't disturb you." Bai Peopeo lightly said, then led Mao Mao to get up and leave.
<br><br>But just as she got up, she stopped walking again.
<br><br>Turning back, she asked, "By the way, does your son read books?"
<br><br>"Books?"
<br><br>"Don't read."
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head apologetically.
<br><br>"Oh, okay!"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao nodded, and for the first time, the eyes of Yi Feng appeared bleak and disappointed.
<br><br>Although Yi Feng was a mortal, she had rarely run into such a person, and she was not even opposed to being a good confidant with him.
<br><br>I thought that Yi Feng would also have read the two books.
<br><br>Unfortunately ......
<br><br>Eat and drink enough, wine after three rounds, Yi Feng leaned on the railing and froze for a long, long time.
<br><br>It was midnight.
<br><br>Yi Feng just returned to the room, turning out the bamboo basket with the special book Dream of the Red Chamber pillowed under the hard bed board, gradually deep sleep.
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>Yi Feng got up early, found Bai Piao Piao and Mao Mao, and was also ready to say goodbye.
<br><br>"If you don't have a place to stay next time you go into the mountains, you can still come here." When saying goodbye, Bai Piao Piao deliberated again and again and said these words.
<br><br>"Thank you, Miss Piao Piao."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded towards the two women, turned away with the bamboo basket on his back and set off on the way down the mountain.
<br><br>"Miss, why do you still want him to come?" On the side, Mao Mao asked in confusion.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao smiled.
<br><br>Yi Feng was just a mortal, he could not affect or threaten their plans.
<br><br>Moreover, his connotation and insight made Bai Piao Piao admire from the bottom of her heart. Although the admiration for a mortal seems quite heavenly, but the fact seems to be so.
<br><br>Therefore, she did not reject the arrival of this mortal.
<br><br>It's just a pity that he doesn't read books.
<br><br>If not, there would be more common ground to talk about!
<br><br>"Okay, but it's good that he's coming, that fish was really good last night." Mao Mao smiled mischievously, salivating over that delicious food again.
<br><br>"Well, you hurry up and clean up the room where he lived!" Bai Piao Piao said in a good-natured manner.
<br><br>Mao Mao stuck out his tongue and obediently went to clean up the room.
<br><br>But in a short while, he ran back, while his mouth shouted: "Miss, Miss, come and see!"
