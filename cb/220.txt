"Master, it's not like we brought the Heavenly Toad Silk with us, so it's really not good to make a rash visit like this."
<br><br>At the door, Shu Qinhua said with a worried face, "In case we cause this senior's displeasure, it would be serious."
<br><br>"You child, it's not like we came to the door to cause trouble, so how could we be offended?" Xue Qinzhu said with quite a lecture, "Besides back, if my master doesn't pay a visit first, how will he decide whether to give him the Heavenly Toad Silk or not?"
<br><br>"Alas, Master, you should have trusted me and brought the Heavenly Toad Silk directly."
<br><br>Book Qinhua shook her head and said with an ugly face.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu remained unconcerned.
<br><br>Even though she could tell by looking at the martial intent on the plaque above her head that the owner of this place was indeed an expert.
<br><br>But it is not just because the opposite side is an expert, it does not directly take out the family's mountain treasure.
<br><br>Moreover, although the other side is strong, but she as the Devil's Voice Sect leader, a long way to visit personally, is enough to reflect her sincerity.
<br><br>So even if they are experts, they have to sell her some face!
<br><br>"Come on, let's go in!" Xue Qinzhu said. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Book qin painting shook his head, really do not know what to do, only to stifle the head to go forward.
<br><br>"Book qin painting, visit sir, please ask if sir is in?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was just finishing up his work in the backyard, heard the voice harm not being able to wash his hands and went towards the door.
<br><br>Finally, Yi Feng walked to the door.
<br><br>Then he saw the gentle and graceful Shu Qin painting, and a beautiful woman with an extraordinary temperament.
<br><br>The same time.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu was also the first to turn her gaze, to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Looked at this, her disciple's mouth "handwriting through the sky" of the supreme master!
<br><br>But.
<br><br>She was a little disappointed.
<br><br>Because this person, apart from his extraordinary temperament, gentle and elegant, did not seem to have too many outstanding features, and was even too young to look like.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Shu Qinhua greeted respectfully, while she hurriedly winked at Xue Qinzhu.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>In the way of Shu Qinhua, Xue Qinzhu also clasped her fist in greeting, but not as respectful as she thought.
<br><br>With a slightly embarrassed face, Shu Qinhua hurriedly introduced, "Sir, this is my aunt, she came with me to visit you this time."
<br><br>Obviously at this moment, she had not forgotten the admonition that Lu Qingshan had given at the door.
<br><br>Everything, with the posture of a mortal.
<br><br>"Good day to you."
<br><br>"It's cold outside, come in and sit down."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, then turned back towards the martial school with his hands behind his back.
<br><br>"You, Master, how can you be so disrespectful in front of this gentleman?" Shu Qinhua said with a slight reproach.
<br><br>"Disciple, are you sure you're not mistaken about the person?"
<br><br>But Xue Qinzhu asked rhetorically, "This one really doesn't look like any expert, if not for the fact that the plaque of this martial school is indeed somewhat extraordinary, I'm afraid I would have turned away."
<br><br>"Master, you can't see the depth of this gentleman because his cultivation is really too high!" Shu Qinhua hastily explained.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu shook her head.
<br><br>Obviously, she didn't agree with what Book Qin Painting said.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back, she followed and raised her footsteps.
<br><br>That's fine.
<br><br>Just go in and see the depth of this person.
<br><br>"Master, make sure to adjust your mind and suppress your cultivation by entering the door, otherwise ......" Shu Qinhua followed, while hastily reminding.
<br><br>"You don't have to say much, I have my own numbers in my heart."
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu waved his hand to interrupt the words of Shu Qinpao, lifting his steps without thinking and stepped into the martial arts hall.
<br><br>But the moment she walked in, her face instantly changed as she was just strolling idly.
<br><br>On both sides of the wall, eighteen pictures of divine weapons emitted a huge pressure, invading towards her, immediately suppressing her unable to move.
<br><br>At the same time, her chest tightened.
<br><br>A mouthful of sweetness came up and was forcibly swallowed by her, and her feet retreated in lightning speed.
<br><br>At this moment, her face completely changed into a different look, and she hurriedly looked at Shu Qinhua and asked, "Disciple, what is going on here?"
<br><br>"Master, I told you, you must adjust your mind and suppress your cultivation when entering the door." Book Qin Painting explained with an ugly face, "Because the last time I came I felt the benefits, why don't you listen, how is it, how are your injuries?"
<br><br>"I'm fine."
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu said distractedly, because more than the injury, she realized a more serious problem.
<br><br>That is, this youth in front of her, I'm afraid is really as terrifying as her disciple said!
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>It was likely that she had sat back and watched the sky.
<br><br>"Disciple, quickly follow me in."
<br><br>Compared to just now, Xue Qinzhu had completely changed her appearance and hurriedly walked towards the martial school.
<br><br>But this time.
<br><br>She pressed her cultivation to death, and her mind was adjusted to the most peaceful state.
<br><br>Sure enough, when she went in again, she did not have the pressure she had just felt.
<br><br>But even so, she still didn't dare to look at the eighteen paintings more.
<br><br>However, she did not look at the eighteen paintings, but saw the demon mirror hanging in the front hall.
<br><br>Although she is not a demon, but under this mirror also feel numb, as if all the body's secrets are revealed.
<br><br>She drew a cold breath.
<br><br>But just through the front hall, her heart has not calmed down, but again and again suffered a shock.
<br><br>The umbrella hanging aside ......
<br><br>The rag on the table ......
<br><br>The sickle in the corner ......
<br><br>The stone table under the acacia tree ......
<br><br>As well as other items of all sizes ...... ranging from imperial to imperial products, all of them were shocking to her eyes.
<br><br>"Please sit down."
<br><br>At this moment Yi Feng just had time to wash a hand, while greeting the two, from the side of a Xuan paper to wipe their hands.
<br><br>Seeing the landscape painting on this rice paper, Xue Qinzhu straight felt suffocated.
<br><br>Especially such a valuable landscape painting was destroyed by Yi Feng after wiping his hands, not even blinked and thrown in the trash barrel look, straight let Xue Qinzhu heart flooded with huge waves.
<br><br>Only at this moment did she understand that what Shu Qinhua said to her was not half exaggerated.
<br><br>And she also deeply understood the true meaning of the word "handwriting through the sky".
<br><br>Looking at Xue Qinzhu's appearance, Shu Qinhua's face was complicated.
<br><br>In fact, before she came in, she had expected that Xue Qinzhu would look like this after she came in.
<br><br>Because in such a situation, no one can still keep calm.
<br><br>The Xue Qinzhu who reacted also suddenly regretted that she did not listen to the words of Shu Qinhua, and even more regretted that she did not bring the Heavenly Toad Silk.
<br><br>So she wanted to remedy the situation.
<br><br>She looked at Shu Qinhua and hurriedly said, "Disciple, quickly tell this senior that we came in a hurry and didn't bring the Heavenly Toad Silk, but I will ask the sect elders to send it over as fast as possible, and if he has other needs, as long as my Magic Sound Sect has them, they can be sent over together."
<br><br>Book Qinhua nodded, steadied her heart, turned her nervous gaze to Yi Feng, and opened her red lips slightly.
<br><br>"Sir, originally this time I came to bring the Heavenly Toad Silk to you, but I'm sorry there was an accident and I didn't bring it, but don't worry, I will send the Heavenly Toad Silk as fast as I can, sir, you see ......"
<br><br>After saying that, Shu Qinhua and Xue Qinzhu turned their apprehensive eyes to Yi Feng.
