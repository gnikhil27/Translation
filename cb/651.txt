Said.
<br><br>Li Hongtian kicked the palm of his foot again.
<br><br>"Let your sister speak blindly, let your sister speak blindly."
<br><br>"Who the hell are you?"
<br><br>"Do I know you?"
<br><br>"Do I know you?"
<br><br>In just a few moments, Fang Scarf was trampled into a pig's head by Li Hongtian, and tears and snot fell out of his eyes.
<br><br>And the group of elders next to him, there with their hands in the air, didn't know what to do at all.
<br><br>You say on it.
<br><br>This is the West Ning Immortal Continent's continental lord in front of you.
<br><br>You say no, right, the own patriarch is about to be trampled to death. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>One of the elders had the courage to take the lead and shouted, "Continent Lord, what the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>"Is it a case of mistaken identity!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we are from the Great Harmony Sect, you called us to discuss the matter of the crystal mine!"
<br><br>Numerous elders explained one after another.
<br><br>But it's okay not to speak.
<br><br>As soon as he said it, Li Hongtian stepped even more fiercely.
<br><br>"When did I ask you all to come to discuss the crystal mine?"
<br><br>"Do I know you guys?"
<br><br>"What the hell Dahua Sect, never even heard of it."
<br><br>"That's not right, is there a mistake?" That elder couldn't help but shout, "It was clearly your subordinates who came to inform us, huh?"
<br><br>Saying that, he glanced at his eyes and found the man who came to inform them of the Great Harmony Sect, and hurriedly went over to him and grabbed his palm and said, "Ask this general, he was the one who came to our Great Harmony Sect to inform us personally ah."
<br><br>"Did you go there?"
<br><br>Li Hongtian glared his eyes over.
<br><br>The subordinate's body kept and said categorically, "Report to the continental lord, no, what the hell Dahua clan, I have not even heard of it."
<br><br>"You heard of it?"
<br><br>"I, Li Hongtian, have never invited you guys, and I don't know you guys at all."
<br><br>"On the contrary, you guys, suddenly barging into my continental lord's residence, what should be the crime?"
<br><br>Li Hongtian's aura was revealed and crushed towards the crowd.
<br><br>Sensing Li Hongtian's aura, the elders of the Great Harmony Sect directly knelt on the ground in fear, their foreheads sweating coldly, not knowing what to do at all.
<br><br>"This, this, this, what the hell is going on!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we agreed to talk about the crystal mine, how did it suddenly become like this."
<br><br>"Who can tell me, in the end what happened ah!"
<br><br>A group of elders kneeled at Li Hongtian's feet, crying their faces out, trying to figure out why things had turned out this way.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>They stared in disbelief.
<br><br>Only to see Li Hongtian bowing and nodding to Lu Chong's front.
<br><br>"Aiyaya, Brother Lu, misunderstanding, what a misunderstanding!"
<br><br>"It's all my fault that I mismanaged this continental lord's mansion and let these curmudgeons barge in, that's why I offended you, I really deserve to die, I really deserve to die!"
<br><br>Said, Li Hongtian in his own face a heavy slap.
<br><br>Then said: "Brother Lu must not take this matter to heart, but do not affect the friendship between us."
<br><br>"These curmudgeons, I'll punish them severely right away."
<br><br>"Come on, men!"
<br><br>He said, "These people have trespassed into the residence of the Lord of the Continent and disturbed the distinguished guests of my residence, pull them down and put them in the heavenly prison."
<br><br>With these words, a group of personal soldiers of the Lord of the Continent surged up and detained Fang Scarf and the others on the ground.
<br><br>Fang Scarf and the others were already dumbfounded.
<br><br>Brother Lu?
<br><br>Your guest?
<br><br>Their eyes were so wide that they almost burst.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>"Continent Lord, he's just a waste, have you been hoodwinked?" Fang Scarf stared at them and shouted reluctantly.
<br><br>"You're the one who's a waste, your whole family is the one who's a waste."
<br><br>Li Hongtian slapped over, then stepped on Fang Scarf's chest, lowering his head and closing in.
<br><br>Only then did he leisurely transmit his voice: "You blind waste things, you really think he's a waste?"
<br><br>"He's a late True Element Immortal Realm expert, and he has a pair of top-tier immortal weapons in his hands!"
<br><br>"Such an expert, you guys don't even hold him up properly, but you actually expelled him from the sect?"
<br><br>"That's ridiculous!"
<br><br>Li Hongtian's voice transmission fell into the ears of Fang Scarf and the others.
<br><br>It was like an explosion of thunder.
<br><br>Lu Chong was not a waste?
<br><br>On the contrary it was still a late True Element Immortal Realm expert who possessed a top-tier immortal weapon.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>How is this possible?
<br><br>The crowd stared at them, completely unwilling to accept this fact.
<br><br>But the fact was in front of their eyes.
<br><br>They could not help but believe it.
<br><br>Otherwise, how could Li Hongtian, the titled Lord of the West Ning Immortal Continent, be so polite to Lu Chong?
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>Everyone's intestines turned blue with regret.
<br><br>Their faces were filled with remorse.
<br><br>They could see that Li Hongtian was willing to cooperate with the Great Harmony Sect on crystal mining because of Lu Chong.
<br><br>And now a big change in attitude towards them, also because of Lu Chong.
