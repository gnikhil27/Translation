Seeing that after the threat, Wu Tian remained silent, a cold smile spread across the faces of the two.
<br><br>I guess this Wu Tian was still afraid of the power of the Cloud Top Empire.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"I guess you should have figured it out, right?"
<br><br>"If you've figured it out, then be good and come back with us!"
<br><br>The two men raised the corners of their mouths, and teasing sounds came out.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as their voices fell, an appalling mighty energy collapsed overhead.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>Two people like carrying a big mountain, the underground stone slab steeply cracked, the body is cold sweat.
<br><br>See clearly. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Only to find that it was Wu Tian without warning towards them.
<br><br>The two men's faces changed greatly and shouted in a deep voice: "Wu Tian what are you doing, how dare you make a move on us, we are the emissaries of the Genting Empire, dare to commit a crime below, do you not want to live?"
<br><br>"Hmph, what's wrong with the emissaries, it's you who are killed!"
<br><br>Mid-air.
<br><br>Wu Tian emitted a wild and arrogant laugh.
<br><br>"And not only will I kill you all, in the future I will also kill the royal palace of the Cloud Top Empire!"
<br><br>"You dare?!"
<br><br>The two men stared and staggered, their trembling palms pointing at Wu Tian as they emitted angry voices.
<br><br>"You see if I dare!"
<br><br>In the midst of arrogant laughter, Wu Tian's thick palm print landed directly on top of the two men's heads.
<br><br>Then, under the eyes of countless people, the two were beaten into mush and turned into a puddle of blood, dying violently on the spot.
<br><br>"You, Lord Kun?"
<br><br>This scene simply shocked the crowd.
<br><br>As the people of the court, the people are not stupid, all guessed that the olive branch suddenly thrown by the Cloud Top Empire must have a demon.
<br><br>Even in the face of the two men's threat to the Wu Tian Empire, the crowd is also dare to anger not to say.
<br><br>But what can be done?
<br><br>Who called the two of them represent the Genting Empire?
<br><br>But they never expected that Wu Tian would actually dare to kill the two men.
<br><br>"Lord State Monarch, isn't this move a bit too impulsive?"
<br><br>"Yes, Lord State Monarch, if this matter were to spread back to the Genting Empire, I'm afraid it would bring a great disaster to the Wu Tian Empire!"
<br><br>In the court.
<br><br>Many courtiers couldn't help but voice out their worries.
<br><br>"What are you afraid of?"
<br><br>Wu Tian, who was at the top, waved his robe sleeve and said, "Although your worries are well-intentioned, I have to say, your pattern is too small!"
<br><br>"The pattern is small?"
<br><br>All the courtiers in the court were wide-eyed and did not understand what Wu Tian meant by that.
<br><br>"I hope that the sovereign will express it!"
<br><br>The crowd couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"My meaning is simple, that is, starting from today, our Wu Tian Empire will not only break away from the control of the Genting Empire, but also turn the Genting Empire into our territory."
<br><br>"And I, Wu Tian, will be the king of the Lingxu Realm!"
<br><br>A confident and domineering voice, interspersed with immortal energy, spread throughout the room.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>It could be said that a stone had set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>It made everyone choke for it.
<br><br>They all stared at each other with eyes full of disbelief.
<br><br>All of them were secretly wondering if Wu Tian was out of his mind.
<br><br>Although they are also called empires, but the Wu Tian Empire and the Genting Empire is not the same level, right?
<br><br>To turn the Genting Empire into the territory of the Wu Tian Empire, how much did he have to drink to say such words!
<br><br>It's not that the crowd didn't believe in Wu Tian.
<br><br>On the contrary, they revered Wu Tian and even regarded him as a kind of faith of Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>It's just that these words were just a little too unbelievable to say.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>The courtroom was full of discussion, and all kinds of questioning voices were heard.
<br><br>When Wu Tian saw this, he did not care at all, but waved his hand, and his vast aura overpowered the whole room.
<br><br>Under the silence, Wu Tian's leisurely voice came out.
<br><br>"I know you guys think this decision is a bit pie in the sky!"
<br><br>"But I might as well tell you guys plainly, the reason I made this decision is because of Mr.'s instructions!"
<br><br>"And there is no need to be afraid of offending the Genting Empire, because Mister and my big brother will completely back us up!"
<br><br>"Because just now, sir passed down the true words ......"
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>All the courtiers in the court looked towards Wu Tian, waiting for his later text, and their expressions, too, were full of expectation.
<br><br>Wu Tian deliberately sold off, when everyone in the field curiosity to the extreme, he only raised the corner of his mouth, continued to pass out a thick voice.
<br><br>"Sir probably means - do not be afraid to encounter things, do it and be done with it!"
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>The courtyard crowd's gloomy expressions were all dispersed, replaced by excitement and excitement.
<br><br>Since that Milk Dose Daxian, an ass to the four sides of the water, but from time to time jump out to mess up the wind language empire destroyed, they have long been Yi Feng and skeleton Ben Wei a few like a god!
<br><br>Not to mention, the previous seven women had really achieved the Supreme Bone after refining Bone Ben Wei's bone fragments.
<br><br>So if this is really the instruction of the gentleman, then there is still a fear of the Genting Empire's eggs!
<br><br>"Lord King, I agree with your idea, fuck the Genting Empire!"
<br><br>"Yes, I also support it!"
<br><br>"It's better to send troops now, I'll take the lead!"
<br><br>All at once, all kinds of enthusiastic and agitated voices came out.
<br><br>That appearance was actually more impatient than Wu Tian, who wanted to fight to the palace of the Genting Empire right now and rip off the head of the Genting king.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I appreciate you guys!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Tian also laughed out loud and said leisurely, "So now you guys tell me, what does it count if I kill two messengers?"
<br><br>"Lord King is right, killing two messengers is really nothing."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, that is, only two came, if only two more came, so that I could also go out and get one killed myself!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>At this time, under the warm atmosphere, another person came out and said, "The king, I have another plan!"
<br><br>"Oh, you speak?"
<br><br>Wu Tian asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"I suggest that we directly transport the bodies of these two people back and hang them on the city tower of the Genting Empire's palace!"
<br><br>"In this way, we can express our determination to declare war on the Genting Empire!"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Wu Tian's eyes snapped open and he slapped his thighs and stood up violently.
<br><br>"Good note, what a good note!"
<br><br>Wu Tian could not wait to do so.
<br><br>If set aside in the past, who would dare to do this, who would dare to provoke the Cloud Top Empire like this?
<br><br>Then he, Wu Tian, was going to do so today.
<br><br>This is his first step towards a big pattern ......
<br><br>Touche.
<br><br>I'm sure if Mr. knew about it, he wouldn't be disappointed in him anymore!
