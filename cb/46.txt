"What?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie's action can be said to have stimulated everyone's nerves.
<br><br>Especially Luo Lan Xue and Yin Luo Li, their hearts were stuck in their throats. They were not afraid that something would happen to Yi Feng, after all, they also had to have that ability in Yu Wu Jie.
<br><br>They are afraid that Yu Wujie will offend Yi Feng and thus anger the whole Qingshan Sect.
<br><br>To know that the old ancestor of Qingshan carefully maintained the relationship with Yi Feng, fearing that there was something negligent, if really let Yu Wujie this sword cut down, then it would be a foregone conclusion.
<br><br>The Qingshan Sect is afraid that it will also face the disaster of extinction.
<br><br>"Stop."
<br><br>Almost at the same time, Yin Luo Li and Luo Lan Xue made their moves, one after the other, and two thick palm imprints slapped towards Yu Wu Jie.
<br><br>"Master ......"
<br><br>Seeing that it was the two women, Yu Wujie's face was also startled, after all, according to the generation, the two women were much higher than him, but before he could address them, he met the attack of the two women head-on.
<br><br>"Bump!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Two palms, directly knocked Yu Wujie away and hit the ground heavily.
<br><br>"Division ......"
<br><br>Yu Wujie climbed up and was about to speak, but was greeted by another heaven-destroying attack from the two women.
<br><br>It is hard to imagine the anger in their hearts at this moment, and they are also afraid to consider the consequences of this matter. Other than that, if the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak knows about this matter, I am afraid it will cause a big earthquake in the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>Just as he sat up, Yu Wujie was slapped away again, and his mouth was spitting blood in a wail.
<br><br>"I... Why did you attack me?"
<br><br>He was full of incomprehension.
<br><br>But the words just fell, Luo Lan Xue jade hand, a green sleeve like a long snake drawn out to wrap around Yu Wu Jie's neck, directly lifting him up in the air.
<br><br>"Green Mountain Palm."
<br><br>He was in the air when Yin Luo Li flipped her jade palm and a thick palm print was slapped directly on Yu Wujie's chest.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Yu Wujie let out a miserable cry, his chest caved in and he fell to the ground heavily.
<br><br>This still did not make the two women's anger subside, and three feet of clear wind was drawn out from the two women's sleeves and forced straight to Yu Wujie's neck.
<br><br>On the other hand, Peng Ying's scared little face was white, her hands covered her red lips for a while, and she didn't know what to do, nor did she understand at all what had happened and why it was like this.
<br><br>The light in Yi Feng's eyes shone instead.
<br><br>It was the first time he had seen a practitioner strike so close up, and it was really strong!
<br><br>Especially this Luo Lan Xue, who looks quite powerful, it's not in vain that the old man of Qingshan didn't even have to eat to send her to cultivate!
<br><br>I have to say that the two women are still quite moved by the fact that they took a shot at him.
<br><br>"Kneel down."
<br><br>Ice cold voices came out from the mouths of the two women, not suspecting in the slightest that the next moment would directly take Yu Wujie's life.
<br><br>"I, what exactly did I do wrong?"
<br><br>With blood dripping from his mouth, Yu Wujie's eyes were confused and his breath was depressed as he looked at the two women, asking unwillingly, "Although you two are senior to me, you can't bully people like this, right?
<br><br>"Still dare to talk tough?"
<br><br>Hearing these words, the two women became angry.
<br><br>What else did he do wrong? He almost wiped out the Qingshan Sect with that sword, and this big mistake actually did not have a repentant heart, the two women slapped Yu Wu Jie's face without giving the slightest face.
<br><br>In a moment, Yu Wujie was directly beaten into a pig's head by the two women and lay dying on the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two women hurried back to Yi Feng and said with apologies on their faces, "Sir, I am really sorry to have frightened you."
<br><br>After finishing the sentence, the two women lowered their heads.
<br><br>Yin Xiong and the others at the side also didn't dare to breathe a word, who could have expected that such an accident had occurred.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Peng Ying, who was on the side, saw this scene and was violently shocked.
