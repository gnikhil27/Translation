The only remaining Yi Feng with skeleton Ben Wei and the dog continued to rush.
<br><br>Finally is into the 100,000 big mountains.
<br><br>Here the jungle is dense, the ground is full of withered leaves, it can be seen that there are few people in this mountain.
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng's voice transmission jade brief came to Desolation Wuji news.
<br><br>The woman who robbed the embroidered ball was terrifying and was coming after them.
<br><br>"Damn it's in big trouble."
<br><br>Yi Feng had a bad look on his face.
<br><br>Although he had entered the hundred thousand mountains, but this place was still in the territory of Nansha.
<br><br>So in other people's territory Yi Feng is really no bottom, in case they are caught back to break their legs what to do?
<br><br>Under the anxiety, Yi Feng finally thought of a good way, directly put the skeleton Ben Wei into the ring of space.
<br><br>And looking at the dense jungle, Yi Feng thought of simply put the dog also loaded in. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After all, the dog has been raised for so long has long had feelings, in case in this mountain inside run lost, or caught by the beast to eat also can not say.
<br><br>A bone a dog into the ring of space, Yi Feng a person lightly loaded on the trip.
<br><br>But Yi Feng had not gone far, his steps were a jolt.
<br><br>The face also became grave.
<br><br>"Rustle rustle ......"
<br><br>Because not far away, there was a slight sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly knew that it was the sound made by something stepping on the dry yellow leaves.
<br><br>There was no doubt.
<br><br>Something was approaching him.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood in place and held his breath, casually picked up a wooden stick from the ground and held it tightly in his hand.
<br><br>Finally, there was movement from the leaves next to the tree.
<br><br>Then from behind the leaves, a big, mighty head came through.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>With a hissing roar, it immediately shook the mountain forest.
<br><br>It was a majestic male lion.
<br><br>It was quite a bit bigger than the lion in its previous life, with a body a foot long and half a foot high, revealing sharp teeth full of sharpness, sniffing the scent of Yi Feng's living man, with even more saliva coming out of its mouth.
<br><br>"Damn, big trouble."
<br><br>Yi Feng tightly gripped the wooden stick in his hand, also never expected to come across a big guy as soon as he came in.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>There is a vicious battle is going to happen.
<br><br>Gradually, Yi Feng has bent down and made a fighting gesture.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>Finally, along with a roar, the majestic lion with the momentum of lightning, then pounced towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>And Yi Feng hand gaze also fierce swing, one person and one lion is about to fight together.
<br><br>Suddenly!
<br><br>A dazzling light appeared in mid-air, carrying a strong air-breaking sound, chopped down from the dome of the sky.
<br><br>This sudden appearance of light, immediately let Yi Feng stunned.
<br><br>Because this light is actually a sword shadow, the whole sword shadow is thousands of feet long, and has the speed of light.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart immediately flooded with waves of shock.
<br><br>Such an awesome scene, the previous life of the movie can only see ah.
<br><br>And also have to be the kind of big production of the film to have, at least 50 cents special effects is not the whole out.
<br><br>However, this sword light, but not special effects, but the real.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Almost in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>The sword light has chopped down and landed not far from Yi Feng.
<br><br>Then Yi Feng was shocked to see that the lion that was attacking him, under this sword directly flew into oblivion, not even a hair fell off.
<br><br>Of course, the ground also left a gully hundreds of feet long.
<br><br>Looking at this scene, Yi Feng drew a cold breath.
<br><br>The heart could not slow down for a long time, while the sword just now, still in his mind for a long time.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>The sound of breaking wind rose, and a silhouette came flashing in the sky, and the airflow of the whole space changed as a result.
<br><br>A few moments later, it had reached the top of Yi Feng's head.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly looked up and was shocked to find a breathtakingly beautiful woman.
<br><br>A pair of bare jade feet standing in the air ......
<br><br>She has exquisite features tall, revealing fair and flawless skin, long hair three thousand down to the waist, like a river of stars in general bright.
<br><br>Under the white fluttering, gauze skirt without wind, like a fairy who does not eat fire and smoke.
<br><br>Body side of the hand holding a long sword, a horrifying actually if not emanating out ......
<br><br>Have to say.
<br><br>Whether this woman's beauty or strength, will Yi Feng to shocked.
<br><br>He was sure that this woman must be stronger than the martial spirit!
<br><br>"Many thanks to the girl for saving me!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cupped his fist and said, although he also had some confidence in finishing off this lion, but the person had saved himself a lot of effort after all.
<br><br>The woman's pretty eyebrows moved, looking at Yi Feng said lightly: "You a mortal, how can you appear here?"
<br><br>"Oh, it's a long story, I was going to cross the hundred thousand mountains and then pass through the Shade Mountain Range to reach Pingjiang City." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Through the hundred thousand mountains?"
<br><br>Hearing this, even with the mind of the woman in white, her eyes couldn't help but jump.
<br><br>"This, what's the problem girl?" Yi Feng scratched his head and asked.
<br><br>"You'd better go back to where you came from, you can't go through the mountain range, just now a beast let you enough, there will be something you can't imagine inside the mountain." The woman in white said admonishingly.
<br><br>"This, I have wilderness survival experience, should still be able to."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, since he was ready to go into the mountains, he was not unprepared, such as poison needles, poison are prepared a lot.
<br><br>This is why Yi Feng just ran into a lion, although the gaze but did not panic.
<br><br>The woman in white looked at Yi Feng, can not say what look, then the jade feet gently move, the whole figure into a stream of light, disappeared in the sky ......
<br><br>Yi Feng was just about to open his mouth to continue to say thank you, but found that she had long disappeared.
<br><br>This instantly made Yi Feng smile bitterly.
<br><br>I'm afraid that in the eyes of this kind of cultivator, a mortal like him is just a molehill.
