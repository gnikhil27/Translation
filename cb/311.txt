The woman in white looked at Yi Feng dumbfounded.
<br><br>The anger in the heart rolled straight.
<br><br>She made up her mind that even if she crawled away or died here, she would not get on Yi Feng's shoulders.
<br><br>However, what he did not expect was that Yi Feng, without saying a word, directly drew a stick over and landed on the back of her head.
<br><br>The already weak, and cultivation an empty she immediately dizzy head, should fall to the ground.
<br><br>"Fucking grind, this does not even look at where this is."
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed and dropped the stick in his hand, a grabbed the woman in white on his shoulder and left the place.
<br><br>In a cave.
<br><br>The fire light lingered.
<br><br>The woman in white just woke up from her coma, remembering what happened before, her pretty face was covered with frost.
<br><br>But she just opened her eyes, but found Yi Feng holding her long sword, resting on her neck. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Have a chat?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a condescending manner.
<br><br>"Say what?"
<br><br>The woman said with an icy face.
<br><br>"What I want to say is, first of all, I have no intention to offend you, and knock you out because I have no choice, at night the beasts are rampant, I do not want to lose my life because of your involvement." Yi Feng said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Then you can completely ignore me." The woman said indifferently.
<br><br>"I can leave you alone, but I am a man of clear grudges, before you helped me to take out a lion, is also considered to be kind to me, so I saved you." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>The woman opened her mouth, did not know how to respond.
<br><br>"Of course, saving you is saving you, now that it's safe, we also have to make things clear." Yi Feng said, "So I don't care if you hold a grudge against me for knocking you out before, but you have to promise not to kill me, because no matter what, I am your savior."
<br><br>The woman pondered slightly.
<br><br>Although this mortal was hateful and for a few moments did move her to kill, she had to admit that this mortal was indeed the benefactor of her life.
<br><br>"I promise you."
<br><br>She nodded.
<br><br>"Then you have to swear, swear a poisonous oath, swear with your cultivation, and your dao heart, and your whole family." Yi Feng added, saying almost all the poisonous oaths he guessed would be effective for cultivators.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>The woman in white had an ugly look on her face.
<br><br>But looking at Yi Feng's firm look, she only gritted her teeth and nodded.
<br><br>Then in front of Yi Feng, she swore all the poisonous oaths that Yi Feng could think of.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded in satisfaction before dropping the longsword in his hand and sitting on his butt.
<br><br>"Let's talk about it again, what's next." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"You say."
<br><br>The woman in white looked at him and said.
<br><br>"You are given two choices."
<br><br>Yi Feng said: "First, we go our separate ways, do not owe each other, this is my more happy choice, but I also have to lay out the facts with you clearly, now your cultivation is sealed, and no different from mortals, and also injured, you are afraid that you will not last long, either die of thirst and hunger, or be eaten by wild animals, and then become ......"
<br><br>"Okay you do not say."
<br><br>Knowing that Yi Feng again to say she will become a turd, she quickly interrupted: "Say a second choice?"
<br><br>"OK, the second choice is that you follow me, but then you have to unconditionally obey my arrangements, no pushing, no ink." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"You want me to listen to you, a mortal?" She asked incredulously.
<br><br>"Yes, and also unconditionally."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded solemnly, picked up the long sword aside and said, "Of course, next, this sword of yours is also temporarily given to me to use, I also have a competent weapon when I encounter a beast."
<br><br>"The sword to you for temporary use does not matter, but want me to listen to you, it is impossible!"
<br><br>She shook her head icily, with a resolute look.
<br><br>"Then there is no more talk, let's go our separate ways!"
<br><br>Yi Feng spread his hands and dropped his longsword on the ground again, and started to prepare to pack up his things and leave.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The woman in white was furious, her face red and her teeth clenched tightly.
<br><br>But she had to admit that she needed Yi Feng a lot.
<br><br>If Yi Feng left, with her current state, I'm afraid she would really die a miserable death.
<br><br>"Okay, I promise you."
<br><br>Finally, she hesitated for a long time, and only then tightly bit her red lips and agreed with a face full of reluctance.
<br><br>"How good it is to promise earlier, causing me to pick up and go."
<br><br>Yi Feng gave her a white glance without good humor, and picked up the long sword on the ground again, and looked at it with anticipation.
<br><br>At that time, he remembered how awesome this sword was.
<br><br>Just that one stroke ......
<br><br>With just a swish, a good-sized sword light appeared.
<br><br>"By the way, you should be a little stronger than a martial spirit, right?" Yi Feng asked while observing the longsword.
<br><br>"Martial spirit?"
<br><br>The woman in white was stunned, then nodded her head.
<br><br>"It seems that you are indeed a master."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded solemnly and said, "But don't underestimate me, once I also stayed with Martial Spirit for a while and saw his power with my own eyes, to say the least, we are also half friends!"
<br><br>The woman in white brushed aside her frost-covered pretty face, with a hint of disdain hidden in her eyes.
<br><br>"By the way, you said you were fighting with demonic beasts before, you mean there are demonic beasts inside this mountain?" Yi Feng suddenly remembered what was important and asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"You have not encountered?"
<br><br>The woman in white asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Of course I have not encountered ah, otherwise why I ask you?" Yi Feng asked rhetorically.
<br><br>The woman in white was stunned, then asked, "I remember you said that you were going to cross the 100,000 Great Mountains to Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head and said.
<br><br>"Isn't there an official road, why didn't you take the official road?" The woman in white asked.
<br><br>"There are many mountain bandits on that way." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"So you mean that you planned to cross the 100,000 mountains in order to avoid the mountain bandits?" The woman in white looked at Yi Feng in surprise.
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>"In my opinion, it's much safer inside this mountain than on that road."
<br><br>Yi Feng was busy nodding his head and said.
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the white-clothed woman's face couldn't say what kind of look was on her face, and in her heart she couldn't help but say, "What kind of oddball did this touch?
<br><br>Actually would think that the hundred thousand mountains than the official road to be safe?
