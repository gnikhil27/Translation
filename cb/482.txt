"Yo."
<br><br>"This loser is back yet."
<br><br>"Haha, it's really this trash."
<br><br>Seeing Xiao Zhan appear, many people passed out disdainful sounds, waiting to see a good show.
<br><br>And when Liu Ruyan saw the youth appear, she also lifted her head to look.
<br><br>Looked at this fianc√© she had never seen before.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>After just a glance, she did not pay more attention, but spoke plainly: "Since you are back, please hurry up and make a decision!"
<br><br>At these words, Xiao Zhan clenched his teeth to death, stared back at Liu Ruyan, and questioned soberly, "Miss Liu, although you and I have been betrothed since childhood, I have never met you, and even though you have great achievements in the future, I, Xiao Zhan, have never coveted you, let alone had any affection for you, so even if I have to withdraw from the marriage, there is nothing I am unwilling to do."
<br><br>"But!"
<br><br>"Withdrawal of marriage is withdrawing, what do you mean by calling so many people today, is it a deliberate attempt to humiliate my Xiao family, a deliberate attempt to humiliate my father?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Liu Ruyan slightly raised her head and looked at Xiao Yun.
<br><br>"Mr. Xiao, you misunderstood, I did not mean to humiliate you, I just wanted to invite everyone to be a witness, after all, all of you here are the forces near Tianxing City, and have always known about my Xiao and Liu families." Liu Ruyan said indifferently.
<br><br>"Witness, witness what?"
<br><br>"Witness my Xiao family being withdrawn from marriage?"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan said with red eyes, "At least our two families used to be considered worldly friends, really counted my Xiao family has also given you a favor to the Liu family, where will you put my Xiao family, where will my father put?"
<br><br>"I said, you misunderstood, at the same time, please do not open your mouth and shut your mouth to talk about the kindness."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan explained with an expressionless face.
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>She took out a delicate jade box, followed by a lustrous rippling longsword.
<br><br>"In the box, is a mid-grade elixir, Tong Xian Dan."
<br><br>"This sword, is an intermediate level immortal weapon, the Kasumi Sword."
<br><br>"There is also a storage ring with a large amount of resources inside."
<br><br>"As long as you agree to withdraw from the marriage, you can take all these things."
<br><br>"So what I said about witnessing is just wanting everyone to know that my Liu family is not that insensitive, let alone the kind that disowns people when they soar, even if I withdraw from your marriage, I will still give you the Xiao family the corresponding compensation."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan said indifferently.
<br><br>When Liu Ruyan's words fell, the crowd in the field immediately exclaimed.
<br><br>"It's actually an intermediate level Immortal Pill."
<br><br>"Yes, there's also the intermediate level immortal weapon, the Heavenly Spirit Sect is worthy of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, it's really a big deal!"
<br><br>The crowd's eyes were flooded with green light.
<br><br>They had to know that they did not have a single low-grade immortal weapon in their hands, let alone a mid-grade immortal weapon.
<br><br>If they had such treasures as the Kasumi Sword, they would be able to fight across levels.
<br><br>It is enough to see.
<br><br>The weight of intermediate level immortal weapons.
<br><br>"Xiao Zhan, you said that your Xiao family can, don't get ahead of yourself, Miss Liu has given you intermediate level immortal weapons and intermediate level immortal pills, what more do you want."
<br><br>"That's right, you don't look at what a waste you Xiao Zhan is, worthy of Miss Liu Ruyan, don't be a scoundrel and delay the reputation of others."
<br><br>"Yes, hurry up and agree with Miss Liu, she has been so kind to you!"
<br><br>Another chattering sound came from the crowd.
<br><br>"Well, well, what a good tactic!"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan at this moment simply pinched his fingernails into the flesh, his eyes flickered with intense hatred, as well as intense reluctance.
<br><br>He hated.
<br><br>Hated himself for not having the strength.
<br><br>If he had enough strength, at this moment, his father and son, how would he be subjected to such a shame?
<br><br>Liu Ruyan this action.
<br><br>Undoubtedly is a whore but also set up a plaque.
<br><br>Originally his Xiao family has never been reluctant to withdraw from the marriage, and does not even need any compensation.
<br><br>But a thousand times should not, Liu Ruyan to step on their Xiao family at the same time, but also to her Liu family to establish a good persona.
<br><br>"This marriage, I will not withdraw."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan gritted his teeth and passed out his voice word by word.
<br><br>The only thing he could do was this.
<br><br>Even if it means death!
<br><br>If this marriage was withdrawn, then his Xiao family would never be able to raise their heads in the Lingxu Realm, and his father, as well as the entire Xiao family, would live under the ridicule of others for the rest of their lives.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan's eyes narrowed.
<br><br>"Are you afraid that what I gave you is not enough?" She asked in a deep voice, and a strong and powerful pressure attacked towards Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>"I don't need your things, but to withdraw from the marriage, it's impossible!" Xiao Zhan's single figure faced Liu Nan Yan's intimidating pressure and passed out a firm figure.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Liu Ruyan snorted and sneered, "I know that your heart is very upset, and this matter does have an element of humiliation for your Xiao family, but you should understand that this world is originally a world where the strongest are the most important, and it is inherently unfair!"
<br><br>"If we were to change positions today, and you were far stronger than me in terms of talent and strength, you could also come to my Heavenly Spirit Sect to withdraw your marriage, and I, Liu Ruyan, would have nothing to say."
<br><br>"So you, why do you have to continue to be obsessed?"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan clenched his teeth with a deadly grit, filled with hatred and unwillingness for his lack of strength.
<br><br>The current him.
<br><br>Why did he not want to change his position and trample Liu Ruyan under his feet?
<br><br>"Is it that you want to prove yourself very much?"
<br><br>Looking at Xiao Zhan's appearance, Liu Ruyan said expressionlessly, "I can give you a chance to prove yourself."
<br><br>"Of course, it's mainly because of the past friendship between our two families, and I don't want to make too much of an embarrassment between them."
<br><br>"Therefore I give you three years, three years, I wait for you in the Heavenly Spirit Sect, if you are stronger than me, I Liu Nan Yan is not in the withdrawal, and to you as a cow, at your disposal."
<br><br>"But if you if you are not lower, then I will break the marriage contract with you in public!"
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>Liu Ruyan looked at Xiao Zhan indifferently, waiting for Xiao Zhan's response.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan's body trembled and his face was filled with a bitter smile.
<br><br>How could he not see that this woman was expecting that he would not achieve anything in three years, and even if he did, he would not be able to surpass him at all.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>One is the wasteful son of a small family.
<br><br>One is the heavenly daughter of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>How can they compare?
<br><br>And once the three years are up, she has both withdrawn from the marriage contract and gained fame, and will not be more likely to fall into the reputation of tearing down the bridge.
<br><br>As for him, Xiao Zhan, he will bear the shame and live forever in the ridicule of others.
<br><br>This is really a good tactic!
<br><br>Just when Xiao Zhan was filled with powerlessness and did not know what to do, an icy cold voice suddenly came from outside.
<br><br>"What are you?"
<br><br>"How dare you say three years, you think too highly of yourself."
<br><br>"Let you kneel before my senior brother as a cow and horse, three days are enough!"
<br><br>The voice fell, and a group of people slowly walked in, led by a woman with a cold and arrogant face and white clothes that looked like snow.
