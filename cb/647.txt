Seemingly afraid that Lu Chong did not believe, he hurriedly raised his palm again and said, "I swear!"
<br><br>Li Hongtian's set of tactics, the whole Lu Chong two people do not know what to do.
<br><br>It was so easy to return strong from a month of training at Shadow Island.
<br><br>But damn it.
<br><br>A fist hit on cotton.
<br><br>Simply depressed.
<br><br>"You, hall a continent master, we hit the door, you do not have half a temper?"
<br><br>Lu Chong asked in bewilderment.
<br><br>"Because I have always convinced people with virtue."
<br><br>Li Hongtian responded with a straight face.
<br><br>Hearing that. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Gong Chen and Lu Chong's mouths tugged.
<br><br>That look at Li Hongtian's gaze, as if to say: look I believe you.
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>"Ahem."
<br><br>Li Hongtian awkwardly coughed twice and said with a red face, "Well, I'll be honest, I feel like I might not be able to offend you."
<br><br>"Because at your age, being able to reach this kind of strength is simply beyond the imagination of ordinary people, so behind you, there must be someone you can't afford to mess with!"
<br><br>The two Gong Chen's eyes were raised.
<br><br>For Li Hongtian to say these words, not only did not look down on him.
<br><br>On the contrary, they looked up two points.
<br><br>As the saying goes, those who know the times are handsome, he is this vision alone, I am afraid that the future achievements will not be low.
<br><br>Sure enough, he deserves to be the lord of a continent.
<br><br>"You are very smart."
<br><br>Lu Chong sighed in admiration.
<br><br>"I'm sorry to laugh."
<br><br>Li Hongtian laughed, "But at this age, you have such achievements, I guess that senior behind you has spent a lot of effort on your body?"
<br><br>"You think too much."
<br><br>Lu Chong laughed bitterly, "Where am I qualified to have sir put effort on me, besides, I am just at the bottom of our place."
<br><br>These words fell on Li Hongtian's ears.
<br><br>It instantly made Li Hongtian's mouth tremble.
<br><br>Because no matter what, for whether or not there was someone behind Lu Chong, it was only his guess.
<br><br>So he just said that, in fact, with the element of probing.
<br><br>To confirm, Lu Chong's behind is not such an expert.
<br><br>But the result of this test, completely made him unsettled.
<br><br>"You, you mean, you have more than one like this, and you are still the bottom of the pile?"
<br><br>He asked with glaring eyes.
<br><br>A shocking wave was raised in his heart.
<br><br>At Lu Chong's age, yet he had the True Element Immortal Realm, this kind of talent thrown in the Immortal Realm was an existence that would make any holy land fight for it.
<br><br>Even the Heaven's Immortal Hall may throw an olive branch.
<br><br>But in his mouth, there is more than one?
<br><br>He was still at the bottom of the list?
<br><br>This completely unsettled him.
<br><br>"Of course there are many."
<br><br>"After all, we are so big there, the odd jobs, the dung pickers, the grassroots who do hard labor are certainly not in the minority!" Lu Chong said indifferently.
<br><br>?
<br><br>Li Hongtian was directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>His face was full of question marks.
<br><br>"Handyman?"
<br><br>"A manure picker?"
<br><br>"Those who do hard labor?"
<br><br>"???"
<br><br>"Brother Lu, you're not joking with me?"
<br><br>"What's the problem?" Lu Chong responded, "I am a dung-picker at Mr. Although this occupation would seem to outsiders to be quite degrading, for us, it is a source of pride."
<br><br>"It is also the greatest opportunity in this life!"
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>The more Lu Chong said, the more energetic, but also the more excited.
<br><br>A time is unable to resist the emotion, slightly under the head, actually a face of pride.
<br><br>But the side of Li Hongtian but listened to the heart thumping.
<br><br>He has lived for so many years.
<br><br>Is not the truth, is not bragging, he can still hear it.
<br><br>Even if he felt that what Lu Chong said was too vanilla, too heavenly, but he also felt that the truth seemed to be the same as what Lu Chong said, eight or nine times.
<br><br>"Brother Lu, oh no, brother Lu, is there any interest in coming to my brother's residence for a get-together?" Li Hongtian bent his waist, made an inviting gesture, and said with a smile.
<br><br>Gong Chen's face was full of discomfort, and he couldn't help but pull up his beard.
<br><br>What kind of thing is this?
<br><br>I thought I could fight and see the power of his nephew's top-notch bucket of shit.
<br><br>In the end, under Li Hongtian's generous invitation, Lu Chong and Gong Chen still flew towards the continental lord's residence.
<br><br>"Please!"
<br><br>At the entrance of the continental lord's residence, Li Hongtian was enthusiastic to the extreme.
<br><br>"Master, you, why are you?"
<br><br>At this time, Li Qingxuan, who was full of wretchedness, rushed back clutching his chest and shouted hysterically, "I am your disciple, ah, why are you ......"
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>Just finished, Li Hongtian kicked her out, "Laozi has no time to take care of you, go back to your Thousand Seekers Sect."
<br><br>After saying that, he hurriedly stroked his clothes again and said with a smile, "Two big brothers quickly please please please."
<br><br>After Gong Chen and Lu Chong walked into the continental lord's residence.
<br><br>Li Hongtian hurriedly said to his subordinates, "Immediately send an order to invite the top brass of the Great Harmonization Sect to come over, remember, be polite, say that they are invited to come over to discuss how to develop the mineral crystals within the West Ning Immortal Continent."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, several subordinates immediately rushed towards the Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>After ordering everything, Li Hongtian prepared another banquet to entertain both Lu Chong and Gong Chen.
<br><br>"Aiya, elder brother Gong Chen, brother Lu, the three of us really know each other at first sight!"
<br><br>"Poor hospitality, poor hospitality, please don't take offense."
<br><br>"This cup, I drink first."
<br><br>Li Hongtian drank freely.
<br><br>After drinking a few cups, he pulled the stool and sat down again, close to Lu Chong.
<br><br>"Brother Lu ah, I want to ask you, you said that place, in the end what is the place ah?" Li Hongtian couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"This, not our people, it is not convenient to tell." Lu Chong lifted his glass of wine and took a small sip, then said lightly, "But for the sake of your bowl of wine, I can give you a few pieces of future advice!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"My little brother is all ears."
<br><br>Li Hongtian was sitting.
<br><br>Opened his ears.
<br><br>"In the future in the immortal world, never mess with people, especially human immortals and earth immortals." Lu Chong solemnly explained.
<br><br>"?"
<br><br>"Don't mess with Human Immortals and Earth Immortals?"
<br><br>Li Hongtian was instantly confused and asked, "Please make it clearer, Brother Lu."
<br><br>"Some words can only point to the end, as the saying goes, heavenly information can not be revealed, know more, it is not good for you." Lu Chong solemnly said, "You just need to take this statement of mine to heart!"
