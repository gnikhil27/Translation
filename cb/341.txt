Seeing the crowd really want to leave.
<br><br>The three of them immediately became anxious, and Ye Bei even shouted in a trembling voice, "I promise, if you guys go, you will definitely regret it."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Even if that person is really as powerful as you guys say, we don't have this patience to wait any longer."
<br><br>"That's right, so there is no way that there is any possibility of regret or not."
<br><br>The crowd had black faces.
<br><br>Already no longer listened to any words of Ye Bei and others.
<br><br>With their status, they had come a long way to this shitty place, and not flipping out with Ye Bei and the others was already generous enough.
<br><br>So, some people are already swept away.
<br><br>After the martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the large open space. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Originally this piece of land is intended to let WuYongHong a few old men to open up to grow land, now to get the sect, it seems that this kind of land matter can only be temporarily shelved.
<br><br>"I don't know how the old men are doing, they said they went home for something and haven't come back for so long."
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed slightly, then took out the ring of space hidden in his bosom.
<br><br>The reason why it was placed in the bosom, and not on the finger, is also Yi Feng thought of the reasoning of the wistfulness.
<br><br>After all, it is a storage ring, in case which person takes him as a tycoon, to rob him will be a problem.
<br><br>So low profile, put in the arms is the way.
<br><br>"Let you out, suffocating me would be a waste of effort."
<br><br>Yi Feng gently twisted the spatial ring, and then four beasts he captured were released by him.
<br><br>A big black bird.
<br><br>A one-horned, similar to the rhinoceros body, but not a rhinoceros thing.
<br><br>A deer-shaped state, but with a dog's head four unlike.
<br><br>The last one is not much better, is a dog not dog wolf not wolf thing.
<br><br>Anyway, these four beasts, Yi Feng not one can call out the name.
<br><br>But what the heck.
<br><br>Barking loud enough to deter people on the line.
<br><br>"Disciple, disciple ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted, "Bring out those chains from my ironworking room."
<br><br>"It's Master, coming!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing answered inside the martial arts school and ran over with a few big thick chains in tow.
<br><br>"Bolt them on."
<br><br>Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing obediently used the chains to bolt the four beasts.
<br><br>And in the next moment after Zhong Qing finished bolting the chains, the four beasts coincidentally woke up.
<br><br>They first looked at each other, and when they found themselves chained up, they burst out in anger.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"Whoa!"
<br><br>Four different voices immediately resounded throughout the space.
<br><br>Subsequently.
<br><br>Four monstrous pressures emanated from the bodies of the four beasts.
<br><br>Any one of these four mighty pressures caused people to feel chills and tremble in their hearts and souls.
<br><br>Especially that one high-pitched bird call, but also like a hammer in the heavy blow to the chest, transmitting a burst of stuffy feeling.
<br><br>Also at this moment.
<br><br>Many people in Pingjiang City, cast their eyes in this direction.
<br><br>"This pressure, tsk, it seems to be a demon immortal level ah!"
<br><br>"No, even a demon immortal can't escape the poisonous hand of a gentleman!"
<br><br>"I just don't know if mister is using it for food this time, or for fun."
<br><br>"You guys blindly compare why, sell your tofu, have lived here for several years, this kind of thing is rare, what's the big deal?"
<br><br>"Yes, calm down!"
<br><br>Several old men and women gathered together, emitting chattering voices, and then dispersed in a flurry, the one who should sell tofu sells tofu, the one who should sell rouge sells rouge.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The people who just left from Ye Bei and others, hearing the sound and the pressure that spread out, their faces changed greatly.
<br><br>While luckily suppressing the pressure, they turned back with a shocked look.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"Just now this pressure, and this roar, what is going on?"
<br><br>The crowd's faces were shocked and horrified, and their voices were transmitted towards Ye Bei and the others in a condensed question.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"What do you think is going on?"
<br><br>"What else can it be but the means of Mr.?"
<br><br>Seeing the group of people turn back, Ye Bei and the others immediately raised their proud heads with a stinky look on their faces.
<br><br>I knew it.
<br><br>Mr. casually show a hand, you group of yakuza will have to run back with their butts up.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The people have looked at each other.
<br><br>Look a little ugly.
<br><br>Before, they might have really looked away, this one might really be a super expert.
<br><br>Because the pressure just now, was too powerful.
<br><br>So powerful that they, the group of martial dwellers, could hardly even breathe.
<br><br>It seemed that in order to see what was going on, they rushed towards Yi Feng in a swarm.
<br><br>"Hey hey, old pipsqueak you guys stop, don't rush the gentleman."
<br><br>Ye Bei several people shouted, while also hurriedly followed.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>The four demonic beasts were looking at Yi Feng with murderous intent, hating to eat Yi Feng's flesh and blood.
<br><br>What makes them even more unacceptable is that at this moment, they have been completely suppressed cultivation, any means can not be exercised, even if they want to speak, they simply can not open their mouths.
<br><br>Especially the immortal realm down to the mortal black feather, but also desperately struggling.
<br><br>He titled the immortal world black feather, the great demon of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, actually in this low-level lower realm, was bolted with a chain, how can he endure.
<br><br>Shame.
<br><br>It was simply a great shame!
<br><br>He flapped his wings and tried to take off to break free, but the chain was tightly bolted to him, making it impossible for him to break free.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"Whoa!"
<br><br>Four more angry roars came out, indicating the anger in the hearts of the four demonic beasts.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What made their hearts break their defenses was that this human was not afraid at all in the face of their hissing.
<br><br>On the contrary.
<br><br>In front of their faces jumped up.
<br><br>And jumped super happy.
<br><br>"Give strength to give strength."
<br><br>"This roar, too powerful."
<br><br>"Really didn't catch you guys for nothing, give me a few more sounds."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted with a face full of excitement.
<br><br>Provocation.
<br><br>Barefaced provocation.
<br><br>Four beasts monstrous anger, hissing sound, the body pressure is more wave after wave of release.
<br><br>And rushed to Ye Bei and others, just in time to see this scene.
<br><br>The three demonic beasts' original appearance, coupled with this superb pressure, seemed to be ......
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>The three great demon immortals of the Western Demon Forest?
<br><br>An instant.
<br><br>They were collectively petrified in place.
<br><br>Completely dumbfounded.
<br><br>The eyes almost fell off.
<br><br>One should know that although the continent is large, there are very few that can reach the peak, and those that can enter into immortality are even more rare.
<br><br>Therefore, no matter demon or human, those who become immortal, are able to go down in the history books of the Immortal River continent.
<br><br>Therefore, these three major demon beasts that dominate the Western Demon Forest and became immortal existed some time ago, so they instantly recognized them.
<br><br>But didn't they cross the barrier and go to the immortal world?
<br><br>How did they appear here?
<br><br>And with chains bolted to them?
<br><br>And as for the other big black bird, although they didn't recognize it, the pressure they felt from him seemed more powerful than the three demon immortals!
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>This kind of shocking mundane scene, what the hell is going on?
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at this group of frozen people, thought it was scared of them, so quickly smiled and explained: "You do not need to be afraid, this is a few wild things I caught from the mountains at random but, are tethered, can not hurt people."
<br><br>The moment these words fell.
<br><br>The crowd was once again dumbfounded.
<br><br>The randomly caught ......
<br><br>Wild things ？？？？
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>What kind of divine pussy is this pretending to be!
