Looking at the back of Yi Feng left, white floating attention for a long time.
<br><br>In those eyes, the sorrow for a long time.
<br><br>She never thought that her first invitation to the opposite sex would end in failure.
<br><br>This kind of feeling, is really not good ah!
<br><br>"But you, Mr. Yi ......" However, Bai Piao Piao suddenly revealed a smile and murmured, "You're really interesting!"
<br><br>Yi Feng disappeared from sight, Bai Piao Piao then turned around and walked into the guest room behind him, after all, Mao Mao is still resting, since she is here, it would be better to clean up the room directly.
<br><br>The room, cleaned up very clean.
<br><br>Even more than before Yi Feng lived, more clean.
<br><br>Especially the bedding, folded into a bean curd block shape, angular, which makes Bai Piao Piao eyes flash a strange color.
<br><br>"Yi Feng ah Yi Feng, obviously you are only a mortal, but you are such a mortal, but everywhere through the extraordinary ah!" White floating side eyes gazing at the clean bedding, attitude showing thoughtful murmuring: "gentle, elegant, extraordinary temperament, made the poetry is astounding, play the tune broke my bottleneck, even I this garden array open state, you still came ......"
<br><br>"You ...... are in the end what kind of person?" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Dazed for a long, long time, white floating only to hold up the bedding on the bed ready to change.
<br><br>But just hold up, her beautiful eyes moved slightly, and her soulful gaze looked at the quilt in her hands.
<br><br>It seems that the top.
<br><br>There is a good smell?
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao looked around and saw that no one was around, so her pretty nose lightly pushed over.
<br><br>The faint fragrance introduced into the nose, actually let her have a feeling of fascination.
<br><br>"Is this his smell?"
<br><br>The actual fact is that you can't be sure that you're going to be able to get a good deal on your own.
<br><br>And what is more incredible to her is that she actually has the impulse to hold this futon and lie down here to sleep.
<br><br>She clenched her teeth.
<br><br>The impulse was finally put into action and turned into a fact.
<br><br>After gently tripping down, covered with bedding, the faint fragrance from all sides diffused, Bai Piao Piao felt an unprecedented sense of comfort came, but gradually had a sense of sleep, the pair of beautiful eyes could not help but close, the body relaxed.
<br><br>Time, slowly passed.
<br><br>After a long, long time ......
<br><br>White Peopeo woke up, her body felt more comfortable than ever before, this sleep simply emptied her body of fatigue.
<br><br>She gently stretched out her hands from the bedding, grabbed the edge of the mattress, gently pulled it down to the tip of her nose, and could not help but smell it.
<br><br>But just in the middle of Bai Piao Piao's fascination, but found someone staring at her.
<br><br>He turned his head.
<br><br>Sure enough, there was a pair of incredibly big eyes stomping on her, as if she had been here for a long time, finally couldn't help but shout: "Ah, Miss, you actually ......"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's face changed slightly, her body moved then pulled away from the bedding and came to Mao Mao's body, her jade hand blocked Mao Mao's small mouth.
<br><br>"Miss you let go of me." Mao Mao directly broke away and pointed to the wooden bed next to him and continued to shout: "You actually slept in the bed that Yi Feng slept in ......"
<br><br>"I did not!"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao red face sophomoric, never thought that such an unspeakable thing was actually seen by others.
<br><br>"Still say no, just now I have seen."
<br><br>But Mao Mao still in the middle of incredulity, continued to shout, mouth covered can not be covered.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>White Piao Piao iron blue face, softly scolded: "You do not say."
<br><br>"No, I'm going to say, you just slept in Yi Feng's bed, I saw it all, you still sophomoric." Mao Mao said undyingly.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>White Piao Piao was Mao Mao said he wanted to find a crack in the ground, face a ruthless, into a palm into a knife slapped on the back of Mao Mao's neck.
<br><br>White eyes rolled over, Mao Mao directly fell to the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piao Piao just breathed a sigh of relief and sat down again.
<br><br>Touching his dry and hot face, he found that it was already red up to his neck, thinking back on this absurdity, he himself felt shy.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng was mindful of Zhong Qing's injuries and rushed towards the mountain without stopping.
<br><br>And the martial arts school, less Yi Feng the presence of the master, but also a few less lively, a few more cold.
<br><br>Ao Qing, the dog, was lying on the floor in boredom, yawning in his mouth.
<br><br>"Shh!"
<br><br>"Doggie, come here for me."
<br><br>Suddenly, a light whistle sounded, accompanied by a playful voice that reached its ears.
<br><br>Almost instantly, Ao Qing's body hair exploded, his heart bubbled up to his throat, lying on his back it jumped up directly, his limbs couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>Under the hairy bones, he was in a cold sweat, slowly looking toward the well cover behind him.
<br><br>"Skeleton, skeleton master, do you have anything to order?" Ao Qing stammered.
