Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>In the palace.
<br><br>Wu Tian was sitting at the top.
<br><br>Outside the palace hall, seven or eight women as beautiful as heavenly immortals walked in.
<br><br>"Greetings to the king of the country."
<br><br>After walking into the palace hall, the women wanted to give Wu Tian a kneeling bow.
<br><br>However, just as they bowed, a soft force lifted them up.
<br><br>"You have had intimate acts with my big brother and are considered half of my big brother's women, so you don't need to worship me and I can't afford this worship." Wu Tian said indifferently.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the king."
<br><br>The women hurriedly said thanks.
<br><br>"In addition, because of your good service, my big brother gave each of you a dust-sized bone chip to scrape as payment." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"You guys, take it and refine it well."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Wu Tian waved his palm and seven strands of light fell into the hands of the women.
<br><br>"Remember, make sure to refine it well, if you refine it successfully, the seven of you will be able to achieve the Supreme Bone and have a great future in the future!"
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>The women immediately showed a strong look of surprise.
<br><br>Supreme Bone.
<br><br>I never thought it would be the Supreme Bone.
<br><br>This was a legendary super physique.
<br><br>This kind of blessing simply made them not dare to imagine.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the kingdom ruler."
<br><br>Under the excitement, the seven women wanted to kneel down again.
<br><br>"As I said, you don't need to kneel to me, let alone thank me." Wu Tian exerted his power to gently lift up the seven and said indifferently, "If you want to thank, you have to thank my big brother."
<br><br>"So after you go back, you have to practice your songs and dances diligently, and the next time you have the chance to see my big brother again, you must make him happy and joyful, do you understand?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The seven women nodded respectfully, while carefully collecting the sliver of bone shavings.
<br><br>While the seven women received this blessing, the two people standing at the side had bitter smiles on their faces and their hearts were blue with remorse.
<br><br>Wu Tian seemed to notice their expressions and faintly inclined his head, his gaze slightly mocking.
<br><br>These two were the same two people who had their heads cut off on the city tower.
<br><br>He did not really kill them.
<br><br>Beheading is only a slight punishment, at that time to play the role of a chicken to make an example of monkeys.
<br><br>In addition, to a certain strength, beheaded will not see death, but will only lose a certain amount of power.
<br><br>"Originally I remembered that you are loyal to the empire, the first time to share such a good thing to you, but you do not cherish, not only disobedient to me, more excessive is to belittle Mr. and my big brother."
<br><br>"I think this bitter fruit, now you have also eaten."
<br><br>"In the future, be good to yourself!"
<br><br>The faint voice came out, making the hearts of the two people sour, kneeling on the ground with both knees, filled with remorse.
<br><br>Supreme Bone.
<br><br>But the Supreme Bone!
<br><br>Had I known that this trip had such a blessing, I would have let my daughter take the trip.
<br><br>But now it's too late to say anything.
<br><br>It can be expected that the daughters of several other ministers of the same dynasty will have unlimited achievements in the future, and even among the seven, some will be able to sit on the emperor's throne in the future.
<br><br>Their sons and daughters, even if originally excellent, but now compared, can only be considered mediocre to the extreme.
<br><br>The future of their lineage.
<br><br>The end will come!
<br><br>Both of them looked full of decadence, and aged many years at once.
<br><br>In the next few days, Wu Tian was dealing with the follow-up of the empire.
<br><br>Because he always did not forget Yi Feng's teaching.
<br><br>Higher eyesight.
<br><br>A higher pattern!
<br><br>"Number one in the world."
<br><br>"Yes, I want to be number one in the world."
<br><br>"To be, I want to be the emperor of the entire Lingxu Realm, the small Wu Tian Empire, what does it count?"
<br><br>"Just before resigning from this position, I should also do something more for the Wu Tian Empire."
<br><br>Wu Tian sat on the dragon chair armrests thinking.
<br><br>Decided that it was better to take down the position that was contested with the Wind Whispering Empire some time ago.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Only then can the Wu Tian Empire be solid as gold.
<br><br>Just wind language empire is not weak, want to take down, is not an easy task.
<br><br>"It looks like I have to get a favor from Sir."
<br><br>So, Wu Tian took out the voice transmission jade slip.
<br><br>But after thinking about it, it didn't seem right to bother Mister with such a small matter.
<br><br>"It's better to inform big brother!"
<br><br>The sound transmission jade brief lit up.
<br><br>Over there came Bone Ben Wei's voice.
<br><br>"Aigoo, Chicken Little, what do you want from your brother!"
<br><br>"Big brother, it's like this, Chicken Little wants to ask you a favor, come over and fart." Wu Tian told the matter of the position to Bone Ben Wei, hoping to get Bone Ben Wei's help.
<br><br>"Little chicken, no wonder the master said you have no pattern, just such a little thing also trouble me?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's lecturing voice came out.
<br><br>This made Wu Tian ashamed.
<br><br>"Forget it, I'll let your milkshake brother come over and sit on his butt, you wait, it will be ready soon ......"
<br><br>Subsequently, the conversation between Bones Ben Wei and Milk Dose came faintly from over there.
<br><br>Finished, skeleton Ben Wei only faintly said: "ready to send people is to take the ground!"
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>Wu Tian was excited.
<br><br>But before he could say thank you, he felt a huge commotion coming from the distance.
<br><br>With a long sweep, he arrived at the highest hill of the Imperial City.
<br><br>Staring with his eyes, he looked.
<br><br>Then he saw, in the distant sky, a shockingly large ass appeared, and then sat down heavily towards the ground.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The sky and the earth were shaken.
<br><br>Even the imperial city, which was thousands of miles away from each other, also came a burst of sound.
<br><br>Wu Tian stared and staggered.
<br><br>"Big brother, what a thunderbolt!"
<br><br>"What a terrifying ass!"
<br><br>While being silently grateful in his heart, Wu Tian quickly sent people into that position.
<br><br>After easily taking this place, Wu Tian finally finished the matter at hand.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>In just half a day's time, a piece of news spread throughout the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>The whole empire was in an uproar.
<br><br>The ruler of Wu Tian, himself, had abdicated.
<br><br>At the entrance of the Wu Tian Empire's Imperial City, two figures swept in, precisely the two people sent by the Cloud Top Empire to give the holy decree.
<br><br>"Finally, they arrived."
<br><br>"Yes, with the holy decree, Wu Tian does not dare to disobey."
<br><br>"Qi luck immortal pillar, and can rise a lot of fall."
<br><br>The two men looked at each other and smiled, and stepped into the imperial city with one foot.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>The first foot just entered the imperial city, the second foot coldly heard the news of Wu Tian's abdication.
<br><br>Two people.
<br><br>At once, they were dumbfounded!
