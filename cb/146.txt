"Mmm!"
<br><br>Yi Feng solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>Originally this person he did not want to stay, but remembered that the old man Wu a few old, picking dung this job is afraid that can not do, in case of falling into the dung pit drowned or a disaster.
<br><br>And this Lu Dasheng looks a lot younger, and just find the door, do not use it for nothing.
<br><br>At the words, Lu Dasheng gritted his teeth and nodded.
<br><br>Pick dung, just pick dung.
<br><br>What's the big deal.
<br><br>After all, those three martial arts clans just now, did not also do farm work?
<br><br>Besides, what's the big deal if you can get a holy treasure and pick a dung? I'm afraid that if word of this gets out, there will be countless experts fighting to pick the dung.
<br><br>So now that I think about it, this is still a rare opportunity!
<br><br>After thinking about it, Lu Dasheng no longer have resistance to picking dung, will look warmly at Yi Feng again and said, "Lord do not worry, picking dung I can." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Said, also did not forget to pat his bladder.
<br><br>"Okay, then it's you, thirty gold coins, pick the dung needed here, any comments?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"No opinion."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng quickly nodded, and how can he not see, this is into the mortal game of earth's big brother, go through the stage well, those three martial arts clan understand, how will he not understand it.
<br><br>"But, I ugly words also said in the front."
<br><br>Yi Feng eyes narrowed again, said: "Since you agreed to this thing, that will not pick the dung here, you will not be able to go, if you pick two days to run away, do not blame me not polite!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, I will finish picking, I will finish picking!" Lu Dasheng hurriedly nodded his head, said with a face full of expectation: "Then senior, hurry up and take things out, I'll start now!"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave him a look.
<br><br>Although this guy looks quite disagreeable, but the work is still quite reliable, seems to be very enthusiastic about picking dung ah!
<br><br>"Okay, come with me!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>At that, Lu Dasheng hurriedly followed towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>However, it was found that Yi Feng was not heading inside the store, so he asked, "Lord, this, shouldn't it be taken inside?"
<br><br>"It's not there, it's over here, just follow me." Yi Feng said indifferently, then with a puzzled Lu Dasheng walked next door to the home of Grand Master Wang, and after speaking with him, without saying a word, Grand Master Wang lent his pair of dung buckets and stretcher to Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>Looking at the pair of buckets, Lu Dasheng's eyes were about to stare out, pointing at it and stammering, "Da, Da Da Da people, just, just this?"
<br><br>"Otherwise, there is no dung bucket inside my house." Yi Feng said in a deep voice.
<br><br>At the sound of his voice, Lu Dasheng took two sharp steps backwards, and almost didn't catch his breath to draw over.
<br><br>Why.
<br><br>Why is not what he thought?
<br><br>Lu Dasheng felt a sour heart, full of aggression in the heart spread, tears almost flowed out again.
<br><br>"Big, my lord, can I stop doing this job?" Lu Dasheng asked cautiously.
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng face immediately a plate, cold gaze immediately looked at him, said in a deep voice: "You play me?"
<br><br>This glance, glared Lu Dasheng almost soul, shivered and then hurriedly waved his hands and said: "Senior, dare not dare, I will do it immediately."
<br><br>"Then why don't you go quickly?"
<br><br>"Today, give me to carry the dung in the cesspit of Grand Master Wang, if you can not finish, then you are finished!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sullenly drank, did not leave the slightest bit of mercy to Lu Dasheng, he can see, Lu Dasheng is a complete hobnail, this kind of hobnail you can not talk to him properly.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made Lu Dasheng shiver violently.
<br><br>Obviously, this one has been angry, even if the reluctance, he can only stifle the skin to do.
<br><br>But a look at the cesspit, Lu Dasheng tears finally fell out, almost did not pass out.
<br><br>This motherfucker.
<br><br>How long is not cleaned up, are about to pile up the fucking mountain.
<br><br>But full of unwillingness to use what use, the sharp start to work, after all, Yi Feng's words just echoed in his ears, he did not doubt that if he did not finish, the small life stay here.
<br><br>Moreover, he did not dare to use his cultivation, in case he bumped into this one again, he may not even have the chance to pick the dung.
<br><br>Picked up two buckets full of dung, Lu Dasheng flew up, behind him even brought up a gust of wind.
<br><br>While running, tears flowed down indisputably.
<br><br>The two storage rings are lost, he titled the first pill refiner in Nansha, but also picked up the dung, the damn word out how to live ah!
