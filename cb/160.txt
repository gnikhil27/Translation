"Ao Zhong, I really don't know how you have the face to say such things."
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang said with a gloomy face, "Qingcheng got my Red Sun lineage inheritance, she obviously knew that breaking her body before the Demon Sect would lead to the loss of her previous work, would she do such a foolish thing?"
<br><br>"And she is the first of the young generation, whether it is strength, appearance, or talent are outstanding, countless young talent in the clan she does not put in the eyes, and how will look at that waste son of yours?"
<br><br>"Humph, that's hard to say."
<br><br>"Although my son Qing's strength and talent are only average, but with my genetic heritage, his looks are beyond words." Ao Zhong said without blushing in the slightest, "In case your family Ao Qingcheng falls under my family Qing'er's stunning beauty, that's not necessarily impossible."
<br><br>"You, you you ......"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's body trembled with anger, pointing at Ao Zhong and said in a cold voice: "So, you are trying to pass this matter off as ambiguous?"
<br><br>"Otherwise, although I don't see your Red Sun Clan in a good light, but at least it is also the mainstay of our Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan, I can't just hold on to this matter, right?" Ao Zhong sighed and waved his hand: "So, this matter my family Qing'er although quite a loss, but for the sake of my tribe unity, I can only so choose not to pursue."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Pfft ......"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang in Ao Zhong after this sentence, finally was not able to hold back, a tight chest, a mouthful of fresh blood gushed straight up. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Well, well, everything you Devouring Heavenly Emperor has inflicted on my Red Sun lineage today, I remember!"
<br><br>Forcing the blood down, his gloomy eyes stared straight at Ao Zhong, and a voice of hatred came out.
<br><br>Although he was tempted to strike directly, but if he really did, he would definitely be caught by Ao Zhong and instead put a charge of subordination on their Red Sun Lineage.
<br><br>This is extremely detrimental to their overall situation.
<br><br>He could only swallow the anger that filled his heart, gave Ao Zhong a gloomy look, and left with the crowd's faces resigned.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Looking at Ao Bi Fang's woefully departed figure, Ao Zhong let out a loud laugh, emitting a smug sound.
<br><br>"It's really unexpected, this most untalented son of mine has actually done something that makes even me, Ao Zhong, admire."
<br><br>"Give Ao Qingcheng to ...... cool ah!"
<br><br>"This time, directly broke the Red Sun lineage's as intended, let their treacherous plan directly not break, really my royal lineage's merit ah!"
<br><br>With unbridled laughter, he hurried back towards the Heaven Devouring Hall.
<br><br>Just a few steps away, he saw a youth walking with two enchanting wolf clan women in his arms, his second son Ao Tie.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Zhong's face instantly became gloomy.
<br><br>"Father!"
<br><br>Seeing Ao Zhong, Ao Tie hurriedly saluted respectfully.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Waste."
<br><br>Ao Zhong glanced at the two Wolf Clan women beside Ao Tie and shouted.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Ao Tie immediately showed a look of aggression and said slightly reluctantly, "Father, why are you saying this? Although my son is not as good as that Ao Qingcheng, he is still the most outstanding among your three sons, right?"
<br><br>"The most outstanding, you are also worthy?"
<br><br>Ao Zhong said nonchalantly, "You'd better learn more from your brother!"
<br><br>"My brother?"
<br><br>"Ao Qing?"
<br><br>Ao Tie looked at Ao Zhong and said uncomfortably, "Father, there seems to be nothing for me to learn from Ao Qing, whether it's talent, cultivation, or power and strategy, I, as a brother, am a hundred thousand miles behind him, and he's a waste who was expelled from the family, how can he be qualified to compare with me?"
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>Ao Zhong was so angry that he slapped Ao Tie's face and scolded, "If your brother is a waste, then you are worse than a waste, if you want to compare with him, you should first get Ao Qingcheng, instead of spending all your time on these rouges!"
<br><br>Receiving a slap, Ao Tie's face became even more resentful, just about to retort back, but just heard Ao Tie's words.
<br><br>The whole person trembled violently and stared with eyes showing an incredible look.
<br><br>"Father you are saying that Ao Qing gave Ao Qingcheng?"
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>This news shocked Ao Tie for a long time, staring, his eyes almost fell down.
