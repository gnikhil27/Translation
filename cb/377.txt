Of course.
<br><br>He could not really promise a woman, after all, this high monk even incense temples do not see, and how will be because of a woman and how it is.
<br><br>Subsequently.
<br><br>Yi Feng promised a lot of tempting conditions, but this monk is still unmoved.
<br><br>Yi Feng finally gave up.
<br><br>Perhaps, this is the real high monk!
<br><br>Running around in the world, but not by the world to be tied up, all the things outside the body and mortal trifles, are not in his eyes.
<br><br>That's all.
<br><br>This kind of out of the mud and not dyed high monk, Yi Feng is also considered completely not to play him that mind.
<br><br>If forced to ask, will not it add to the sins?

<br><br>Yi Feng led monk Kunpeng to the island's cafeteria, the cafeteria there are still some leftover food.
<br><br>Then Yi Feng told Kun Peng to sit down and asked someone to serve a plain fasting meal.
<br><br>"Many thanks, monk."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng said with a smile.
<br><br>"It's okay, eat."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said casually.
<br><br>"Actually, the place of the monk is still good, it's just that I ......"
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng glanced at the meal in his hand and explained softly, "Indeed there is no motivation for me to stay."
<br><br>"Don't say it, don't say it, can understand."
<br><br>Yi Feng said without minding.
<br><br>Afterwards he also thought about it, he just promised, some on the head, what temple big Buddha really established, how many gold coins have to spend ah?
<br><br>It's a good thing that monk Kunpeng did not promise himself, otherwise he would have to regret his intestines.
<br><br>Recruit a disciple are so, that a hundred disciples down, then he Yi Feng is completely no play.
<br><br>A few moments later, monk Kunpeng got up.
<br><br>"Master, poor monk first farewell."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng folded his hands and said in a gentle voice.
<br><br>"Take your time."
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and prepared to see him off.
<br><br>"Stay here, monk, I will leave on my own." Monk Kunpeng said softly.
<br><br>"All right, then I won't see you off, you can leave by yourself, there is a boat when you get to the shore." Yi Feng also did not polite, said softly.
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng nodded at Yi Feng, then got up and left.
<br><br>"This monk ......"
<br><br>"Just now said hungry, fasting rice but did not eat a bite, really strange." Yi Feng took a look at the bowls and chopsticks that Kun Peng put down and couldn't help but spit out a sentence.
<br><br>But he did not put it on his mind, but continued to wander around the island, continuing to look for the money bag lost two days ago.
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng's pace was light, and his face always carried a faint gentle smile.
<br><br>Soft gaze faintly glanced around, saw no one around, palm slowly fell into the waist.
<br><br>De.
<br><br>A chicken leg was drawn out.
<br><br>"Luckily it went along with a chicken leg."
<br><br>Kun Peng monk lightly murmured a sentence, full of greasy mouth gnawed up.
<br><br>A few moments later.
<br><br>He finished gnawing on the chicken leg.
<br><br>After throwing away the chicken bones, he swept his gaze in all directions again.
<br><br>Many people fell into his observation.
<br><br>Only, the first time he looked, he landed on Chen Da Ma's body.
<br><br>Alas ......
<br><br>He shook up his head.

<br><br>Then, the gaze fell on a few other few women on the island, could not help but shake his head.
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha."
<br><br>"Goodness is good."
<br><br>"I thought there would be some evil things here that would be able to put me on the spot, it seems that after all I thought too much ah, here can not stay, can not stay ......"
<br><br>With a sigh, he took a step away.
<br><br>Just two steps away, the body suddenly a meal.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>He opened his eyes wide in surprise and looked at Zhong Qing, who was sitting frozen under the tree in front of him.
<br><br>"Phew."
<br><br>"Master this is really a divine book!"
<br><br>"This posture if it is with the Dreaming Sky ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's mind is completely in the hands of the picture book book, rose red little face, from time to time angled head aspiring, and from time to time looked down at the pants.
<br><br>Unbeknownst to him, there was a monk behind him, staring at his books and looking at them with fascination.
<br><br>"Good stuff, good stuff!"
<br><br>"I never thought there would be something so good in this world, especially this one, it's simply a sight to behold, I can't help but try it."
<br><br>Taking in the picture on that page, Monk Kun Peng was greatly excited.
<br><br>Then, a majestic voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"Master, at your young age, how could you look at such harmful things?" He said with a great face.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was startled.
<br><br>He stood up in a panic and looked back at Monk Kunpeng who appeared at some point.
