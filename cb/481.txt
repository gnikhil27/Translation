At the Heaven and Earth Sect's mountain gate.
<br><br>Under Su Yun Yun's gathering, there were already several disciples gathered.
<br><br>There was Li Jin who was holding a long sword and had a righteous aura.
<br><br>There was Bai Qiyu who had an open head and a cloak on his shoulders.
<br><br>"Senior brother Xiao Zhan has gone back first, let's set off when the eighteenth senior brother arrives!" Su Yun Yun instructed.
<br><br>"What, eighteenth senior brother?"
<br><br>"Fifth senior sister, you also called the eighteenth senior brother?" Li Jin asked with a gruff frown.
<br><br>"Of course, we are one heart as master brothers."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun nodded solemnly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Li Jin's forehead instantly flowed with cold sweat. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Fifth senior sister, I think there is no need for it, right?" Li Jin's voice shivered and said, "Eighteenth senior brother fighting is too scary, ruthless up even their own people, but also move to a self-destruction."
<br><br>Hearing this.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun frowned.
<br><br>Seems to be also remembered what, body can not help but tremble, shivered.
<br><br>This eighteenth senior brother of hers was indeed like that.
<br><br>No one can pull it off when he goes crazy, even she, as a senior sister, can't do anything about it.
<br><br>So she is also guilty of muttering, whether or not to call the old eighteen?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before she had time to make a decision, a guy with bandages all over his body suddenly appeared in the distance.
<br><br>It was Hong Crazy, who was ranked eighteenth.
<br><br>He walked all the way here, craning his neck as he did so, with a smile full of evil on his face.
<br><br>"I heard that there is a fight again."
<br><br>"I just don't know if there are many enemies this time."
<br><br>"If there are enough people, it would be good to have a self-explosion in the center, that mutilated legs, corpses everywhere, is certainly a visual feast."
<br><br>"This act full of art, it's really something to look forward to."
<br><br>He raised the corner of his mouth, and a sultry voice came out.
<br><br>Once Hong Crazy's words fell, the surrounding crowd collectively shivered.
<br><br>A good deal of pacification, Hong crazy repeatedly assured not to blow themselves up after, the crowd is ready to feel at ease on the road.
<br><br>And the destination, is in the Lingxu realm.
<br><br>At this moment Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>Cang Dao Empire, within the Heavenly Star City.
<br><br>In a luxurious restaurant.
<br><br>It was filled with people, all dignitaries inside and outside of the Heavenly Star City.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>These people were at this moment respectfully toasting towards the two people at the main seat, their expressions full of humility.
<br><br>The main seat.
<br><br>It was a delicate woman with a frosty face, facing these people's toasts, she didn't pay attention to them, and was only casually handled by an old man next to her.
<br><br>And her gaze only intentionally or unintentionally surveyed, the silent Xiao Yun, the head of the Xiao family at the table.
<br><br>Noticing the woman's gaze, Xiao Yun tightly frowned.
<br><br>The woman in front of him was named Liu Nan Yan and came from the Liu family in the next city.
<br><br>For hundreds of years, the Liu family had been supported by the Xiao family, so the Liu family was flourishing, so twenty years ago, the Liu family's predecessor, in return for his kindness, betrothed Liu Nanyan to his son Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>But today's Liu Ruyan is not what it used to be, detecting top talent and becoming the meat and potatoes of all the sects in the entire Cang Dao Empire in one fell swoop, and was finally brought into the mountain by the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>And under the careful cultivation of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, Liu Ruyan did not disappoint, breaking through to the Human Immortal realm in just three years.
<br><br>Human Immortal.
<br><br>It may not be much in the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>But she is only twenty years old today.
<br><br>At the age of twenty, the future achievements of the Human Immortal are unlimited, so she has become the Saintess of the Heavenly Spirit Sect and is being trained as the next successor.
<br><br>This identity is very golden.
<br><br>If the Xiao family is barely considered one of the overlords of the Heavenly Star City, the Heavenly Spirit Sect is the overlord of the entire southern domain, and even has a notable relationship with the imperial headquarters.
<br><br>The two forces can be said to be worlds apart.
<br><br>Therefore, under this heavenly difference, a few days ago, Liu Nanyan came to the Xiao family with the elders of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>They directly expressed their intention to withdraw from the marriage.
<br><br>Although the withdrawal of marriage is a great shame in the Lingxu Realm, and even his Xiao family will be nailed to the pillar of shame because of it, but Xiao Yun also understands in his heart, what is the status of Liu Nanyan today, and what is the status of his son?
<br><br>It is not the same as before!
<br><br>Therefore, Xiao Yun's heart does not want to climb this olive branch.
<br><br>But his son's life has been difficult, before originally had a talent not much worse than Liu Nanyan, but unfortunately the fate of heaven is not fair, suffered a change all cultivation lost, and now suffered a withdrawal of marriage, how can he suffer this blow?
<br><br>So Xiao Yun did not agree to Liu Nanyan's request at first, saying that he would wait until Xiao Zhan, who had gone out to the Immortal River for training, returned before making a decision.
<br><br>He, the father, was useless to let his son suffer this, so in his opinion, it was fine to withdraw from the marriage, but he also had to personally obtain his son's consent.
<br><br>In this way.
<br><br>It is also considered to give his son, who has a difficult fate, some more decency.
<br><br>It was the only thing he could do as a father.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that today Liu Nanyan inexplicably set up a bureau and invited the other families of Tianxing City to be his guests.
<br><br>Xiao Yun always felt that it was not simple.
<br><br>This thing.
<br><br>He always felt that it was coming for his Xiao family.
<br><br>After all, whether it was the Heavenly Spirit Sect or Liu Ruyan, there was absolutely no need to invite these people.
<br><br>"Okay, all stop drinking."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan glanced at the various toasts, a trace of impatience appeared in her eyes, and drank in a deep voice.
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>The crowd that was just boisterous suddenly silenced, apprehensively sat down, the field was filled with silence.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan glanced at the old man next to her.
<br><br>The old man nodded and dropped his gaze onto Xiao Yun.
<br><br>"Master of the Xiao family, how is the matter of the Saint Maiden's withdrawal from the marriage with your son being considered?" The old man asked.
<br><br>Xiao Yun frowned, his forehead veins exposed, and the cup held in his hand exploded.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Sure enough, they were coming for his Xiao family.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Withdrawal of marriage?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the other powers of the Heavenly Star City instantly turned their bizarre gazes towards Xiao Yun, instantly revealing a look of mockery.
<br><br>Humph.
<br><br>Having been withdrawn from the marriage, I want to see what face your Xiao Family will have in Tian Xing City in the future.
<br><br>I thought that your Xiao family relied on this relationship with the Liu family, has not dared to move you, it turns out that only by the Liu family abandoned the existence of well.
<br><br>The crowd sneered and laughed.
<br><br>Looking around these burning eyes, Xiao Yun fists clenched crunching, anger attack, a mouthful of fresh blood gushed out, but he swallowed hard.
<br><br>He did not just want to wait until Xiao Zhan came back, never said he was not willing to withdraw from the marriage.
<br><br>But Liu Ruyan used other forces to coerce.
<br><br>It was really ruthless!
<br><br>"Father, are you all right?"
<br><br>And at this moment, a young man rushed in with an anxious expression and hurriedly held Xiao Yun, it was Xiao Zhan who had rushed back from the Heaven and Earth Gate.
