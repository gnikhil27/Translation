Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>Demon Ling'er closed her eyes to cultivate, but always had a hard time getting her mind at ease, always felt that something was going to happen.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she came to Ning Xuanwu and said respectfully, "Master, I always feel that we are a little hasty this time."
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu, who had closed his eyes to cultivate, opened his eyes and looked at Demon Spirituality.
<br><br>"If you have anything to say, just say it!"
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er frowned and said, "Previously, our guess was that the high person in Pingjiang City was a blindfold put out by the Castle Peak Sect, so we directly sent Senior Brother Wuduan and the two of them to investigate."
<br><br>"But Senior Brother Wuduan and the two have always been straightforward, with their character it is likely that they will directly kill the door."
<br><br>"If that high person is really as we guessed that is a barrier, this is nothing, but if ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Demon Ling'er's gaze looked towards Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>Sure enough. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's eyes fiercely picked.
<br><br>Also immediately understood the seriousness of the matter, if what that Yu Wujie said is true, not a blindfold of the Castle Peak Gate, then the dustless and heartless kill the door ......
<br><br>Imagine, can create that kind of divine weapons, is not what ordinary people, alone with the net dustless and net heartless two, and will not be the opponent.
<br><br>"So master, I think it's better for my apprentice to personally go down to the mountain to poke around!" Demon Ling'er said softly.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu waved his hand, after Demon Spirit'er left, he wanted to continue to settle down and cultivate, but remembering what Demon Spirit said, he also became faint-hearted and hard to be at peace.
<br><br>Taking advantage of the night, at dawn, Demon Spiritual had rushed back to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>She did not act in the same way as the two Pure Dustless, but came directly to the restaurant and grabbed a random person to inquire about the news.
<br><br>Recently, in addition to the few small martial arts schools left in Pingjiang City, all other martial arts schools were slaughtered and empty.
<br><br>A little thought, demon Ling'er will know that the problem lies in these small martial arts schools, but only a few small martial arts schools, with her skills to investigate, it is easy.
<br><br>And Yi Feng also took Zhong Qing outside for a whole night, the next day when the sun was high, two people leisurely back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Wangcai, Wangcai, I brought you some delicious food."
<br><br>Yi Feng took out a package and threw it to Ao Qing, who ran over owlishly, but did not think about eating, but about what way to report yesterday's events to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing Ao Qing seemed to have little interest in food, Yi Feng was a little surprised at first, but soon found the answer.
<br><br>At the door, there was a snow-white bone!
<br><br>It must have been stolen by this dog from somewhere, just look at the meat on it all gnawed cleanly.
<br><br>In addition, Yi Feng also found a rag on the floor of the front hall, it is estimated that the dog also took back from which lump.
<br><br>Alas!
<br><br>Yi Feng did not blame, in his previous life he had two ha know, this is nothing, did not tear down his home this Wang Cai is quite obedient.
<br><br>"Come on, take this bone away!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand towards Ao Qing and instructed.
<br><br>Ao Qing's expression was stagnant.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's appearance, it seems to be very unimpressed with this bone.
<br><br>It shouldn't be ......
<br><br>How to say that also was beaten to the door, at least some reaction, right?
<br><br>Could it be that he already knew what happened yesterday?
<br><br>Once you think of this, Ao Qing then full of deep meaning looked at Yi Feng, he found that the more contact with this person, the more elusive ah!
<br><br>At the same time, he also remembered that he could see that scene yesterday, was it deliberately arranged by the senior?
<br><br>He did not forget Yi Feng before leaving the door, deliberately explained to him.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Ao Qing thought carefully, a surge of fear, if this is really the case, that means it is this senior to his knock ah.
<br><br>If you do not listen, it is likely to be the end of this ah.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he hastily picked up the bones with his mouth and prepared to dispose of them.
<br><br>Seeing this dog quite obedient, Yi Feng nodded, casually picked up the rag on the ground and shouted towards Zhong Qing: "Disciple ah, the house has not been cleaned for a long time, just take this rag to wipe the house everywhere, the pillars outside the door ah, the plaque ah do not leak."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing respectfully did as he was told.
<br><br>And at the same time, an enchanting figure, landed at the door of the martial arts school, and all of this fell into the eyes.
