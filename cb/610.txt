"Penis."
<br><br>"Ahhh!"
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>Seeing Li Di fall to the ground and become silent, Li Tian stared in anger, tearing his heart and shouting out.
<br><br>A pair of eyes hung with blood, will be full of resentment of the gaze dead on the white robed youth in front of the white robed youth, frenzy like rushed forward.
<br><br>"Bastard."
<br><br>"You animal, I will fight with you."
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>Li Tian's punch was lightly received by the white-robed youth.
<br><br>"Waste thing, you are also worthy to fight with me?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth uttered a morose cold voice, and a heavy kick interspersed with immortal energy landed abruptly on Li Tian's chest. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>Li Tian flew backwards in response to the sound.
<br><br>He hit the ground heavily, and his chest, moreover, collapsed a large piece, lying on the ground trying to get up, but could not get up.
<br><br>Under the violent coughing, even the fragments of internal organs that were shattered also vomited out.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Looking at Li Tian who could only stare at him with hatred but crawled on the ground like a dead dog struggling not to get up, the white-robed youth emitted a mocking laugh.
<br><br>While the old man behind him did not say a word, coldly watching the scene.
<br><br>"How about it, you know what happens when you cheat me?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth came in a condescending manner, walked up to the ruined Li Ren, and his palm gently landed on Li Ren's palm.
<br><br>Then he stepped down fiercely.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Li Ren, who was lying on the ground, immediately let out a heartbreaking scream, and his palm was directly sunk into the ground by this foot, turning into a bloody flesh.
<br><br>"You, you you you ......"
<br><br>Li Tian was like a ferocious beast staring at the white-robed youth with a deadly stare, exhaling sharply and saying fiercely, "You dare to do this to our brothers, the Skeleton Grand Master and the others will not spare you!"
<br><br>"Skeleton Master?"
<br><br>"Hahaha?"
<br><br>"I don't know where the trash thing came from, never even heard of it, and also worthy of being called a grand master?"
<br><br>"Let alone that he is not here, even if he is here, if he doesn't give me the top-tier immortal weapon, that what's-her-name Skeleton Grand Master will end up no different from you bunch of trash."
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>The white-robed youth sneered out, staring at Li Tian, who was lying on the ground, in a condescending manner.
<br><br>"Originally, if you obediently presented your immortal weapons, this lord would not have made things difficult for you."
<br><br>"But you guys just want to deceive me."
<br><br>"This lord is most tired of people deceiving me, and even more so, he will not allow anyone to disobey me."
<br><br>"So you all only deserve to end up like this."
<br><br>"But this lord is not willing to drive all of you to death, so I'll give you one last chance to bring up the top-tier immortal weapon yourself."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>He lightly stretched out his palm.
<br><br>"I won't give it to you even if I die!"
<br><br>Li Tian spat out a mouthful of blood foam and said in a deep voice, "You kill me."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"I can't see that you're still a hard-headed person!"
<br><br>"Then I will not kill you."
<br><br>"Instead, kill him!"
<br><br>Saying that, the white-robed youth dropped his gaze to the dying Li Ren, and with a slight shift of his foot, he stepped on his head.
<br><br>"Stop!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Tian glared, and hissed out, "I'll give it to you, don't kill him."
<br><br>"Whoa?"
<br><br>"Changed your mind?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth teased.
<br><br>"I'll give it to you I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you right away, please let him go."
<br><br>Li Tian left blood tears, almost with a supplicating voice, opened his storage ring with trembling hands, and then took out the top-grade immortal weapon inside the ring.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The white-robed youth's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>Even though he had known that this was a top-tier immortal weapon, he still couldn't help but feel excited when he saw it at this moment.
<br><br>Quickly, he picked it up and took it into his hand.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>"That's decent!"
<br><br>"I can spare your life."
<br><br>The white-robed youth raised the corner of his mouth, while viewing and measuring the top-grade immortal weapon in his hand, he said leisurely, "But the punishment for you cursing me just now, still has to be there, so he, still has to die."
<br><br>Saying that, the palm of his foot stepped down.
<br><br>Li's head, exploded with a bang.
<br><br>"Ah, you ......"
<br><br>"You, you beast, you don't keep your word, I'll fight you."
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>Li Tian's hissing voice spread across the sky, red eyes hated the blood and flesh of this person in front of him, and did not know where to burst out of the strength, rose from the ground and lunged towards the white-robed youth.
<br><br>"Humph, waste."
<br><br>Faced with Li Tian's attack, the white-robed youth just lightly kicked Li Tian and sent him flying.
<br><br>At the same time this kick directly abolished Li Tian's dantian.
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"Elder Luo, let's go, I want to immediately refine this top-tier immortal weapon and recognize it as my master."
<br><br>In a burst of rampant laughter from the white-robed youth, he and the old man disappeared into thin air.
<br><br>"Ahhh ......"
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>The surviving Li Tian hung his feet and stretched his chest, looking at the old two and three who had long since lost their breath, and looked up to the sky and whistled.
<br><br>Hate.
<br><br>So hateful!
<br><br>Blood-stained palms, pinched inside the mud, dragging his heavily injured body, crawling towards Li Di's corpse.
<br><br>With difficulty, from Li Di's body, pulled out a piece of sound transmission jade slip.
<br><br>"Skeleton Grand Master, Skeleton Grand Master."
<br><br>His lips trembled and his mouth kept chanting as he tried to contact Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Aiya, these little pussies are too boring."
<br><br>"Come on, Qing ah, let's brothers continue to get high!"
<br><br>"Xiao Lingzi ah, the atmosphere, the atmosphere whole up ah."
<br><br>"Milk agent, with your round body, twist up ......"
<br><br>The Qingtian White Jade House in the box, the brothers continue to sing and dance in the vigorous.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>The jade brief lit up.
<br><br>Open it and take a look.
<br><br>"Skeleton, Skeleton Master, please, please, help us, help us take revenge ......"
<br><br>Weak voice, intermittently came ......
<br><br>It was Li Tian.
<br><br>Once this voice fell on Bones Ben Wei's ears, the originally noisy box, suddenly silent.
<br><br>And originally cheerful, he suddenly revealed a stream of shrewdness.
<br><br>Everything in the world, in his mind quickly filtered ......
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>An unprecedented aura burst out.
<br><br>"Bang Bang Bang Bang ......"
<br><br>Everything in the box, in this moment, instantly turned into powder.
<br><br>The entire Immortal Realm, at this moment the wind rose and clouds, lightning and thunder.
<br><br>Countless powerful people in the Immortal Realm felt an invisible heart palpitation in an invisible way.
<br><br>This feeling.
<br><br>It was as if the sky was falling down.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Angry!
<br><br>"When did someone dare to move even this slag's little brother?"
<br><br>It's too late, can't hold on, one short, come tomorrow.
