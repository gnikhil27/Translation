At this moment, the disciples of Star Peak were losing every day.
<br><br>Within a short period of time, one third of them had been lost.
<br><br>Yang Yi's pupils lying on the ground were already covered with blood.
<br><br>What made him even more desperate was that this Qi Tian didn't know what kind of demonic technique he had cultivated, and in a short period of time, he had actually raised his strength to a Third Turn Xuan Xian.
<br><br>"Kill me!"
<br><br>Yang Yi stared in death, hissing towards the slowly walking Qi Tian.
<br><br>Qi Tian raised the corner of his mouth, his face showing a bloodthirsty look.
<br><br>With a palm, it fell towards Yang Yi's heavenly spirit cover.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the nick of time, Qi Tian's movements suddenly stopped, hovering less than a finger above Yang Yi's head and stopped.
<br><br>Yang Yi looked at this scene in a daze. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Full of incredulity.
<br><br>And the same scene was staged in various parts of the surrounding battlefield.
<br><br>A disciple of Sun Moon Peak, knife are cut to the neck of a disciple of Star Peak, is also hard to stop ......
<br><br>A disciple of Sun Moon Peak who was sneaking attacking a disciple of Star Peak was just strangely fixed in mid-air ......
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>The Star Peak disciples stared at each other, filled with incredulity at what was happening in front of them.
<br><br>Just at this moment.
<br><br>They were surprised to find that that senior disciple Yi Feng, who had been sitting on the ground in a coiled position, had stood up at some point.
<br><br>He slowly walked by.
<br><br>And where he walked by, the bodies of the Sun Moon Peak's disciples fell one by one.
<br><br>The crowd.
<br><br>Qi Tian, who had lost his mobility, stared deadly at Yi Feng who had woken up, his eyes filled with trepidation and resignation.
<br><br>For, why?
<br><br>He was an old monster of the Star Immortal realm, who had easily taken over a contented body with his soul, and was about to rise again, how could such a thing happen?
<br><br>He is now a Triple Arcane Immortal ah.
<br><br>Even the three brothers of the Heavenly Mansion are just trash in front of him.
<br><br>But why, this Star Peak disciple in front of him.
<br><br>What kind of person was he?
<br><br>He had countless doubts.
<br><br>But he couldn't open his mouth at all.
<br><br>When Yi Feng approached him, he felt his vitality collapsing, even his soul.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>All the disciples of Sun Moon Peak fell down.
<br><br>Not a single one was left.
<br><br>The disciples of Star Peak had long been scared silly and stood still, looking at Yi Feng in fear.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood there quietly.
<br><br>Slowly lifted his palm.
<br><br>This is the strength of the fifty level upgrade?
<br><br>Putting his hand down, he inclined his head to look at Yang Yi and slowly walked over.
<br><br>"Yi, senior brother Yi Feng, you, you you ......"
<br><br>Yang Yi can no longer speak, emitting a stammering voice, looking at Yi Feng with trepidation as he walked.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not answer, but picked him up gently.
<br><br>After lifting up, only then said softly: "Let's go out!"
<br><br>Yang Yi nodded his head in a dull manner, his throat was like clicking with fish spines, unable to speak for a long time.
<br><br>"Ah ah, brother yeah, late, late, the opportunity to perform the wood la!"
<br><br>"The hell knows there are formations inside, uh we are not trapped in the formation can not get out of it!"
<br><br>"Okay, okay, don't shout, go, quickly see what else can help Yi Da master in doing not."
<br><br>Distant sky.
<br><br>Three silhouettes accompanied by the sound of shouting and cursing, fast flying.
<br><br>"It's the three from the Sun and Moon Peak Heavenly Mansion Kingdom!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yang Yi's face sank.
<br><br>The other disciples also instantly revealed their vigilance and took a stance to answer the battle.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The three who were thought to be looking for trouble made the Star Peak disciples fall to their faces.
<br><br>When they landed, they knelt to the ground and knocked on the ground without saying a word.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at them.
<br><br>Ignored them, but slowly walked towards the outer door.
<br><br>For him.
<br><br>This big competition, there is no longer meaningful, and the same goes for the three brothers of the Heavenly Mansion.
<br><br>Star Peak disciples, quietly followed behind him.
<br><br>The Xuantian Sect's large martial arts arena.
<br><br>At this moment, it is bustling with activity.
<br><br>Already the disciples of the entire sect had gathered.
<br><br>Because from just now, the martial arts arena presented the list of the big competition, there are a large number of Star Peak disciples died.
<br><br>This caused Liu Yan's eyes to be covered with blood.
<br><br>The other elders of Star Peak also became anxious and shouted towards the inner sect elders at the top, "Make sure to ask the elders to open the barrier and enter the grand competition site to see what happened."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The presiding elder showed a hesitant look on his face.
<br><br>It was indeed a rare occurrence for so many disciples to die in a short period of time.
<br><br>He was hesitating whether to send someone in to take a look when a voice came from Sun and Moon Peak Hundred Views.
<br><br>"Elder, this is a sect competition, there are deaths and injuries is normal, how can it be a child's play, if you really send people in, the fairness of this competition can not be guaranteed, this competition will also be a virtual nullity." Bajing shouted.
<br><br>"Bai Jing you fart."
<br><br>The Star Peak elders jumped up and cursed, "You murderous bastard, once you see the death of our Star Peak disciples, it has nothing to do with your Sun and Moon Peak."
<br><br>"Bullshit, no one died in Sun Moon Peak?"
<br><br>Bai Jing loudly dislike, "the hell knows what danger they encountered in there, only my Sun Moon Peak is far less than your Star Peak waste, death and injury is also within the limit."
<br><br>"Bai Jing, you don't stand and speak without pain." Liu Yan said with a cold face: "If so many people died in your Sun Moon Peak, can you still be calm?"
<br><br>"Peak Master Liu, why do you have to be like that." Bai Jing raised the corners of his mouth and said, "The path of cultivation is to fight with the sky, whether it is a big competition, training, there are risks, life and death have a life."
<br><br>"So can not sink also have to sink ah!"
<br><br>"You are talking lightly, I really hope that one day the same thing happened to your Sun Moon Peak, you can still be so light!" Liu Yan spoke out coldly.
<br><br>"Lord Liu, you also have a peak master, you should at least have the temperament of a peak master, our Sun Moon Peak will not be the same as you, even if all our Sun Moon Peak disciples die, will not be the same as you, shamelessly screaming endlessly!"
<br><br>Bai Jing coldly mocked.
<br><br>Recently, the master was angry enough by this group of people in Star Peak, and now he could not easily catch the pain point of Star Peak, so how could he not step on it properly?
<br><br>But his words just fell.
<br><br>The already lively martial arts arena suddenly became even more agitated.
<br><br>This time, the agitation was ten times more enthusiastic than before.
<br><br>"What's wrong again?"
<br><br>"It can't be that another person died in your Star Peak, right?"
<br><br>Hundred Jing looked at the list overhead like a joke and cast his gaze.
<br><br>But this glance.
<br><br>It made him sit on his butt.
