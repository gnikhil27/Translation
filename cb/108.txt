Two streams of light cut out, the two demons then returned to the water cave outside the house.
<br><br>"The water spirit grass is ripe, it can't be affected in any way, you and I will collect our demon aura and enter the house with me in my original form!"
<br><br>Bo Gu majestically ordered towards the centipede: "During the time I absorb the water spirit grass, you will be on the side to protect me, when I come out then go together to find that damn human, if you can't find him, all the humans in this mountain see one to kill one, all of them to refine me into a human stick!"
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Bo Gu."
<br><br>The centipede respectfully answered.
<br><br>With a flash of light, the two demons returned to their bodies, transforming into a turtle and a centipede to crawl towards the cave.
<br><br>"You slow down, this emperor is still behind!" While crawling, while looking at the centipede climbing quickly in front of him, Bo Gu suddenly emitted a voice of dissatisfaction.
<br><br>"Yes yes yes Lord Demon Emperor ......"
<br><br>Looking at Bogu's slow movements, the centipede smashed its lips and only had to follow Bogu's slow crawl, but dared not speak in anger.
<br><br>"Picking this water spirit grass really delayed me a lot of time!" Yi Feng carefully put the freshly picked water spirit grass into the bamboo basket, wiped the sweat and showed a satisfied look.
<br><br>And at the same time, Bo Gu and Centipede finally climbed in and happened to see this scene.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>"What kind of person dares to be so bold as to come to my cave and steal my Water Spirit Grass?"
<br><br>Bo Gu immediately stared at the scene with wide eyes, the whole was frozen in place.
<br><br>You know, as the cave of his demon emperor, ordinary small demons and monsters would go around, let alone enter his cave to steal something.
<br><br>Never thought that someone would dare to be so bold.
<br><br>"De..., demon..., demon emperor, he, he is the human who stole the Heavenly Heart Tantalum." And the centipede also froze, wiping his eyes with his forefeet, and immediately sent a panicked voice towards the demon emperor.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Bo Gu's eyes widened, and then a monstrous anger exploded out of his body.
<br><br>He was looking for this damned human everywhere, but he didn't expect this miscreant to come straight to his lair and take his newly ripened water spirit grass into his pocket.
<br><br>Unforgivable!
<br><br>Simply unforgivable ......
<br><br>"Death!"
<br><br>The sky rage erupted, the thick demon power in the body crazy rampage, will be transformed into a shape to launch an attack on Yi Feng ......
<br><br>However, he was just about to transform into a shape when a surprised voice came.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"What a big kingfisher!"
<br><br>As the voice fell, a paw stepped on and landed on Bo Gu's tortoise shell!
<br><br>This foot made Bo Gu, who was just about to transform, stifle back, like a hundred thousand mountains pressing on top of his head, even Bo Gu, who was as strong as a demon emperor, was unable to move a single step.
<br><br>"This?"
<br><br>"What kind of power is this?"
<br><br>Bo Gu, who was stepped on, stared in astonishment.
<br><br>But what was even more intense in his heart was anger and humiliation!
<br><br>He had the body of a demon emperor, but he was actually being stepped on by a human, how could he endure it?
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>"You must die!"
<br><br>Bo Gu roared hysterically in his heart, while the Demon Emperor's surging power worked wildly in his body, struggling hard in an attempt to roll over and attack from under this paw.
<br><br>"Good you old bastard, actually still quite strong?"
<br><br>Feeling the force coming from the bottom of his feet, Yi Feng also came to temper, put down the bamboo basket, grabbed the old bastard under his feet and lifted it above his head and dropped it heavily.
<br><br>This fall, the fall of Bo Gu dizzy eyes, eyes starry.
<br><br>Hatred in the heart, but also in this fall, turned violently into fear.
<br><br>He unbelievably found that the huge power of his own demon emperor, in front of this human, actually can not be exerted!
<br><br>This was the first time he had seen such an evil and incredible thing!
<br><br>"really Mortal?"
<br><br>He suddenly thought of something.
<br><br>Could it be that this person is a human, an expert who has reached Martial Saint or Martial Emperor?
<br><br>Otherwise, how else could he have such out-of-this-world means and be so bold as to completely ignore his Bo Gu Demon Emperor's authority and run directly inside his cave to pick water spirit grass.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Thinking of this, he immediately drew a breath of cold air, if this is really the case, it is able to compare to his demon saint or demon emperor of the demon world ah!
<br><br>Under such means, how could he, Bogu, have any chance?
<br><br>What to do?
<br><br>Bo Gu heart panic into a ball of numbness, this is his biggest crisis since he became a demon emperor.
<br><br>While he was thinking about his countermeasures and didn't know what to do, Yi Feng's gaze happened to glance at the centipede on the side.
<br><br>"There's actually a centipede this big?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, centipede this thing can be disgusting ah!
<br><br>But the speaker has no intention, listening to the heart, the centipede was directly scared a shiver.
<br><br>This human's terrifying, he is really seen, first the black feather shot dead by a shovel, after the demon emperor trampled underfoot, this strength, he did not have any desire to make a move with this human.
<br><br>So the next moment, he belly flopped, and lay motionless on the ground.
<br><br>"Playing dead?"
<br><br>Bo Gu saw this scene, and immediately stared.
<br><br>Good you night wind centipede, the emperor is in danger you do not come to escort it, but actually in front of the emperor pretended to be dead, is simply angry with me also!
<br><br>But this also gives a wake-up call to Bo Gu ......
<br><br>Hesitation for a moment, he also simply gritted his teeth, eyelids rolled, crunching a trip to the ground, a motionless.
<br><br>Although he the Lord Demon Emperor actually have to play dead to save his life is quite stifling, but in order to be able to escape the poisonous hands of this human, there is no way.
<br><br>Anyway, no one will see.
