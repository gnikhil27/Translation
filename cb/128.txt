"That, that's actually ......?"
<br><br>Li Renhao's voice trembled.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin solemnly nodded her head and said, "Not bad, this wangbei is the Bo Gu Demon Emperor you are talking about!"
<br><br>Receiving the confirmation, Li Renhao's body trembled.
<br><br>She took two steps backwards, unable to slow down for a long time from the shock of this information.
<br><br>At that time, she was still disdainful of this king's hawk and did not even look at it. But who would have thought that the Wang Biao that this youth was walking around with in his hands was that Bo Gu Demon Emperor!
<br><br>Her mouth drew a cold breath backwards.
<br><br>It turned out.
<br><br>He was the existence that was so terrifying that he broke into the Demon Emperor's cave alone and captured the Demon Emperor!
<br><br>Originally. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>It wasn't luck at all that he was able to survive in this mountain, but that the rioting demon beasts in this mountain couldn't pose any threat to him at all!
<br><br>Only now, in retrospect, she realized that she should have understood long ago.
<br><br>Just ask, she is a Martial King are perilous, many times almost killed, a mortal how can be able to survive by good luck alone?
<br><br>And the latter's always aloof and out-of-the-ordinary posture is not at all pretend ah!
<br><br>However, when remembering what she and Yi Feng had said, Li Renhao face could not help but redden to the neck, and more than that, she wanted to find a crack in the ground.
<br><br>Her words, in Yi Feng's opinion is probably very ridiculous!
<br><br>It is also good that, her previous those irreverent words, and did not cause this one displeasure, otherwise ......
<br><br>Thinking about it, it's shame and fear again!
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu said with a slightly respectful expression.
<br><br>"It's you guys!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, while looking his gaze at Li Renhao and smiled, "I didn't expect you to be there."
<br><br>Upon hearing that, Li Renhao's usually slightly frosty face was instantly turned red.
<br><br>Obviously, at this moment, she faced Yi Feng again, no longer the previous calm, but instead full of restraint, coyly for a long time, and only then nervously spoke: "See you, sir."
<br><br>However, although the heart is constrained, but she still subconsciously surveyed Yi Feng a glance.
<br><br>Exceptional dust.
<br><br>Extraordinary temperament.
<br><br>Especially Yi Feng is always the look with a faint smile, as if everything is in his planning, facing even the biggest things can not make him frown.
<br><br>The funny thing is that she had not been aware of it before and only felt comfortable with this mortal contact.
<br><br>And for this sister's name, Yi Feng is not surprised.
<br><br>From the five features to see, that Li Jiaxin and Li Renhao have a few resemblance, I'm afraid there is some kind of kinship, and Li Jiaxin are because of his zither skills to call him Mr., he, a junior to follow the name, naturally also in the reasonable.
<br><br>"Well, I said there is no danger inside this mountain, right?" Yi Feng said with a smile again, "You see I'm not well now!"
<br><br>However, Yi Feng's words once again made Li Renhao's face red.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words were obviously sarcastic about what she had said before, but of course, she could only blame her eyes for not being able to see Yi Feng's true identity.
<br><br>A few people, some pleasantries.
<br><br>But after some pleasantries, Yi Feng thought the three would go, but did not expect that Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu had a crop of conversation with him, especially in front of him to praise Li Renhao.
<br><br>What Li Renhao outstanding talent ah.
<br><br>What comprehension is very strong ah.
<br><br>I the master to teach him some waste of her qualifications and so on ah ......
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng feel quite unhappy.
<br><br>Your apprentice good talent off his hair thing ah, he fucking is to see him can not cultivate, deliberately in front of him deceitful disgusting people?
<br><br>Besides, he rushed a day, tired to death, really do not want to accompany these people forced.
<br><br>Another yawn, Yi Feng really can not support, finally opened the door and said: "Now this day has been dark, three still do not leave?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu, who was vigorously praising Li Ren in front of Yi Feng, suddenly looked stagnant, his face turned red, and swallowed back the next words in his mouth.
<br><br>And Li Jiaxin glance at each other, the two eyes are full of disappointment.
<br><br>They had hoped that this person could also bring some opportunity to Li Renhao, but he did not seem to have such an intention, and even directly gave an expulsion order.
<br><br>This expulsion order, they do not dare not put in mind, had to respectfully bow out.
<br><br>Only the departure of the eyes, still reluctant to leave.
<br><br>"If only this senior could bring some chance to Renhao, ah!" While sweeping towards the outside of the mountain, Xu Mozhu sighed softly.
<br><br>"Alas, yes!"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin sighed, but her heart was also quite a bit disappointed that her hopes were dashed.
<br><br>This kind of powerful existence, usually can not see at all, it is easy to see one also hitched, but did not let Li Renhao get a chance, simply sad ah!
<br><br>"Aunt, master, forget it!" Li Renhao flashed her eyes, said with a complex expression: "I have spoken out against this senior many times before, he can not count the past, is already a great fortune!"
<br><br>After saying that, she lowered her head.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>The two Li Jiaxin sighed and said no more, with only an endless low in their expressions.
<br><br>But at that moment, Li Renhao seemed to remember something and raised her head abruptly and said, "No, that senior has long given me the chance!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>At these words, the two people with downcast expressions fiercely looked over with hot eyes.
