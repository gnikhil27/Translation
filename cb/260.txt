Peng Xian'er back to the Heavenly Sword Sect in addition to better torment Yi Feng, there is partly because she wants to personally return to the sect to inform the Heavenly Sword Sect Sect master.
<br><br>Now this situation if it continues, that high person's chance, the Heavenly Sword Sect is not even a hair to get.
<br><br>She finally notified the Heavenly Sword Sect Master Duan Qingfeng, but the latter heard the news that although he came out of customs, but due to a certain aspect of cultivation, he must stabilize two more days before leaving the sect.
<br><br>After all, although the opportunity is tempting, but can not let themselves go off the rails.
<br><br>After returning from Duan Qingfeng's place, Peng Xian'er reappeared in front of the imprisoned Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Kneel down!"
<br><br>As soon as she saw Yi Feng, Peng Xian'er was filled with anger, and her long sword landed on Yi Feng's neck, emitting an icy cold voice.
<br><br>Yi Feng felt the cold mane on his neck, but was indifferent.
<br><br>"Are you really not afraid of death?"
<br><br>"Well, well, I'll see how long you can be stiff as a little mortal."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was simply so angry that she vomited blood, but the more Yi Feng was like this, the more she wanted to torture Yi Feng. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Saying that, she pushed Yi Feng to a heavily guarded place.
<br><br>The deep place.
<br><br>There was a gate that shone with a long cold light.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, inside this door in front of you is my Heavenly Sword Sect's Prisoner Dragon Domain, inside it is lined with crises, you will suffer the most horrible things in the world inside, I am giving you one last chance, if you kneel down and kowtow, I can give you a painful death, but if you don't, I will make you experience the most painful death in the world!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er stared at Lin Feng with an icy gaze and threatened in a deep voice.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that Yi Feng actually didn't even look at her and brushed himself off and walked inside the cold door.
<br><br>"What, you ......"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was so angry that her body trembled, but Yi Feng had already disappeared.
<br><br>"Well, well, a little mortal actually dares to walk in by himself, when you experience the horror inside, I believe you will regret kneeling down obediently."
<br><br>Saying that, she sat down directly in front of the door.
<br><br>The intention was to let Yi Feng suffer inside for half a day before releasing him.
<br><br>One should know that this Dragon Prisoner Domain was a closed space made up of formations.
<br><br>Inside the lack of air, the breath is violent, even a breath is extremely difficult, in addition to the gravity inside is countless times the outside world, and also sealed with many ferocious demonic beasts, although these demonic beasts because of years of sealing the reason for the loss of cultivation, but such as hungry wolves in order to survive, once they smell the breath of a living person, will be like a hungry wolf pouncing on food.
<br><br>In this prison dragon domain inside, even a martial emperor shut in, if you do not know how to open the formation, I am afraid will be slowly consumed to death, and finally become the rations of those ferocious demon beasts.
<br><br>And a mortal went in, not to mention.
<br><br>Half a day.
<br><br>Also enough for Yi Feng to feel the feeling.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes shifted, another picture presented in front of him.
<br><br>A barren.
<br><br>The ground is littered with dead bones, giving a heavy depressing feeling.
<br><br>But Yi Feng also just frowned, and did not show the fear of mortals should.
<br><br>In fact, all these years, Yi Feng's heart hiding a thing.
<br><br>Hidden for many years.
<br><br>Since he crossed over and fused with the system, he found that he had become a little different.
<br><br>As we all know.
<br><br>People have seven emotions and six desires.
<br><br>Will be happy, will be afraid, will be sad, will be disappointed ......
<br><br>However, after he fused the system, he found no more fearful emotions.
<br><br>Whether it is before encountering the bandits, or Peng Xian'er will put the sword on his neck, he may subconsciously make some escape, shrink head of panic actions.
<br><br>But really think about ......
<br><br>Afraid of it?
<br><br>And not afraid.
<br><br>On the contrary, the heart, a group of calm.
<br><br>This feeling is very wonderful.
<br><br>It is as if, he was born with, not afraid of anything in the world.
<br><br>Even more ridiculous is that he vaguely felt that this is not afraid, is from the subconscious within the emboldened.
<br><br>But not afraid is not afraid, does not mean that he does not have the proper thinking, encounter danger will still respond, or will avoid.
<br><br>"I do not know if there is really no way out of here, explore it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked in a direction and slowly marched.
<br><br>"Grass, many beasts."
<br><br>Stepping on the withered land, suddenly a group of beasts rushed out.
<br><br>These beasts are very frightening, one is hungry skin and bones, some of the skin fell out, hissing and grinning appearance, as if to rip Yi Feng to pieces.
<br><br>Yi Feng could not hide, had to take out a dagger, and these demonic beasts began to kill.
<br><br>Soon after, there were more than a dozen corpses of beasts lying on the ground.
<br><br>"Good for you, dead woman!"
<br><br>"There are so many beasts in here, it seems you really want my life!"
<br><br>Yi Feng spat and cursed with a cold face.
<br><br>Originally he did not want to have too much involvement with this woman, but the other party really wants his life, then this revenge Yi Feng took down.
<br><br>Although he is a mortal, but never a soft persimmon.
<br><br>Since you screwed me, I'm sure I'll get you too!
<br><br>Continue walking.
<br><br>More and more beasts pounced towards him.
<br><br>These ferocious beasts maybe other mortals can't handle, but Yi Feng doesn't have to, after all, he can practice a national art that is comparable to God.
<br><br>All the way past, all the way corpses.
<br><br>This is the first time Yi Feng felt that he practiced martial arts in this foreign world, not useless, at least these beasts can still handle.
<br><br>At the end of the day, Yi Feng found that he could not touch a single beast.
<br><br>And finally, he also found the end of the walk.
<br><br>In front of him, a glass-like hazy wall appeared, blocking his way.
<br><br>This kind of wall is very peculiar, some protrude, some concave, diamond-shaped piece is very irregular, looking to the sides, found that this glass-like wall has been continuous, can not see the head.
<br><br>Domain doorway.
<br><br>The seated Peng Xian'er opened her eyes.
<br><br>A cold smile was revealed.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, I don't know how you're doing inside, I'm afraid you're just guarding the entrance, crying and begging me to let you out!"
<br><br>With a cold smile, she waved her palm and barked, "Open the domain door."
<br><br>"Yes, Holy Maiden."
<br><br>The two disciples activated the formation, and the domain gate light slowly dissipated, and a dense desolate aura came to the surface.
<br><br>Feeling these auras, even with Peng Xian'er's cultivation level, she frowned, because if she was allowed to stay inside the Prisoner Dragon Domain for a few days, she was afraid that she would also go crazy.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Opening the door, there was not a single shadow to be seen.
<br><br>"Where is everyone?"
<br><br>Her face changed and she exclaimed.
<br><br>She steadied her mind and exerted her cultivation to step into the Captive Dragon Domain.
<br><br>As soon as she walked into the range, she felt her paws sink, and it was difficult to even lift her feet with her Martial Sect cultivation exerted, and the desolate aura immediately caused her cultivation to be affected as well, and it started to become flocculent.
<br><br>But walking into a look around, there was still no sign of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's mouth was open, her face full of disbelief.
<br><br>Because in this difficult environment, Yi Feng, in addition to squatting in the doorway feeling desperate, it is impossible to run far, and even lifting a footstep is not seen to be able to do.
<br><br>But such a big living person, just disappeared out of thin air?
<br><br>"Holy Maiden, better hurry up and come out, that mortal must have been carried away by the demonic beasts inside the Prisoner Dragon Domain, if you don't come out, it won't be easy to clean up in case something goes wrong." The two disciples reminded.
<br><br>After making sure again and again that Yi Feng was nowhere to be seen, Peng Xian'er then hurriedly withdrew from the Captive Dragon Domain and closed the domain door again.
<br><br>"It's cheap to die like this."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er exhaled reluctantly, and then prepared to leave.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>But she had just taken two steps when the entire Heavenly Sword Sect suddenly emitted an earth-shaking sound that shook the sky and earth like an earthquake.
