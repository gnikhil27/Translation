The sky is filled with sand, not an inch of grass.
<br><br>The air is emitting bloodthirsty brutality everywhere, the smell of decay and decay after death is pervasive.
<br><br>Withered bones all over the ground, vultures eating flesh.
<br><br>Yi Feng was stunned in place for a long time, looking at the scene in front of him, simply a big drop in the eyes.
<br><br>Immortal world should not be ...... immortal air floating ......?
<br><br>Yi Feng trembled and raised his feet.
<br><br>An action led to the vulture looked up, each of them revealed blood-red eyes, so that Yi Feng hurriedly retracted the raised foot.
<br><br>The blood-eyed vulture hissed and rose, and the sound of its cry scared the air and curbed the clouds!
<br><br>Yi Feng was so frightened that he retreated repeatedly.
<br><br>Backward in the feet by the dead bones tripped, hands pressed to a cold and soft things.
<br><br>Looked down, a black body of the three-eyed black mamba is spitting letters at himself. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The snake's body wrapped around and bit on Yi Feng's arm!
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhh ！！！！" The alarming scream immediately tore the weird dark and low space.
<br><br>Yi Feng screamed and jumped up and flung away the viper in his hand, and then without hesitation manipulated the dagger in his shoe thundering a knife cut in the arm.
<br><br>While sucking wildly while bleeding!
<br><br>Damn, the other cross-over male lead to kill the world to sleep with a beautiful woman to take charge of the country, turning his hand into the clouds and overturning his hand as rain, he met in this foreign world for twenty years.
<br><br>The whole twenty years ah!
<br><br>The woman did not touch, did not pretend to have, the fucking will not be a snake to bite the dead, right?
<br><br>Until the ground were vomited a puddle of blood, Yi Feng also stopped to run the breath twelve weeks of fine detoxification.
<br><br>Determine the body a trace of poison are gone, Yi Feng only then continue to start walking in the Gobi desert.
<br><br>The animals here are all mutated.
<br><br>Those bones are also, man does not look like a ghost.
<br><br>As for the living, he had never seen one. There is no human population at all.
<br><br>After walking in this desert for a long time, Yi Feng finally saw an altar.
<br><br>The altar is surrounded by four sky-high pillars, each with a black chain tied to the pillar.
<br><br>The chains extended toward the altar and converged in the center of the altar.
<br><br>In the center of the altar is a cage with four sides trapped by chains.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood below, looking up at the altar above. The gusty wind mixed with sand and decay blew.
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his hand, blocked the head still looking at the altar.
<br><br>What is that place?
<br><br>There are cages, then there may be people around.
<br><br>When you meet someone, you can ask about this place.
<br><br>Yi Feng stepped forward, before the person reached, a voice like a flood bell shaking the sky came from all sides.
<br><br>"The sinner Jiang to, as the Lord of a continent, but rebel against the nine heavens, solid exile to the Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>The voice fell, the chain began to shake.
<br><br>Light and shadow flashed in the cage, and a human figure appeared.
<br><br>The prison door opened in response to the sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng was overjoyed.
<br><br>Oops! Finally, we found a living person!
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly ran to the altar. At this time the cage has opened, inside out of a woman in red.
<br><br>A fire-red dress, in the gale of the wind hunting.
<br><br>Like a fire burning in the desert.
<br><br>Face cold and stunning, such as the cold winter ice spring.
<br><br>Open as the July sun, and cold as the waxing moon frost.
<br><br>"This woman, dare to ask where this place is?" Yi Feng hurried up to the altar and asked the woman in red.
<br><br>The woman in red turned her head, cold and stunning beautiful eyes swept a glance at Yi Feng, and turned back, pursing her lips without saying anything.
<br><br>"Hey, that, I just want to ask, what is this place?" He asked again.
<br><br>The woman in red did not turn her head, and her gaze swept over the entire desert continent.
<br><br>"No...... wouldn't be a deaf and dumb person." Yi Feng looked at looked at the woman in red murmured.
<br><br>The woman in red still did not have any reaction, just calmly looking into the distance.
<br><br>Under the calm gaze was a dark surge of emotions.
<br><br>"Poor thing." Yi Feng looked at the woman, shook his head and sighed, "In vain a good skin, but a deaf and dumb."
<br><br>"Pity ah, pity ah ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng said, thought about it, or go forward, began to compare the gesture, "You, this place ......"
<br><br>And pointed to the head, "know?"
<br><br>The woman in red looked at Yi Feng, her face expressionless.
<br><br>And then the hand reached out, pointing to the side of the altar.
<br><br>Yi Feng followed the gaze, only to find that the corner next to the altar, crooked standing a one-person-high stone monument.
<br><br>Stone monument has been buried half by the sand.
<br><br>And the monument, has also been covered with a thick layer of yellow sand.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked to the stone monument, waving away the yellow sand on the monument with his hand. Revealed the three words on the stele.
<br><br>Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>Nothing more. Yi Feng turned to the back of the stele again and waved away the yellow sand.
<br><br>Immortal world death row, exile heavy punishment place.
<br><br>Yi Feng eyes white, fierce pinch to their own people.
<br><br>God, not it ......
<br><br>Random teleportation transported him to a place of exile for felons ......
<br><br>After slowing down Yi Feng forked his waist and stared viciously at the stone monument.
<br><br>Gnashing his teeth.
<br><br>After a long while, Yi Feng turned his head and walked briskly towards the woman in red.
<br><br>"This lady, let's make an alliance."
<br><br>The woman in red finally turned her head and looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>From the beginning to the end, for the first time, she really focused her gaze on Yi Feng.
<br><br>The icy cold eyes had no emotion.
<br><br>"I said, we ......" Yi Feng pointed at her, and then pointed at himself. Suddenly two fingers hooked up, "Ally!"
<br><br>"Find ...... together," he loosened his fingers and pointed his right index and middle fingers outward one after the other, "the way out!"
<br><br>The woman pulled the corners of her mouth, but there was no smile under her eyes.
<br><br>And then turned his head, silent.
<br><br>"Harm ......" Yi Feng long sigh, helpless and desperate, "so easy to find a person, but a mute."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng was disappointed to walk towards the altar down.
<br><br>The yellow sand swept by, blowing his clothes tumbling. He could not help but slow down his steps in the gale.
<br><br>At that moment, an emotionless voice suddenly came from behind him.
<br><br>"What is your strength?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was delighted and turned his head to look at the woman in surprise, "You're not mute!"
<br><br>The woman did not respond.
<br><br>"Oops, that's great!" Yi Feng said and sprinted back, "I don't have to make so much effort to talk!"
<br><br>Yi Feng ran back again and said, "Let me introduce myself, my name is Yi Feng, Human Immortal cultivation."
<br><br>"Human Immortal?"
<br><br>The woman frowned slightly, "How did you come to this place?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled bitterly, then told the woman the reason why he came here, and then hurriedly said, "Lady, these are not the point, the point is let's join forces and leave this hellish place?"
<br><br>The woman first froze when she heard the words.
<br><br>Meaningfully glanced at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Then a voice came out rather mockingly.
<br><br>"Dark Shadow Island, the space contains the power of rampage and cannot be cultivated."
<br><br>"Here, no matter what your cultivation level is, you can only be slowly ground to death."
<br><br>"Go out, it is even more delusional."
<br><br>"As for you human immortal ...... more need not be making unnecessary struggles ......"
<br><br>Finished, she did not pay attention to Yi Feng, lifting his feet slowly towards the side, showing some bitter smile and resignation, sitting down.
<br><br>Yi Feng saw this, a mouthful of turbid air dense in the chest, stuck uncomfortable.
<br><br>It was a while before he covered his chest, a bitter look on his face.
<br><br>"Sins!"
