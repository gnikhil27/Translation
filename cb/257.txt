After some weighing, the many bigwigs of Nansha also did not choose to go back, but continued to follow Yi Feng.
<br><br>Although Ma Baoguo's status is high, but it is not necessarily able to give them benefits and opportunities.
<br><br>But following Yi Feng's ass, but whenever they could pick up something, just like the snake soup before, let them get huge benefits.
<br><br>"Damn it!"
<br><br>Seeing the group not leaving, Peng Xian'er's face under the veil turned extremely gloomy.
<br><br>Although she was good in strength, but with Li Shuhua, Yang Tianyu and the rest of the older generation here, it was impossible for any chance to be in her hands.
<br><br>Even the current her, even the fifth Changkong and Yun Xian Que can not beat.
<br><br>But she sent countless audio jade slips to the Heavenly Sword Sect Sect Master these days, but the latter still did not reply.
<br><br>This means that the latter is still in seclusion.
<br><br>This makes her anxious, in case that the supreme master leaves some more opportunities to be obtained by Li Shuhua and others, then the overall strength of other sects improve, then his Heavenly Sword Sect will become the real hanging tail.
<br><br>Hesitated for a long time. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>She made a major decision and intended to take a desperate gamble.
<br><br>She quietly broke away from the large group and headed towards the Plum Immortal City ahead of her, Yi Feng and the others, who were now staying in the inn in Plum Immortal City.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>She didn't want to wait passively anymore.
<br><br>Instead, she was ready to take the initiative to approach that big shot.
<br><br>The Reading Friends Inn.
<br><br>"Let's rest in this Plum Immortal City for a day today."
<br><br>In the room, Yi Feng called the crowd together while holding a money bag in his hand and said, "Of course, you can also go to the nearby bazaar to stroll around and buy some local specialties or something."
<br><br>Saying that, he counted ten gold coins for each person and handed them over.
<br><br>But looking at the bag that became lighter in his hand, the flesh pained his hand again, and said with a smile, "How about eight, eight is almost enough, haha ......"
<br><br>Said, he cheekily from the hands of the crowd, one by one to draw back two.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>The crowd did not dare to have an opinion, took the coins and hastily thanked them, then retreated.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>There was still a head looking at him next to him, and if he wasn't wearing a mask, I'm afraid that the eye-catching look was very vivid.
<br><br>"What are you looking at me for?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked without good humor.
<br><br>"Aba Aba, what about me?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei asked in a humble voice.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at him and asked in a deep voice, "Didn't I give you a gold coin last time, and you used it up so quickly?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei didn't say anything.
<br><br>But Yi Feng knocked him on the head with a chestnut.
<br><br>"You're such a loser!"
<br><br>"How hard life is you don't know, look at how much expenses so many people have along the way, just gave out a whole forty-eight pieces, did I pick up my money?"
<br><br>Yi Feng black face, no good lecture: "But you, not to say that you can not earn, but also open your mouth every day, I do not know who taught you to be generous, a whole gold coin you used in a few days, you have the courage to ask again?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei aggrieved, a small voice muttered: "But, but I do not have money in your place?"
<br><br>"It exists in my place, how dare you say that?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a stern face: "Then I'll do the math with you, all the way over here, you ride the carriage to buy money, right, and your face that mask, also I bought for you, right, in addition to many other miscellaneous."
<br><br>"But, also can not use up so much, right?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said quietly, finished his head hastily a shrink.
<br><br>"Okay, you've learned to talk back, right?" Yi Feng stood up in anger and said, "Yes, it is true that the money is not used up, but you do not use it in the future?"
<br><br>"I have to save it to buy clothes for you, shoes and masks for you, and future expenses?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei aggrieved head down.
<br><br>"Okay, okay, here's one for you."
<br><br>Looking at Bone Ben Wei's appearance, Yi Feng took out a gold coin and gave it to him, while explaining, "I'm warning you, you'd better save it for me, I won't give it to you the next time you ask for it."
<br><br>Receiving a gold coin, Bones Ben Wei planted his head and left the room in a depressed mood.
<br><br>"I guess they all went out, so I'll go shopping myself!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cleaned up a round, changed into a dress and left the inn.
<br><br>On the balcony.
<br><br>A bone, a dog and a centipede, emotionally depressed lying here, looking at the street downstairs passing crowd.
<br><br>"Brother, you also do not be sad, this is not slowly save slowly save, you have also saved three gold coins." The dog softly comforted: "You save another ten years eight years, always able to you dazzling once."
<br><br>"Qing ah, you don't comfort me, I am now hopeless, I don't feel interested in anything." Skeleton Benwei shook his head in a depressed mood.
<br><br>Ao Qing was not feeling well in his heart, and when he didn't know what to do, he suddenly saw a woman in red walking by in the crowd downstairs and quickly shouted, "Brother, look, look, there's a long leg there."
<br><br>"Where is it, where is it?"
<br><br>At the word, just a dead image of skeleton Ben Wei full blood resurrection, hurriedly out of the sound to probe out to look out.
<br><br>"Look brother, that figure is also good."
<br><br>At this time, next to the small centipede also came out an excited voice.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei looked his head towards the other side again.
<br><br>But after looking at it for a while, he sat down on the ground in dismay and said sadly: "It's hard to see, but not to move."
<br><br>The more you say, is the more uncomfortable, fierce a moment to stand up.
<br><br>"No, I can't stand it, the big deal is to be demolished."
<br><br>Saying that, he grabbed a centipede and dog, quietly came to the door of Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>"Brother, you've got a lot of guts?" Ao Qing said in shock.
<br><br>"Shhh!"
<br><br>"Do not speak, you two go to the street to watch, the master came back in time to tell me."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei instructed.
<br><br>Looking at the big brother's urgent look, Ao Qing brothers two is also open-minded, immediately ran downstairs.
<br><br>"Hee hee hee ......"
<br><br>Rubbing his hands together, Bones Ben Wei barged into Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>And at this time.
<br><br>Downstairs of the inn, came a woman in white, she probably confirmed the room after some poking around.
<br><br>And changed into a relatively revealing clothes, lifted the veil, revealing the exquisite face.
<br><br>Taking a deep breath, she walked towards Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>"With my posture, I'm still sure of it."
<br><br>"Besides, the hero is sad to see the beauty, not desperate, and how can you be a man of the people?"
