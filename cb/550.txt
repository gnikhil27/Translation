The blinding light shot the seven sisters unable to open their eyes.
<br><br>When they heard the voice, they looked at the person who spoke, and the seven were dumbfounded.
<br><br>"The stars are shining tonight, love you, no, love you all with a heart full of love."
<br><br>Skeleton Benway pinched his fingers and gently lifted the black robe on his chest.
<br><br>In front of the chest is a black heart, and constantly "thumping" beating.
<br><br>"Send for the beautiful Lu, would you like to dance with this scum under the starlight?"
<br><br>The seven women looked at Bones Ben Wei in horror and shock.
<br><br>This is this ...... black-robed dwarf, was not thrown into this death spirit killing formation by the master? It's been more than ten hours, but it's unharmed?
<br><br>No, not only unharmed, even, and even subdued this killing formation to control life and death, the most powerful death spirit king!
<br><br>A few people looked at the Spirit King who was prostrate next to the black-robed man.
<br><br>How powerful this should be! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>They can't imagine how powerful!
<br><br>Seeing the seven people did not respond, Bones Ben Wei dazzlingly flung his forehead, "介个夜针不戳，让人心醉，我的心也醉。"
<br><br>He threw his forehead back again, "Your hearts are not drunk?"
<br><br>"What about us?" The woman in green also shivered.
<br><br>Such a powerful person, they are afraid of a bad luck!
<br><br>"How dangerous this death spirit killing formation is, others don't know, we know best." The woman in red transmitted to several people, "Our cultivation level is not low, usually cultivation in here an hour can not stay, or the most edge of this killing formation. This person is profound and unpredictable, we are fighting against him, it is like hitting a stone with an egg."
<br><br>"Then what do you mean, seventh sister?"
<br><br>"Obey him!"
<br><br>"Huh? This!" The woman in blue's face paled, "If the master finds out, the seven of us will definitely die!"
<br><br>"This person is not only unharmed in the middle of the killing array, but also subdued the death spirit spirit king, just this one, is more powerful than the master!" The woman in red said, the six people next to her were still hesitating and hesitating, she had already twisted her waist and went up to the front.
<br><br>"This brother is so suave and elegant, it's really unseen!" She twisted her waist and walked towards Bone Ben Wei. The fiery red skirt swayed with her steps, her lotus steps were graceful, and her full, round buttocks twisted out in an extremely good-looking arc.
<br><br>The other six people looked dumbfounded. The seventh sister's mutiny is too fast!
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei also dumbfounded, he looked at the woman in red, swallowed swallowed no saliva.
<br><br>"Bone Ben Wei brother so X sense oh." The woman in red said, a pat Bone Ben Wei's chest.
<br><br>The hand choked a pain.
<br><br>Damn bones?
<br><br>"Brother's chest is so fine and strong, I can't bear this small hand, brother quickly blow."
<br><br>The red-clothed woman's body went soft and fell into Bone Ben Wei's arms, and raised her catkin-like white fingers at her.
<br><br>"Cool! The blow!!!" Bone Ben Wei shouted with a face full of joy and blew a breath at the woman in red's finger!
<br><br>A strong energy came from the fingertips, instantly attacked the whole body, an instant her eyes widened!
<br><br>"I I I ...... am going to break through!" She spoke warily and closed her eyes.
<br><br>The next moment, opening her eyes, there was no need for her to break through.
<br><br>With a single movement of her strength, a thick aura spread out from her body.
<br><br>"Xuan Xuan Immortal!!!" The six women next to her were appalled.
<br><br>They should know that they were only Heaven Immortals, and the seventh sister had just broken through the Heaven Immortal not long ago.
<br><br>Heavenly Immortal to Golden Immortal without thousands of years simply can not break through, let alone directly broke through to XuanXuan Immortal, this is something that can not even think about!!!
<br><br>Now ...... just because of a breath of air!
<br><br>"Big sister, what to do?!" Next to the woman in blue anxiously said.
<br><br>"Seventh sister is right. Moreover, the master has never treated us as disciples, perennial bundle in here to guard this killing array. It is human nature to tend to avoid harm." The woman in purple said, "You guys see what you can do, if you don't go, he will only have seventh sister in his eyes."
<br><br>After the words, she took the hairpin from her head, her hair seemed like a black waterfall scattered, in the colorful ghost fire gently swing away.
<br><br>She lifted her hair to the side and fluttered toward Bone Ben Wei, "My eyes just accidentally into the sand, brother also help me blow ......"
<br><br>A time this kill formation in the middle of a sweep of the usual silent eerie dark, ghostly fire flashing, music hi.
<br><br>A group of people around a black-robed man jumped up.
<br><br>Only to see the black-robed man's hand touching from the left to the right, from above to below.
<br><br>The skeleton throat laughter suddenly echoed throughout the killing formation.
<br><br>Three days and three nights later, the skeleton Ben Wei is still moving, the seven women can not hold out.
<br><br>Those who shake the glowing dead spirits also tired fainted most of them.
<br><br>The dead spirit king can't stand it anymore, "This energy is too good!"
<br><br>"Big brother, rest and rest ......" he is going to die of exhaustion. The Spirit King couldn't help but speak up.
<br><br>Skeleton Benevolent looked at the Spirit King with dissatisfaction, "Little Spirit, your body is also too bad."
<br><br>"That is that, who can compare with big brother! Big brother's majestic style is invigorating the nine heavens, no one in the world can compare!" Spirit King said, "I really think for big brother, you are great, these little girls can not, no more non-stop they have to be played to death, then big brother will not be less seven interpretation flowers?"
<br><br>"Good point." Bones Ben Wei stopped, and everyone next to him was relieved.
<br><br>Those seven sisters directly collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath.
<br><br>This is too fucking, too able to jump.
<br><br>Several people rested up, not a moment later, the night wind centipede crawled to the stone. Body bowed up, a moment to burrow into the ground, arching the soil into it.
<br><br>After a while, climbed up, eyes crystal bright looking at the skeleton Ben Wei, hands dancing.
<br><br>"Big brother big brother! The great good thing in the sky!!!"
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>"I just smelled the smell of money in the mud!" Night Wind Centipede said.
<br><br>"Oh?" The skeleton jumped up from the stone and said excitedly, "Money? Where where?!"
<br><br>"Right here in the southeast of the barren realm!" Night Wind Centipede pointed to one side and said, "Should we go and scavenge?"
<br><br>"Go!" Bone Ben Wei raised his finger and pointed straight to the sky.
<br><br>In an instant, the weird dark and deep and deadly deserted place fog scattered, and the thick boundary disappeared in situ.
<br><br>Everyone next to me was stunned.
<br><br>This ...... is the killing formation that could not be cracked for several eras broke?
<br><br>Just a finger, of a slight point ......?
<br><br>And this breakthrough, not like his capture of the seven sisters outside the realm, but the real sense of breaking the realm.
<br><br>The Spirit King was trapped here for countless eras, he forgot exactly how long, the original corrupt air freshly assaulted the tip of his nose, he was still in shock.
<br><br>The next moment, however, he screamed.
<br><br>It turned out that the boundary broke and the light shone in after the fog dispersed.
<br><br>This countless days and nights let him almost forget, how the dead can see light!
<br><br>While screaming and wailing and fleeing, the spirit king glanced at Bone Ben Wei and his eyes twinkled.
<br><br>A flash of lightning in the brain.
<br><br>"Big brother big brother, I'm going to die!" The spirit king clutching his head screaming and wailing, "can't for no one before and no one after the handsome and charming people love big brother saddle up to do cattle and horses is the biggest regret in my life, big brother don't!!!"
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei did not even look at him, a wave of his hand, his body was shrouded in a layer of ink-black fog.
<br><br>"Go, go search for gold coins!"
