Rune activation.
<br><br>Space travel.
<br><br>The Art of Time Retraction.
<br><br>As the name implies it is time travel back in time.
<br><br>It was able to allow him to travel back in time and see what happened in a certain time period.
<br><br>After all, the sudden disappearance of the demon drought and the chaos demon made him feel that things were unusual.
<br><br>Here they were both ancient demonic beasts that it had gone to a lot of trouble to get here, and now that they were inexplicably gone, he, the master, didn't even know what was going on.
<br><br>So he was bound to find out what was going on.
<br><br>As he mouthed the words, complicated hand seals faster and faster, time shuttled in his circumference ......
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>He then passed through time and space and returned to the time period when the Devil Drought and Chaos Devil aura disappeared. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The sea level, rippling.
<br><br>Waves rolled up from time to time.
<br><br>But what made the bald man feel incredible was that the sea level and his line of sight were always hazy with a layer of chaotic mist power.
<br><br>Shielded his senses.
<br><br>Let him completely unable to see the real.
<br><br>Also unable to capture, what exactly happened at that moment.
<br><br>"Well, well ......"
<br><br>"I would like to see what is it that is secretly working against me and actually dares to work against me!"
<br><br>A hoarse voice came out from the man's mouth.
<br><br>The hand seal in his hand is actually once again cast away, is also increasingly faster.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Once again, he looked back.
<br><br>Back to the moment when the demon drought disappeared.
<br><br>And as he poured more power, the chaotic mist that was blocking him, finally dissipated quite a bit.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>He could clearly see that the demon drought was swallowed up by an extremely mysterious force in an instant.
<br><br>The Chaos Demon did the same.
<br><br>But that culprit ......
<br><br>Because there was still a faint mist, it was still impossible to see the true sign clearly.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"A bit of tactics, hidden is quite deep!"
<br><br>"But I just want to see, how deep you can hide!"
<br><br>The bald man's mouth coldly snorted, the handprint in his hand once again accelerated, also reached the limit.
<br><br>It was already so fast that it was impossible to see clearly.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Chaos mist to a difficult state, layer by layer break open.
<br><br>But when he thought he could finally see what was happening, the time look back had a problem.
<br><br>There was no demon drought on the sea level.
<br><br>Even more, there was no Chaos Demon.
<br><br>Not even one other creature could be seen.
<br><br>The only thing on the sea level was a toad with a white belly, floating on its back, following the waves.
<br><br>The man's eyes widened.
<br><br>Only ......
<br><br>Only one toad?
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>He focused his eyes on the toad's body.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>That toad turned over with a flip, legs staring in the water, and actually stood up humanely.
<br><br>A pair of forelimbs with hands, the pair of round toad eyes also glared straight at him.
<br><br>This glance.
<br><br>Let countless distances away from the bald man sweat hair stand up.
<br><br>Almost seven souls and six spirits are directly scared away by this glance.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>The toad raised its forelimbs again and pointed at him.
<br><br>"You make me feel disgusting, so I am too lazy to eat you, but those things you parasitize are good food, so in the future you will come once a month, just enough to be able to feed me for a year!"
<br><br>"If you obey, I will leave you alive!"
<br><br>"Or else spell vomit, I frog Ben Wei also swallowed you."
<br><br>The toad's mouth was slightly open.
<br><br>An abrupt voice came into the bald man's mind.
<br><br>Subsequently.
<br><br>The time look back technique was forcibly interrupted.
<br><br>The sea level was still so calm.
<br><br>The only thing that was floating on the sea level was a belly-flipping toad with its front limbs resting on the back of its head and its hind limbs crossing its legs.
<br><br>However, far away from the bald man, but the body is weak and sitting on the ground, staring with eyes eyes full of fear.
<br><br>In the mind.
<br><br>Still echoing those words from before.
<br><br>Meaning ......
<br><br>That mysterious toad, not only a glance to see that he was peering through the time back eyes.
<br><br>Also through his time look back art, the reverse glance through his original body.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>His body is precisely a cultivated parasitic worm.
<br><br>Through his parasitic skills, he parasitized on a strong demonic beast, controlling the soul and fusing its body together for his use.
<br><br>And apart from the dead demon drought and chaos demon, there are exactly twelve more huge demon beasts that he parasitized.
<br><br>That is exactly ...... one year.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>Yi Feng was carrying tea in his left hand, carrying a large bunch of grapes in his right hand, lying on a lounge chair and swaying, squinting at the distant sea view.
<br><br>Just at this moment.
<br><br>The system's voice came in his mind.
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, for receiving the monthly collection of Qi luck points from the Immortal River Continent."
