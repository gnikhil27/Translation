"My name is Yi Feng, dare I ask the two ladies their surnames?" Yi Feng asked politely.
<br><br>"Bai Piao Piao."
<br><br>"This is my sister Mao Mao."
<br><br>The woman in white said softly.
<br><br>"Meet Miss Bai, Miss Piao Piao."
<br><br>"Come, eat something."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, then wrapped in lotus leaves, tore off two pieces of meat and handed them to Bai Piao Piao and Mao Mao.
<br><br>"Hey, you're so greasy and dirty looking, my miss won't eat it." Mao Mao said with a small frown.
<br><br>"Mao Mao must not be rude." Bai Piao Piao lightly lectured, then looked apologetically at Yi Feng and said, "Since it is made by Mr. Yi's own hands, then Piao Piao will thank Mr. Yi."
<br><br>After saying that, Qian Qian jade hand took the chicken handed to her by Yi Feng, but only tore off a small piece and sent it into her small Yin Tao mouth.
<br><br>Obviously, she did not have much interest in Yi Feng's food, tore off a piece, but also only out of courtesy to Yi Feng. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But when that food was passed into the mouth, the calm-faced Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes frowned gently.
<br><br>"Gongzi this food, so delicious."
<br><br>She couldn't help but sigh in admiration.
<br><br>Originally, with her cultivation level, she had long since stopped eating fire and smoke, but the chicken that was just crispy and tender, with both taste and texture, whetted her appetite, and she couldn't help but tear off another small flap.
<br><br>"Ah Miss, is it really delicious?"
<br><br>Mao Mao was a little unconvinced.
<br><br>Because she knew Bai Piaoqiao better than anyone else, she was someone who never had much appetite for food, yet she gave such an exclamation that she couldn't help but be shocked.
<br><br>So, also hurriedly tore off a small flap.
<br><br>"Huh, it's really delicious."
<br><br>Mao Mao is a straightforward girl, the moment the deliciousness reached the tip of her tongue, her big eyes couldn't help but light up.
<br><br>"I'm sorry to laugh."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded plainly.
<br><br>The two girls' performance was not out of his expectation, but rather within his expectation.
<br><br>Most of the people in this world are busy with cultivation and livelihood, eating things other than simple seasonings, not even salt and MSG, the first time to taste his cuisine from the country on the tip of the tongue, it is too normal to have this reaction.
<br><br>Yi Feng's blandness, so that the white floating slightly impressed.
<br><br>She rarely praised people, before in her clan, countless outstanding disciples can get her more than a glance, but also can not help but float.
<br><br>But this mortal, but not in the slightest.
<br><br>Are you pretending?
<br><br>She watched him.
<br><br>Face sincere, eating his own food, drinking his own wine, immersed in his own emotions ......
<br><br>There was no pretending.
<br><br>Nor was there the slightest hint of artifice.
<br><br>Moreover, his gaze was pure, his words were not frivolous, and he did not even give a second glance to her beauty.
<br><br>This mortal, really a bit interesting.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao sized up Yi Feng, red lips unconsciously raised, suddenly asked: "How do you think of me?"
<br><br>"Cymbidium, gentle and generous." Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao raised a pretty eyebrow and added: "You know that's not what I'm asking ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head helplessly and said, "Beautiful as a heavenly fairy, charming."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao covered her mouth and smiled.
<br><br>"Then does the gentleman like it?"
<br><br>Asked the words, Bai Piao Piao's pupils shrank slightly, observing Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Like it."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head honestly.
<br><br>Yi Feng's answer, let Bai Piao Piao surprised, so undisguised to say, unexpected, unexpected! Let her can't help but ask again, "Why?"
<br><br>"Slender ladies, gentleman martyrs."
<br><br>Yi Feng took a sip of wine and said bluntly.
<br><br>"Good phrase slim lady, gentleman good martyr." Bai Piaoqiao couldn't help but let out a sigh of admiration, and in her heart, she was impressed with this mortal.
<br><br>She asked again, "It's just that I can't figure out ......"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"If you like me, but why don't you look at me more?" Bai Piaoqiao raised the corner of her mouth and asked, "Could it be that Gongzi was telling lies just now?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head helplessly.
<br><br>"That's just me liking it, the girl is not my person."
<br><br>"And there is one more word."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Don't look at me unless I'm rude."
<br><br>"Gongzi really impressed me, golden words come out frequently." Bai Piaoqiao couldn't help but get up and slightly owed towards Yi Feng, "I have to say, today the little lady has learned a lot from you."
