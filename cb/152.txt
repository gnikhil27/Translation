"Seeking death!"
<br><br>Seeing this, several black-clothed people next to Ao Qingcheng finally couldn't hold back, never expecting Ao Qing to be so shameless, in a moment, several people with demonic Qi leaking out, they wanted to make a move towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>"Stop!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng coldly shouted.
<br><br>On hearing this, several black-clothed men gritted their teeth reluctantly, but were forced to retreat due to Ao Qingcheng's might.
<br><br>After the black-clothed men retreated, Ao Qingcheng took a deep breath, suppressed the anger in her heart, and redirected her gaze towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>"I know that you still have deep scruples against me regarding what happened at the beginning, you are afraid that I will harm you, I can understand."
<br><br>"How about this, in addition to what I promised you just now, I can also make an exception and let you join my Red Sun lineage!"
<br><br>Bo Qingcheng continued to throw interest and said: "Although you yourself is the patriarch lineage, but you as a tribal people also understand, my red sun lineage in the tribe is the strongest, almost all the strong people of the tribe is my red sun lineage, as long as you join my red sun lineage, then you Ao Qing is equivalent to have a huge mountain, despised you, the future in the tribe will be a human The existence of the upper man!"
<br><br>"This, is my last step back, you should not refuse it!"
<br><br>Once this heavy bomb was thrown out, Ao Qingcheng re-surfaced with a confident smile. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The Red Sun lineage not only had an outstanding status in the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe, but even had a great fame among the entire demon race. And those who can join their lineage are almost all the first-class strongest and first-class geniuses in the tribe.
<br><br>With this mountain behind, Ao Qing can almost walk across the entire Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan!
<br><br>She didn't believe that Ao Qing could resist such y confusion.
<br><br>However, Ao Qing's action once again exceeded her expectations, and even gave her a white glance.
<br><br>"Ao Qingcheng, don't waste your efforts, I will not promise you."
<br><br>"As for relying on the mountain?"
<br><br>Ao Qing emitted a cold voice, and when it came to relying on the mountain, he shook his head even more disdainfully.
<br><br>After saying that, he was ready to leave.
<br><br>"Stand still!"
<br><br>But he had just taken two steps when Ao Qingcheng's Demon Emperor cultivation behind him finally exploded, and under Ao Qing's always contemptuous eyes, no matter how well-cultivated she was, she finally couldn't stand it anymore.
<br><br>"You don't toast the wine and eat the penalty wine!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng gritted her teeth and drank, and along with this exasperated voice, a heavy pressure blasted down on Ao Qing.
<br><br>"You are a trash who was expelled from the tribe, what makes you look down on the benefits I promised you, and why can't you look at the divine items that are close to holy products, and what makes you indifferent to joining my Red Sun lineage?"
<br><br>"You are a fop, when you heard my promise, you should have prostrated yourself in gratitude, but why do you have to act so pretentiously?"
<br><br>Dog Ao Qing's footsteps gave a slight beat.
<br><br>"Pretending?"
<br><br>"Heh!"
<br><br>With a cold laugh, he looked back at Ao Qingcheng and said, "Ao Qingcheng, you really think too much, I really can't see your promise!"
<br><br>"As for why I can't see it, then I might as well tell you."
<br><br>"Because."
<br><br>"I have recognized a powerful human as my master!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, the strong pride in Ao Qing's eyes is not hidden in the slightest, and the worship of that human in his words is even more from the bottom of his heart.
<br><br>"Follow him, not to mention ten years, even less than half a year, I will be able to enter the demon emperor realm you said, so your promise, you say to me ridiculous or not?"
<br><br>"And in his place, let alone your broken iron that is close to the holy product, even if it is a true holy product, an emperor's treasure, I can also sleep with it every day, so I will still want your broken iron?"
<br><br>"As for your last comment about relying on the mountain ......"
<br><br>Speaking of which, Ao Qing gave another cold laugh.
<br><br>"First of all, let alone my master this backing mountain, even if my master under the command of the skull brother cover me, I put the South Sand Demon Sect Song Ke trampled on the ground, no one dares to put half a fart!"
<br><br>Ao Qing's proud voice shook the surroundings.
<br><br>"So, not to mention these messy promises of yours, you Ao Qingcheng are equally unworthy to be put in the eyes!"
<br><br>"Even the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan is no more than that!"
<br><br>"Because I, who follow my master, will have even greater achievements!"
<br><br>"I, Ao Qing, will ascend to a bigger stage, and will make it difficult for you to climb higher, and for you, Ao Qingcheng, to catch up!"
