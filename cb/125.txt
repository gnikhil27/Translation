"Renhao!"
<br><br>Two people passed out shout, swept towards the sword-wielding woman by the broken cliff.
<br><br>The woman's pretty eyebrows moved slightly, her pretty face revealed a look of surprise, looking back at the same time as her pretty face, her body stood up slightly.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>She first bowed towards Xu Mozhu, and then hurriedly looked at Li Jiaxin and said, "Aunt, why are you here too."
<br><br>"Hmph, my niece ran into danger, do you think I, as an aunt, can't come?" Li Jiaxin said in a good-natured manner, but looked at Li Renhao's eyes, but full of love.
<br><br>"Thank you, aunt!" Li Renhao said softly.
<br><br>After a brief greeting, Li Jiaxin realized that Li Renhao's body was not lightly injured, immediately frowned and asked: "Renhao, what is going on inside this mountain, you are a Martial King expert, as long as you do not encounter the Demon Emperor, you have the strength to protect yourself, how to get to this point to ask for help?"
<br><br>Hearing that, Li Renhao pretty face of the joy of reunion immediately closed, replaced by a strong gloomy.
<br><br>Especially when you think back to the experience of the past few days, many times around the danger, simply with the knife mouth licking blood is no different.
<br><br>She took a deep breath before she was willing to touch the memories she didn't want to recall and explained to the two elders, "A few days ago, I took the disciples of the Royal Sword Sect into the mountains on a mission, and we were careful along the way, and we usually went around when we encountered demonic beasts, so we haven't encountered any danger since we entered the mountains." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"But on that day, three demon kings and more than a dozen demon spirits without warning will siege us, in this battle, the Royal Sword Sect's other disciples were all killed, and I was also no match for the three demon kings, and it took all kinds of cards, which saved a life, which escaped!"
<br><br>"But these demon kings pursued me relentlessly, not only blocked the entire mountain range, it seems to have called in a lot of reinforcements from other territories."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Li Renhao's pretty face, is still full of heart palpitations.
<br><br>The two people listening at the side, Li Jiaxin, also tightly frowned, in Li Renhao's simple words, it was heard that she had a fierce journey.
<br><br>"It's okay Renhao, it's not with aunt." Li Jiaxin hurriedly approached Li Renhao, gentle arms hugged her heartily said: "It's okay, it's okay, except did you figure out in the end, the cause of these demonic beasts suddenly rioting in the end what is it?"
<br><br>"It was caused by man."
<br><br>Li Renhao took a deep breath and said.
<br><br>"Artificially caused?"
<br><br>Xu Mo Zhu was slightly surprised.
<br><br>"Good, it's a very scary person!" Li Renhao said in a solemn tone: "I searched the soul of a small demon, according to the memory of this small demon know that it was this horrible human directly broke into the cave of the Bogu Demon Emperor, not only robbed the Bogu Demon Emperor of a valuable herbs, but also took this Bogu Demon Emperor said to stew. Bo Gu demon emperor under the demons so angry, issued a killing order to find this human, which led to the mountain demon beast riot!"
<br><br>At these words, Xu Mozhu and Li Jiaxin face suddenly became wonderful.
<br><br>After the two looked at each other, they asked in unison towards Li Renhao: "The Bo Gu Demon Emperor you are talking about, is it a king's hawk?"
<br><br>"Yes, his original body seems to be a nearly ten-thousand-year-old king baka all the time!" Li Renhao nodded and turned his puzzled gaze to the two, asking in surprise, "But Auntie, Master, how did you know that this Bo Gu Demon Emperor was a kingly octopus?"
<br><br>"Because, we've seen that king bugger!"
<br><br>The two people looked at each other with bitter smiles on their faces, and in their hearts they instantly straightened things out.
<br><br>The horrible human that Li Renhao said, I'm afraid that is the one they met on the way here, after all, to stew the demon emperor to drink this style of action, they have only seen in this one!
<br><br>And that so-called Bo Gu demon emperor, is not that what they saw, that tree hanging on the king of the eight?
<br><br>"You guys have seen it?"
<br><br>Li Renhao's beautiful eyes widened incredulously.
<br><br>The two nodded solemnly, and their next words even made Li Renhao cover her red lips in shock.
<br><br>"Not only have we seen that kingbug, we have also met the one you are talking about, the terrifying existence!"
