Yi Feng gave a bitter smile.
<br><br>But after knowing the danger inside this mountain, Yi Feng planned to wait in place. Also ready to wait for Yun Yaoyao's cultivation recovery, and then together out of the mountain.
<br><br>Otherwise, with the condition of the two of them, let alone encounter what the bull demon, even if they encounter a powerful demonic beast, I'm afraid it is not easy to solve.
<br><br>Time passes slowly ......
<br><br>Solitary man and woman in this cave to live the day.
<br><br>Yun Xiaoyao daily sitting cultivation, attempting to open the body's seal.
<br><br>And Yi Feng is responsible for the two people's daily food and drink, busy and happy.
<br><br>"Let's talk about it?"
<br><br>This day, Yi Feng is ready to go out again, after a moment of hesitation squatting in front of Yun Yoyao said.
<br><br>"You say."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao opened her beautiful eyes and looked at Yi Feng. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I feel like I'm at a loss, you save me once, I save you several times, I still have to be responsible for your food and drink every day, once I go out I'm on edge, afraid of running into demon beasts." Yi Feng said with a frown.
<br><br>"A cultivator's favor, isn't it enough for you?" Yun Yaoyao's beautiful eyes moved slightly and asked rhetorically.
<br><br>"Why, I want a favor from you to have a gross use, this is all false." Yi Feng gave Yun Yoyao a white look and said, "You give me something real."
<br><br>"Then what do you want real?" Yun Yoyao asked.
<br><br>"I wanted to get something from you cultivators, but I don't think I can use it, so you give me some gold coins!" Yi Feng grinned, "Give me a million or eight hundred thousand, I definitely don't mind too much."
<br><br>Yun Yoyo gave Yi Feng a complicated look.
<br><br>Then he said, "Do you know that a cultivator's favor can't be bought with money, a million or eight hundred thousand gold coins may seem a lot, but to us cultivators, it's nothing, so you really plan to ask for gold coins and not my favor?"
<br><br>"Yes, I'll take the gold coins."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>Thinking that with this wave of gold coins, he could finally make up for the blood that Nan Sha used up.
<br><br>Back can also go back to the martial arts hall decoration decoration, and the yard that recliner should also be changed, leisure money enough to get a maid, this day is simply beautiful.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao nodded: "I can give you a million gold coins, but not for the time being, have to go out and talk."
<br><br>"That's a good deal, you give me an IOU."
<br><br>Yi Feng said beautifully, then took out a paper and pen.
<br><br>"Today, Yun Yaoyao, owes Yi Feng one million gold coins, sign as proof."
<br><br>Yi Feng wrote on the paper, then tapped it in front of Yun Yoyao, and said with a smile, "Come on, sign."
<br><br>Yun Yoyao's face imperceptibly twitched.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's look of not giving up without signing, finally gritted her teeth and nodded, and finally signed her name under Yi Feng's gaze.
<br><br>"Comfortable."
<br><br>Yi Feng carefully kept the IOU, put it away in his arms, and did not forget to pat it with satisfaction.
<br><br>After collecting the IOU, Yi Feng carried Yun Yaoyao's long sword and went out to look for food.
<br><br>But yet, he could only find some wild fruits or something, and then with the specialties Yi Feng carried on his belly, because once Yi Feng tried to barbecue, and really attracted two beasts after he was afraid.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng just walked out of the cave, the cave inside the Yun Yaoyao face is a change.
<br><br>Although she now has no cultivation, but she was able to perceive, not far outside the cave, there are several demonic beasts.
<br><br>And the strength of these demonic beasts is not weak.
<br><br>This made her gaze to the extreme.
<br><br>Because according to this situation, Yi Feng who went out was bound to run into these few demonic beasts.
<br><br>"What should I do?"
<br><br>She twinkled her beautiful eyes, but in a state where her cultivation was completely sealed, plus her external injuries had not yet healed, she had some difficulty even walking, not to mention going to rescue Yi Feng.
<br><br>Although this mortal sometimes seems quite hateful to her, but she does not resent.
<br><br>But just when she didn't know what to do, she suddenly noticed that the aura of those demonic beasts, suddenly disappeared.
<br><br>"Did it go away?"
<br><br>"That Yi Feng ...... would not have been ......"
<br><br>Thinking of this, her heart panicked.
<br><br>Despite the fact that she had not recovered from her injuries, she braced herself and walked towards the outside of the cave.
<br><br>But just as he reached the cave door, he saw Yi Feng carrying a long sword and cursing as he walked back: "Damn, a few unopened wild boars also dare to attack me, do you really think I am a vegetarian, at least I am also a trained martial artist."
<br><br>"You're not dead?"
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng unharmed, Yun Yaoyao was frozen.
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>"Expecting me to die?"
<br><br>"Are all women so black-hearted?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a black face, staring at Yun Yoyo.
<br><br>"I don't mean that." Yun Yaoyao explained: "It's because I sensed the aura of demonic beasts outside the cave, I thought you ......"
<br><br>"The breath of demonic beasts?"
<br><br>Yi Feng face a panic, quickly an arrow step across to Yun Yoyao's side, eyes alert asked, "You do not scare me."
<br><br>"You don't need to worry, their breath has disappeared, they should have gone." Yun Yaoyao said, then looked at Yi Feng and asked again, "But you really didn't run into them just now?"
<br><br>"No, instead, there were a few small beasts that didn't open their eyes, so I cut them down." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's face was unbelievable.
<br><br>This, it doesn't make sense.
<br><br>With the strength aura emitted by those few demonic beasts before, it was impossible that they did not find Yi Feng outside the cave.
<br><br>But since they were definitely able to discover Yi Feng, yet they did not attack him, instead, they directly left, what does this mean?
<br><br>"Are you sure you didn't see it?" Yun Yoyo asked again.
<br><br>"Really no." Yi Feng shook his head, suddenly remembered something and said busily, "The demonic beasts you mentioned, it wouldn't be the beasts that I cut down, right?"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's face was covered with a cold frost.
<br><br>These demon beasts are at least at the level of demon clan according to their aura, and can be hacked to death by a mortal like you?
<br><br>"You're thinking too much."
<br><br>She gave Yi Feng a glance, and then retraced her steps back to the cave.
