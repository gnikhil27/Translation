Interesting.
<br><br>Really interesting!
<br><br>Over the years, anyone who was in front of him was submissive and didn't dare to breathe a peep.
<br><br>So, he can't remember the last time he ate at the same table with someone else.
<br><br>Let alone ......
<br><br>someone else made such a request to drink his wine?
<br><br>He stopped the guards behind him, turned his interested gaze to Yi Feng, and said leisurely, "Little brother, you know that this wine of mine is not something that ordinary people can drink."
<br><br>Saying that, his eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>He was curious to know how this little mortal would actually respond in the face of his dilemma?
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that Yi Feng said with a relaxed face, "Then I'm really not an ordinary person."
<br><br>"Oh?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This made the middle-aged man raise some more interest and asked leisurely, "Then tell me, how are you not an ordinary person?"
<br><br>"Remember, think of a good answer."
<br><br>"If you don't answer well, I'll cure you of presumption."
<br><br>Yi Feng chucked a mouthful of food into his mouth while smiling, "Do you think if I were really an ordinary person, I would sit at the same table with you and eat?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The middle-aged man was stunned.
<br><br>After reacting, he was greatly appreciated.
<br><br>"Well, well, good one, not ordinary."
<br><br>For a moment, the gaze that looked at Yi Feng turned intriguing.
<br><br>If he thought that Yi Feng was interesting before, but that was all.
<br><br>This feeling is like a person who sees an interesting mole, and on a whim will observe him for a while, but after that, he will not be interested anymore, after all, a mole is a mole.
<br><br>But at this moment, he really was a little impressed with Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng's answer, it is too second.
<br><br>He was not only able to solve his difficulties, but also lifted him a wave, and he could not refute it.
<br><br>Because if you really refute it, is not it demeaning that you can not?
<br><br>"Come, I'll pour you a cup, but only this one." The middle-aged man personally lifted the jade bottle and helped Yi Feng fill up a cup.
<br><br>"Good wine."
<br><br>Yi Feng took a small sip and couldn't help but sigh in admiration, "If I could drink this kind of good wine every day, then life would be too happy."
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the guards behind the middle-aged man were filled with anger.
<br><br>If the middle-aged man had not stopped him, he would have slapped this mortal to death.
<br><br>Don't even look at who is sitting opposite you, the attitude is actually so disrespectful.
<br><br>And just that small cup of wine do not know how precious, to be able to pour you a cup is your life to cultivate the blessing, and want to drink every day?
<br><br>Really whimsical.
<br><br>"By the way, my name is Yi Feng, drink the wine of the old brother, have not yet asked what is the name of the old brother?" Yi Feng asked as he ate his food.
<br><br>"Desolate Pathless!"
<br><br>The middle-aged man said.
<br><br>"The name is quite nice."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and asked, "By the way old brother, you're not a cultivator, are you?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing looked at Yi Feng, and after a slight hesitation, he shook his head and said, "No, I am not, I am just a ...... well, a merchant, yes, I am just a merchant."
<br><br>"So that's it." Yi Feng nodded his head qi and laughed, "Then it seems that you should have no spiritual roots for cultivation, just like me."
<br><br>"How dare you!"
<br><br>These words finally made that black-clothed guard unable to endure anymore.
<br><br>How dare you say that your majesty does not have cultivation spiritual roots, simply blind your dog's eyes, if this little mortal of yours knew about your majesty's cultivation, I'm afraid you would be scared to death.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>However, Desolate Wuji reprimanded, "Where is your place to speak here?"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard was frightened with cold sweat, and hurriedly shut up and retreated.
<br><br>Only then did Desolate Wujing smile and said to Yi Feng, "Little brother, don't mind, the guards are just not directors."
<br><br>"It's fine, it's me who is abrupt."
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't mind saying, but his gaze was intentionally looking at Desolate Wujing's wine jug.
<br><br>Scratching his head, he finally asked embarrassedly, "Older brother, is there any way that you can pour me another cup?"
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Desolate Wuji laughed out loud, such an interesting mortal, it was really the first time he had seen one.
<br><br>It had to be said.
<br><br>He was very comfortable in contact with this mortal.
<br><br>At least he can say what he wants to say, do what he wants to do, not like other people, in front of his obsequious, stand afraid to stand, sit afraid to sit.
<br><br>As the saying goes, the stronger the strength, the more lonely it is.
<br><br>So strong as he is, will also come to this kind of secluded place, sitting in a small tavern, drink, see the local customs.
<br><br>And at this moment and Yi Feng simple get along, but let his heart rose a long-lost feeling.
<br><br>"Little brother is a reader, right?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing re-looked up and down Yi Feng and asked.
<br><br>"Yes, and no, half." Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"Okay then, I'll test you then."
<br><br>Desolate Trail gaze flickered, thinking about the problem, just saw the wine jug placed next to it, and said, "Then little brother will make a poem with wine within half a moment, if you can make it, today's wine is for you to drink, if not, then I will turn my face away."
<br><br>"Within a moment, wine for poetry?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head and asked, "What else do you want?"
<br><br>"No requirements, just that you can make it within the specified time." Desolate No Path laughed.
<br><br>"If it's so simple, then it's my turn to have a drink today."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corners of his mouth, and under the dumbfounded gaze of Desolate Wuji, he took the jade bottle and began to pour himself wine, while laughing: "I have met you for the first time, just like an old friend returning. Let's share a drink and get drunk."
<br><br>When his voice fell, the wine was just filled up, and Yi Feng raised his cup and stretched it towards Desolate Wuji.
<br><br>Desolate Wuji looked at Yi Feng blankly.
<br><br>After reacting, he laughed out loud.
<br><br>"Good one, it looks like the old man has returned, it seems that little brother and I really see each other as if we are old friends!" Desolate Wujing hastily lifted his wine cup and clinked it with Yi Feng.
<br><br>After drinking a glass, he refilled it for Yi Feng.
<br><br>No longer did he skimp on the jade bottle of wine.
<br><br>For a while, the more the two talked, the more they got to know each other.
<br><br>After three rounds of wine.
<br><br>Yi Feng burped and got up and said, "Old brother, wait for me for a while, I also have a dog, I'll send something for it to eat."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng lifted a packed meal and walked towards downstairs.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back, Desolate Wuji smiled, full of appreciation.
<br><br>But the black-clothed guard couldn't help himself and asked in a hurry, "Your Holiness, a mere mortal, why do you need to ...... is this not a waste of your time?"
<br><br>"Humph, what do you know?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless scolded in a deep voice: "At least I look at him, much more comfortable than looking at you."
<br><br>The black-clothed guard's face was ugly.
<br><br>I really don't know what kind of luck this mortal had gotten, to actually be able to gain the favor of His Holiness.
<br><br>I don't know how this little mortal will look like when he finds out the true identity of His Holiness.
<br><br>I'm afraid, will be scared to pee, right?
