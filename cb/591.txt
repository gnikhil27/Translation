The powerful breath of the sharp-tongued man came toward Yi Feng, and his whole person took off into the air.
<br><br>Yi Feng's first thought was to escape.
<br><br>But the second thought was to give it a try.
<br><br>By the time the disciple trial is more powerful than the Earth Immortal like a carp in the river.
<br><br>It was just as well that he could use this Earth Immortal to try his degree.
<br><br>If the disparity is too big, he has the system, directly yo-yo.
<br><br>All the thinking but a moment, the sharp-tongued man sword qi has not yet been next to him, his body flying away to dodge.
<br><br>Then the finger stretched out towards the sharp-tongued man a little -
<br><br>In an instant, the sharp-tongued man exploded in place.
<br><br>Through the body of a thought finger light continues to shoot into the sky.
<br><br>When Yi Feng reacted, there was only a blur of flesh and blood left ...... one second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng was unbelievable and laughed out loud.
<br><br>This ...... he killed an Earth Immortal perfectionist?
<br><br>By himself a mere human immortal?
<br><br>"Aren't you quite a bully?" He looked at a floor of bloody scraps of flesh and blood and walked forward, wanting to kick a foot.
<br><br>Only when his foot lifted up did he realize that there was nowhere to land.
<br><br>This is too disgusting.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at a ground of flesh scraps.
<br><br>"Sizzle ......" he frowned and sucked in a breath, "What is this for?"
<br><br>He Human Immortal early stage, to the middle stage, to the high stage, Dao perfection, then to the Earth Immortal early stage ...... all the way to the Earth Immortal perfection.
<br><br>This is a difference of seven whole ranks ah.
<br><br>He is a low-level human immortal, can kill the earth immortal perfect immortal?
<br><br>How to think how wrong.
<br><br>Could it ...... be that he lifted his finger and turned it around to look at it more closely.
<br><br>Could it be the reason for the One Thought finger?
<br><br>But this thought finger even if it is practiced to perfection, it is only a low-ranking immortal skill, although the immortal skill is very powerful, enough to support cross-level combat, but can cross so much?
<br><br>Mo can't ...... Yi Feng thought of a thought in his head.
<br><br>Eyes wide open, immediately the system called out.
<br><br>"I ask you, how can I solve the Earth Immortal consummation?" He asked, thinking of a possibility and continued to pursue, "Could it be that I'm not at the lower rank of Human Immortal?"
<br><br>"Ding--" a voice came from the system, "Host strength: unknown."
<br><br>"??"
<br><br>Yi Feng had a question mark.
<br><br>Unknown?
<br><br>"How can you not know?! Didn't you give me my cultivation directly?" Yi Feng asked through clenched teeth, hating to beat the system up, "Damn what stage am I at?"
<br><br>"Ding - unknown."
<br><br>"Are you going to tell me? If you don't tell me, I'll destroy you!" Yi Feng threatened.
<br><br>There was a tremor in his brain, and then the system's extremely like voice rang out, "It can be human immortal."
<br><br>Human immortal?
<br><br>Yi Feng tilted his head.
<br><br>Really human immortal ah.
<br><br>"Human immortal then how did I get him killed?" He looked at the puddle of blood and flesh in front of him.
<br><br>"Rubbish system." He muttered, turning around and walking towards the Star Peak.
<br><br>After a while, Yi Feng had arrived at Star Peak senior brother You Duxing's residence.
<br><br>He walked straight to You Duxing.
<br><br>"Senior brother, I came to ask you something." He asked straight to the point.
<br><br>You Duxing was meditating and looked at Yi Feng when he sensed the movement.
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>"I want to ask, can a low-ranking Human Immortal beat a Perfect Earth Immortal?"
<br><br>The words fell to hear the voice of You Solo denying, "Never possible."
<br><br>"Killing across the ranks is a difficult thing in itself, let alone crossing seven ranks. Absolutely impossible."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, and asked, "What if there is a perfect One Thought Finger?"
<br><br>Hearing the perfect One Thought Finger, You Dao Xing looked directly at Yi Feng. The Sun Moon Sect cultivated into the One Thought Finger quite a few, but recently cultivated and made a big noise, this human immortal senior brother in front of him is one.
<br><br>"You wouldn't be asking about yourself, would you?" He opened his mouth in confusion.
<br><br>Yi Feng also does not hide, nodded, "Exactly."
<br><br>"A low-rank Human Immortal definitely can't kill a consummate Earth Immortal." Said, you alone thought of Yi Feng's extraordinary talent, "Perhaps, the talent is very good and good, rare to see that kind of person in ten thousand years, can do it."
<br><br>Yi Feng heard his eyes shine, "It seems that senior brother is talking about me."
<br><br>Got a satisfactory answer.
<br><br>Yi Feng was about to leave contentedly.
<br><br>With his own talent enriched, although his cultivation level is only human immortal, it seems he can already reach the level of earth immortal perfection!
