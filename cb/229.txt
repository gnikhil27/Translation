"Boom!"
<br><br>A huge sound.
<br><br>Song Ke whole big face smashed on the ground, a huge sound deafening, the ground is trembling, earth-shaking, raising the sky of dust.
<br><br>And the big face did not stop after smashing the ground, but rubbed in the ground a long distance, leaving a huge gully of hundreds of feet, before just stopping at the feet of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"How is that possible?"
<br><br>"What the fuck, what did I see!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the people of the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li Family were instantly scared silly, the scene just now was simply shocking their nerves.
<br><br>Even though this was only the doppelganger that Song Ke had condensed here, its strength was close to that of a half-saint, at least the two of them, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu, were unable to nail him even when they joined forces.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The black-robed man's light action actually made the towering Song Ke fall down. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What kind of terrifying strength is it?
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the big face like a big mountain in front of him, the black robe slowly fluttered, carrying the thin body up in the air.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>"Humble human, I want you to die."
<br><br>And half of the face rubbed into the mud of the big face, suddenly came a trembling, at the same time under the mud is accompanied by an angry voice.
<br><br>Under the huge movement, the whole big face finally lifted up.
<br><br>The face had a hideous expression.
<br><br>Carrying a monstrous rage.
<br><br>However, the skeleton Ben Wei floating in mid-air suddenly lifted a leg.
<br><br>"Make amends, hurry up and make amends to this scum."
<br><br>After saying that, this leg fell and stepped on Song Ke's head.
<br><br>This scene, in the eyes of the crowd and its comical.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei's body is small in front of this big face, like an ant floating in mid-air, stretching out a leg to step on the elephant's head.
<br><br>But this foot, but hard to Song Ke just raised the head, and then stepped down, most of the face buried in the ground.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>This scene directly shook the eyes of the Imperial Sword Sect and the others, and their jaws almost dropped in shock.
<br><br>And the dozen or so demon dignitaries who followed Song Ke, also one by one full of fear, this black-robed man, where the hell is the monster that ran from!
<br><br>Song Ke was actually stepped on by him just like that?
<br><br>"Hey, talk, hurry up and pay for it hear?"
<br><br>At this time, Bones Ben Wei crushed his paws and shouted again.
<br><br>"Hoo hoo hoo ......"
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>"I want you to die ......"
<br><br>Under this kind of humiliation, under the ground came out Song Ke and his angry voice, gnashing his teeth!
<br><br>Once this voice fell.
<br><br>The ground roared, spreading out countless cracks in the ground, as if the world had ended.
<br><br>Then from the cracks in the ground, countless thousand feet long vines spread out, like a giant snake, intertwined in the sky, forming a huge net, attacking towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>At once, the sky was covered.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Help!"
<br><br>"Run, get away from it."
<br><br>And under this wave, many disciples of the Royal Sword Sect and the Li Family received implication, and at once, ghostly cries and howls came out.
<br><br>"OhË±Å?"
<br><br>"Even if you guys don't pay for it, you're still mean to me?"
<br><br>When Bone Ben Wei saw this, he was instantly angry.
<br><br>With another foot, he stomped down!
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>This foot, the ground collapsed, Song Ke's whole big face completely plunged into the soil, squeezed, the sides of the mud piled up into a small mountain.
<br><br>At the same time, the sky filled with vines, also quietly lost the sound, shrunk back, as if never appeared in general.
<br><br>Those demon dwellers looked at each other and ran away without saying a word.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"This guy would rather die than pay for my money!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei fell back to the ground, squatting on the ground full of despair, looking at the small dirt bag just now, sighing.
<br><br>"Brother, there are, there are other hidden treasures, I'll take you there!" At this time, the night wind centipede shouted again.
<br><br>"Oh wang?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei, who was crouched on the ground, jerked his head up and asked, "Seriously?"
<br><br>"Seriously, brother, let's go, it's over there on the hill!" Night Wind Centipede hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>"Ahahahaha, Qing ah, brother's happiness is back, go ah rush ah!"
<br><br>"Wuhu ......"
<br><br>"Ouch, brother, wait for me ah!"
<br><br>"Dog, dog, and me, don't leave me behind."
<br><br>Accompanied by a cheerful yell, three shadows ran wildly all the way, under the countless pairs of eyes of the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li family, and ran away again in a flash.
<br><br>In the passing road, a demonic beast that hadn't had time to run blocked their way and was directly trampled to death as well.
<br><br>Soon, a bone, a dog and a centipede, and ran out of shadows ......
<br><br>Looking at the remnants left behind, the crowd drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>In the end, what are the three immortal big brothers ah?
<br><br>Fools?
<br><br>No, no, no.
<br><br>This is fucking crazy, right.
<br><br>Everywhere they went, there was not even an inch of grass to grow!
<br><br>However, the change brought by those three immortal big guys made a turnaround for the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li family.
<br><br>"Listen to my orders, Mo Zhu, and Miss Li Jia Xin." Yang Tianyu immediately gave the order, "Take the two of you as the leader, bring Renhao and Chenghao to help, and lead the disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect and the Li Family to exit the mountain range!"
<br><br>"The rest of the Martial Exaltation experts, follow me and the two Li family masters to distribute around, prevent all accidents, and safely ensure that all disciples are withdrawn from the mountain range!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The people have received orders, did not dare to delay, and acted in a hurry.
<br><br>Because everyone knew that Song Ke was not dead.
<br><br>The one who was trampled to death by that black-robed man just now was only a doppelganger that Song Ke had used his mind to attach to the countless trees of the mountain range and condensed out of it while breaking the Saint.
<br><br>Therefore, their crisis was not relieved, and when Song Ke slowed down, I was afraid that he would still attack them.
<br><br>"Split!"
<br><br>In the middle of another mountain forest, Zhong Qing jumped up and slashed down with a slash.
<br><br>Then, a wild boar was cut into two halves and fell to the bottom of his feet.
<br><br>"Not bad, good practice!"
<br><br>Behind him, Yi Feng sent out an appreciative voice towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, thanks for the compliment master!" Zhong Qing scratched his head and laughed nervously.
<br><br>"Well, it seems to take you a little deeper, the beasts inside there are more vicious, afraid?" Yi Feng asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Not afraid!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing said resolutely.
<br><br>"Good disciple, let's go."
<br><br>Rubbing Zhong Qing's little head, the master and disciple headed deeper into the mountain range ......
