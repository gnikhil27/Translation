"Let's follow it first."
<br><br>Several people all followed out behind.
<br><br>Once out of the forest, they met many passing Star Peak disciples.
<br><br>At this time, Chunlai pulled the nearest one, "Brother, hurry, call more people, Yi Feng senior ......"
<br><br>"I know I know." The senior brother in front of him patted Chunlai's shoulder, "Just now senior brother Yi has told me. Don't worry, we will all pass."
<br><br>Chunlai let out a sigh of relief, "It's still senior brother Yi who is smart."
<br><br>"This is also considered smart, is bold, right?" Senior brother shook his head and sighed, "How dare you go on the stage of life and death with the Sun Moon Sect Perfect Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"Ah?" Chunlai was stunned.
<br><br>He looked at Yi Feng who was not far in front of him.
<br><br>Only to see him stop and pull when he saw people, "Senior brother, later I want to go on the life and death stage with these five forced, remember to come and see ah."
<br><br>Chun Lai and Xia Wang a few people, look directly petrified ...... a second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Next to the senior brother is still continuing to ask: "But, Chunlai, how come you are so messed up?"
<br><br>Chunlai couldn't answer in time, so he led the people to rush to Yi Feng at the front.
<br><br>Yi Feng soon reached the stage of life and death.
<br><br>Behind him, Chunlai and the others also caught up with him.
<br><br>Constantly persuading.
<br><br>"Senior Brother Yi, stop it! It's not too late to give up!" Chun Wang said anxiously, "Look, there are quite a few senior brothers from our peak around, they can definitely help you set up these five Earth Immortals!"
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng turned his head to look at the crowd and swept his gaze.
<br><br>Seeing this, Xia Wang also hurried to answer, "See, this side is full of our people! Where there is no need to go on what life and death stage such expedient occasion, we directly get them killed on it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stroked his chin, thoughtfully said, "That makes sense."
<br><br>"Oh, you finally figured it out!" Xia Wang smiled and took a long breath, "I'm going to ask my brothers to do it together!"
<br><br>"Makes sense." Yi Feng continued to say to himself, "It can't just be people from our peak."
<br><br>He took a glance over, all the people from Star Peak.
<br><br>How can that work!
<br><br>"Senior brother, please." Yi Feng turned his head and looked at Xia Wang, "Help me go to Sun Moon Peak and call people over, say that I, Yi Feng, want to kill all five trash Earth Immortals from their peak by stepping on their feet."
<br><br>"Ah this?" Xia Wang listened to the foot weak, "this is not to provoke the whole Sun Moon Peak people! Will anger them ah!"
<br><br>"I'm still afraid to provoke no anger." Yi Feng said, "Go on senior brother, how can you piss off how to say, the more cross words the better."
<br><br>"By the way, do not forget Guo Shijie." Yi Feng continued, "Let him come over and see with his own eyes how his disciple was beaten to a pulp by me."
<br><br>Xia Wang's legs went weak and he still wanted to persuade, looking at Yi Feng's firm appearance.
<br><br>He had to stop persuading each other, but thought of telling Liu Yan about this matter as soon as possible.
<br><br>Star Peak.
<br><br>When Liu Yan heard the report from his subordinates, he was shocked.
<br><br>"What? He is a mere human immortal, how dare he go to the Life and Death Stage with five Earth Immortals from Sun and Moon Peak?"
<br><br>"Back to the peak master, exactly." The subordinate replied, "They have all arrived at the stage of life and death!"
<br><br>"Several disciples are still trying to persuade them, they can't even stop them."
<br><br>"Looking for death!" Liu Yan fiercely got up, "Go stop him!"
<br><br>As the words fell, Liu Yan had already disappeared in place.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Guo Shijie also received the news.
<br><br>"Peak Master, that little bastard Yi Feng is going to go to the Life and Death Stage with the five Earth Immortal disciples of our Sun Moon Peak."
<br><br>Guo Shijie said excitedly, "Going on the Life and Death Stage, do you think it's true or not?!"
<br><br>You know he was depressed about his last failed assassination attempt, but he didn't expect that kid to take the initiative to go on the Life and Death Stage!
<br><br>The world is really helping him!
<br><br>The key was that not only could he kill Yi Feng openly and honestly, but Star Peak also had no reason to find him in trouble.
<br><br>It's simply two birds with one stone!
<br><br>"Exactly!" That subordinate gritted his teeth and drank: "That little bastard even let out the word that he wanted you to personally see how our Sun Moon Peak's disciples died tragically at his hands."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"This poisonous boy!!!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie was furious.
<br><br>Slamming the tealight in his hand out fiercely!
<br><br>"Peak Master calm your anger!" The subordinate hurriedly consoled, "Yi Feng is going to die anyway. Why should Peak Master be angry over a dying man, it's not worth it."
<br><br>Guo Shijie forced himself to calm down as he held back his fire.
<br><br>"Well said." He stood up from his position, "Didn't he want this Peak Master to go over there?"
<br><br>"Then let this Peak Master go over there and see with his own eyes how he died without a body." Guo Shijie said, every word said through clenched teeth.
<br><br>Sun Moon Sect.
<br><br>Life and Death Stage.
<br><br>As soon as Liu Yan arrived, he saw Yi Feng being pulled to death by a few human senior brothers, bitterly talking.
<br><br>When they saw Liu Yan coming, several people were like being pardoned.
<br><br>"Peak master, you hurry to persuade him! He has to go to the life and death stage with those five Earth Immortal disciples of Sun Moon Peak!" Chunlai said anxiously, "This is not looking for death!"
<br><br>Liu Yan looked over and saw the five blue-clothed disciples of Sun Moon Peak staring at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Fire was coming out of their eyes.
<br><br>All five were Earth Immortals, complete.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, don't be reckless!" Liu Yan came forward and said, "Do you know that all five of them are Earth Immortal, complete, and raising their hands can make you a human immortal die without a burial place!"
<br><br>Liu Yan came over to personally advise, Yi Feng still gave two points of face.
<br><br>Listen to her finished, Yi Feng face sank down, "I reckless? It was Guo Shijie who wanted to put me to death three times."
<br><br>"You told me not to be reckless?" He arrived, his voice also sank, "Could I just let that Guo Shijie bully and slaughter me? Or even obediently be killed by him?"
<br><br>"That's not what I meant." Liu Yan was helpless, "Think about it, with a cultivation level like yours, wouldn't it be a death sentence to go up there?"
<br><br>"Leave this matter to me, I will protect you. Guo Shijie's side I will also go and take care of it."
<br><br>"Aiya peak master you worry too much." Yi Feng said indifferently, "These are just a few pieces of trash, I can still deal with them, since they are looking for me, I must not let them pass, and also let that dead ratio Guo Shijie see what happens when you mess with me, Yi Feng."
<br><br>Liu Yan frowned.
<br><br>Earth Immortals were indeed trash in her eyes, but what strength was Yi Feng?
<br><br>"I know you have anger, but you are a human immortal, how ......"
<br><br>"Okay." Yi Feng interrupted Liu Yan's words and turned his head to look at her, "Who told you I'm just a human immortal?"
