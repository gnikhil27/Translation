At the same time, the force pulled him toward the ground.
<br><br>Ye Bei's face changed greatly.
<br><br>Before he could react, he smashed into the ground with a loud bang.
<br><br>When he got up with difficulty, he suddenly found a reclining chair placed on the road not far away.
<br><br>On the chaise lounge, a black-robed man with stilted legs was lying, and next to him sat a toothy dog ...... no, a sky-devouring demon wolf.
<br><br>"What are you?"
<br><br>Ye Bei clutched his chest and frowned at the black-robed man in front of him, but found that he could not see anything.
<br><br>But the black-robed man simply ignored him, tilting his head back and continuing to lie on the recliner, seemingly basking in the sunlight, without even looking at him.
<br><br>"I'm asking you, what the hell are you?"
<br><br>Even though he was facing someone he could not see through, the previous attack coupled with the contempt at this moment instantly filled Ye Bei's heart with anger, causing him to drink out his voice directly at the black-robed man.
<br><br>But as soon as Ye Bei's words fell, the black-robed man sitting on the recliner boomed and sat up. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The palm of his hand slowly extended.
<br><br>And then, fiercely pressed down!
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>A piercing sound came out, accompanied by Ye Bei's miserable scream, and it was to see his legs leg bones bursting directly.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Beneath the bursting of the leg bones, Ye Bei, who had just climbed up, directly knelt on the ground, while a strong fear spread out in his eyes, staring deadly at the black-robed man in front of him.
<br><br>"Know what's wrong?"
<br><br>Finally, under the black robe, a cold voice came out.
<br><br>Ye Bei clenched his teeth, his face full of reluctance, and the intense pain made a drop of cold sweat slide down his forehead.
<br><br>However, his momentary hesitation directly caused the black-robed man to disappear, and when he slowed down again, it was already in front of his eyes.
<br><br>A palm fell directly onto Ye Bei's neck and lifted him up directly.
<br><br>"I ask you again, do you know what's wrong?"
<br><br>Under the black robe, the cold voice came again.
<br><br>"I know I know I'm wrong ......"
<br><br>This time, Ye Bei did not dare to have the slightest hesitation, and a stuttering voice came out sharply from his throat.
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>Ye Bei fell back to the ground, but when he raised his head, he found that the black-robed man had returned to the recliner at some point.
<br><br>This scene instantly scared his heart out.
<br><br>The strength of the black-robed man in front of him simply made him feel desperate. He had the cultivation of a Martial Emperor, but he couldn't even catch the shadow of others.
<br><br>What kind of person is this?
<br><br>Why did he stop him here?
<br><br>Inconsolably, he lowered his attitude and asked anew, "Dare I ask senior, at what point did I unintentionally offend you, causing senior to stop me here?"
<br><br>"It is true that you have not offended me." The black-robed man said.
<br><br>This instantly filled Ye Bei with doubt, but before he could speak, the black-robed man said in a deep voice, "But you, have offended my master!"
<br><br>"Your master?"
<br><br>Those words of the black-robed man made Ye Bei confused at that time.
<br><br>The mere existence like the black-robed man normally he could not come into contact with, let alone the black-robed man's master, an existence countless times more advanced, which he was afraid he had never even seen.
<br><br>"Senior are you mistaken about something?" Ye Bei asked cautiously.
<br><br>But just as he finished speaking, he seemed to react and immediately exploded, "You you you, you are from the martial school?"
<br><br>The black robe did not speak, apparently acquiescing.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Bei's throat rolled, swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and his forehead was dripping with cold sweat.
<br><br>He never thought that this terrifying black-robed man in front of him was actually from that martial school again, and from what he said, it seemed that he was also the servant of that Yi Feng.
<br><br>One servant had countless means that he couldn't understand, so how strong was Yi Feng?
<br><br>Gulong.
<br><br>He swallowed another mouthful of saliva, his face full of deadly gray.
<br><br>It seems that this iron plate is a lot harder than he thought it would be!
<br><br>And at this time, the old ancestor of Qingshan and others who were on the same path as Ye Bei also rushed over, just in time to hear the conversation between the two also immediately startled.
<br><br>Mr.
<br><br>When was there a servant so powerful?
<br><br>However, when he saw Ao Qing next to the black-robed man, he confirmed that this black-robed man was indeed from the martial arts school. After all, this dog ...... wolf, and almost let Mr. slaughter to entertain him.
<br><br>Without saying a word, the old ancestor of Qingshan led the crowd to kneel on the ground, not daring to say half a word.
<br><br>"Do you know that you made my master very unhappy by running to the martial school and causing trouble last time?" Under the black robe, he said coldly.
<br><br>When he heard the words, Ye Bei gave a shudder.
<br><br>His head hurriedly knocked heavily on the ground, and his mouth hurriedly explained, "Senior, last time it was me who had innocent eyes, it was me, Ye Bei, who was blind, I implore senior to be able to spare my life!
<br><br>As he begged for mercy, he winked at the Castle Peak Elder one after another.
<br><br>But the Old Ancestor of Qingshan proudly turned his head away, looking as if it was none of his business.
<br><br>Humph.
<br><br>Little man.
<br><br>Even if you have made me angry, you still want me to intercede for you.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, how about giving a favor, at least he is now my brother-in-law." On the side, Zhu Yun put his head over and asked carefully.
<br><br>"Beg Nima!"
<br><br>The Old Ancestor of Green Mountain slapped him on the face.
<br><br>PS: Three more chapters, sorry for being a little late today.
