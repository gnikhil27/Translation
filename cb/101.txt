"How's it going?"
<br><br>At the back mountain of the Explosive Sky Gang, Ye Bei stood with his hands folded.
<br><br>"Reporting to the Sovereign, Lu Qingshan is not doing too well here." Behind him, an elder said with a frown.
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>Ye Bei shrunk his pupils and said in a deep voice, "If I guessed correctly, Lu Qingshan should have seen through my purpose, even this box of Hua Zi he returned."
<br><br>"Then what about Sovereign?" That elder frowned, "And that person you mentioned, is it really that terrifying?"
<br><br>"Terrible?"
<br><br>Ye Bei gave a bitter laugh, his thoughts seemed to go back to that day, his face twitched before he solemnly said, "Terrible is not a sufficient word to describe him."
<br><br>"Alas, to think that I, Ye Bei, have acted cautiously all my life, but I never thought I would commit such a calamity."
<br><br>"Regretful ah!"
<br><br>"So he, how exactly is he strong?" That elder took a deep breath and asked nervously. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"At least Martial Emperor, even ......"
<br><br>"It's Immortal!"
<br><br>The elder's heart thumped, slowed down, and hurriedly said respectfully, "Gang master, I understand your use of bitter conscience, just that old ancestor of Castle Peak oil and salt, what should we do?"
<br><br>"Continue to tell Little Left and Little Right to disdain all costs and use charming techniques to launch an offensive against Qingshan." Ye Bei solemnly instructed.
<br><br>"But Qingshan is after all a Martial King, although he is indeed good at it, but I'm afraid it's not optimistic!" The elder said gruffly.
<br><br>"Don't worry, even if the attack can't Qingshan, Qingshan door is not also have others?" Ye Bei raised the corner of his mouth and said, "Such as those individual elders, and that sect leader Zhu Yun."
<br><br>"What the gang master said." The elders nodded and said: "Only, they that Zhu Yun, seems to have a little heavy taste ah!"
<br><br>"This ...... indeed!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ye Bei also could not help but nod his head approvingly: "But then again heavy, but also need to meet him, it seems to have to send my sister personally!"
<br><br>"Understand help master!"
<br><br>The elder swept down and disappeared.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Two days passed.
<br><br>Ye Bei's heart was on thin ice, and his days were spent in fear, just worrying about when that one would come to his door.
<br><br>"Damn Ye Bei."
<br><br>And at this time, the old ancestor of Castle Peak flew by cursing all the way, these days are really tortured painful.
<br><br>The two women from that Heaven Frying Gang were like maggots on their tarsus, completely just stuck to him, cursing but also cursing and could not be driven away.
<br><br>You say to do it, after all, the Castle Peak family has so many people here, it seems that the status of the two women in the fried sky gang is not low, really do it, that must be another situation.
<br><br>So, at this moment he really can't help it, intend to find Ye Bei to say a clear.
<br><br>"Ye Bei, you do not hide, I know you hide in this back mountain, you get out!" Under extreme anger, the old ancestor of Castle Peak didn't care if Ye Bei was some kind of Martial Emperor powerhouse, he directly cursed.
<br><br>"Cough cough, old brother, what's wrong with you?" Ye Bei swept out with an embarrassed face and said.
<br><br>"Good you Ye Bei, still ask me what's going on, you think I'm not clear about what you're playing for?" The old ancestor of Qing Shan said angrily, "I ask you, did you offend the seniors and want to pull me into the boat of thieves!"
<br><br>"Old brother, I didn't expect you to see it ......" Ye Bei touched his nose and said with a smile: "But don't say it so harshly, what pull or pull on the boat of thieves, I just want you to help me in that senior I just want you to help me in front of that senior, a few words of praise."
<br><br>"Hmph, what good word or not, I will not offend that senior for you!" The old ancestor of Castle Peak said angrily with a red face, "I'll leave it here with you, you can kill me if you want, but it's impossible for me to submit to you, and there's no way my Castle Peak Sect will be in the same stream as your Heaven Blast Gang!"
<br><br>"Old brother, you this ......"
<br><br>Ye Bei touched his nose and said meaningfully, "This is not up to you, after all, if you do not submit, someone from your Castle Peak Sect will have to submit!"
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain eyes glared.
<br><br>"Brother-in-law, come out!" Ye Bei shouted leisurely.
<br><br>"Brother-in-law?"
<br><br>"What brother-in-law?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan stared, and then under his incredible gaze, Zhu Yun walked out with his head lowered in embarrassment, and beside him, a woman who was eight feet tall and weighed more than three hundred was leaning on Zhu Yun's shoulder with a small bird.
<br><br>"You, you you, what's going on?" The old ancestor of Mount Qing stared at his eyes and asked busily.
<br><br>Zhu Yun lowered his head and said with a face full of apologies, "Master, senior uncle, sorry, I I ......"
<br><br>"Brother-in-law is embarrassed to say, let me help him say it!" Ye Bei said with a smile: "Sometimes fate comes can not be stopped ah, brother Zhu Yun in my clan these days, and my sister had a chance encounter, and soon rubbed out the sparks of love, so ah, now our Castle Peak Sect and the Explosive Sky Gang are already in-laws!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Hearing this, the old ancestor of Castle Peak almost spit out a mouthful of old blood, angrily pointed at Zhu Yun and drank: "You, you, in vain you for my Castle Peak Sect patriarch, you actually so useless, actually by so, so a ......"
<br><br>Said, the old ancestor of Castle Peak accidentally looked at Ye Bei sister, immediately covered his eyes, the words can no longer say.
<br><br>It is simply unbearable.
<br><br>Hot eyes!
