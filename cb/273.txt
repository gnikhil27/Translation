But just as he shouted out, Fifth Changkong grabbed his hand and shouted, "Look, look, this negative man's face is showing, he is denying it while taking advantage of others."
<br><br>At a time, the crowd was in an uproar, and more and more people converged towards this side.
<br><br>And at this moment, Ye Wuchen was also pointed out by a thousand people.
<br><br>Such as such a pavilion of women you are cruel to leave behind, so tender woman you also go to hurt ...... and so on such words overwhelmingly spread.
<br><br>And as more and more people, the formation of the bridal party also began to be disrupted.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Change happened once again ......
<br><br>A messy sound came from overhead.
<br><br>Then came the sight of several people with a basket in their hands, pouring out the dense gold coins inside the basket.
<br><br>"A lot of gold coins."
<br><br>"Quickly grab, quickly grab!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>This scene immediately made the situation in the field into pandemonium, countless people looked at these gold coins red-eyed, no longer cared to see what the hustle and bustle, pounced on it and began to grab.
<br><br>"Damn, damn, what the hell is going on!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen cursed with a gloomy face.
<br><br>Only to find that the old man who had just been looking for trouble and the Fifth Longkong pulled their legs out and started running.
<br><br>"Damn it, stop right there."
<br><br>Ye Wuchen grimaced and was about to chase towards Fifth Longkong.
<br><br>"Bah!"
<br><br>However, Fifth Longkong grabbed a pair of buns from his chest and threw them at Ye Wuchen's face, cursed and ran into the crowd without a trace.
<br><br>Also at the same time as the chaos, a black-robed figure mingled with the crowd and quietly got into the palanquin.
<br><br>"Damn, damn, be quiet!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen was squeezed without a shoe, finally enraged, pulled out a long sword from the hands of the next guard and cut out.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>Several miserable screams rang out, blood spilled on the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crazy crowd then quieted down and looked at several bloody corpses, which then scrambled back.
<br><br>"Nope."
<br><br>Killed a few people, Ye Wuchen finally remembered that something is wrong, with the sword swept up in the air, flew to the front of the palanquin, and then violently lifted the curtain.
<br><br>However, the beauty covered with a red head, still sitting there.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Wuchen let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Then shouted: "Send some people to capture those people just now, others continue to return to the Ye family, whoever dares to move again on the way, directly kill without amnesty!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>All subordinates answered in unison.
<br><br>At the same time, a team of people followed the trail towards Yi Feng and the others.
<br><br>"Not good, they are coming after us."
<br><br>Yi Feng covered the retreat of the crowd while shouting to Zhong Qing, "Disciple, you take your wife and run first, we'll cover you."
<br><br>"Yes Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing pulled a black-robed man onto the carriage, then raised the whip and ran.
<br><br>And after Zhong Qing and the others left, Yi Feng said towards Yang Tianyu and the others, "Gentlemen, now I'm afraid we have to trouble everyone to work together, if we don't finish off this group of people, I'm afraid we all won't be able to run away."
<br><br>"Okay sir."
<br><br>Hearing this, Yang Tianyu and the others hastily responded, but their faces were full of difficulties.
<br><br>Finally, is it time to start a fight?
<br><br>Only the bitterness is, how to fight, how much force to use ah?
<br><br>The people looked at each other's eyes, and for a moment no one dared to make a rash move.
<br><br>Just when they didn't know what to do, Pork Rong, Old Man Wang, and Wu Yonghong were already fighting with their pursuers.
<br><br>"Hey-ha."
<br><br>"Hey-ha!"
<br><br>As soon as the two sides touched each other, they started a "fierce" struggle.
<br><br>One of the pursuers raised his palm, and before he could kick out, he saw Pork Rong fly backwards.
<br><br>"Old Wu, they are so strong, they are strong martial artists, come and help me!" Porky Rong shouted with a gloomy face as he clutched his chest.
<br><br>"Old pig, hold on, I'm coming."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong raised a stool and rushed over, but was cut in half with a single slash, Wu Yonghong was immediately scared and backed up, his face was white.
<br><br>"It's really strong!" Wu Yonghong said with a face full of panic: "Zhuge, such a strong expert, I'm afraid we'll have to join forces with three people."
<br><br>"No way, I can't protect myself either, I'm being overpowered by this Martial Artist 8th level expert." Sun Zhuge shouted with a ragged breath.
<br><br>On the other side, Old Man Wang was also being chased around with a knife, and was in danger.
<br><br>The other two, Lu Dasheng and Chu Mad Lion, were likewise not much better.
<br><br>And looking at this scene, Yang Tianyu, the fifth Tianming and a group of Nan Sha's sect leaders looked dumbfounded.
<br><br>Boy!
<br><br>Look at the fierce and difficult fight, worthy of the people who have been following Mr. ah!
<br><br>Admire.
<br><br>Directly make them willing to bow down.
<br><br>And at this moment, Yi Feng had also joined the fight.
<br><br>Seeing this, all the sect leaders solemnly looked at each other, Yun Haotian even said solemnly: "Gentlemen, next we are afraid that we will have to fight the toughest battle in this life, we must give our best and control the force ah!"
<br><br>The crowd nodded, took a deep breath, and also joined the battle.
<br><br>A full quarter of an hour of fighting, Yi Feng and others finally with a subtle victory, and the settlement of this time the battle.
<br><br>Then retreated and disappeared into the alley.
<br><br>Ye Family.
<br><br>A big banquet was held.
<br><br>And Ye Wuchen's bridal party finally picked up the bride back home.
<br><br>As the groom, Ye Wuchen slightly in the banquet round, he then returned to the bridal room. Because to the night can still be early, drink two cups of him, is already completely can not wait.
<br><br>"Mother child, hey hey hey, did you miss your husband ah!"
<br><br>Just entered the door, then saw the petite beauty covered with a red head, Ye Wuchen's eyes were glowing, rubbing his palms and sending out an evil voice towards her.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>That beauty's petite body deflected, and hummed lightly under the red cover.
<br><br>"Yo yo yo yo yo ...... my little heart, still a little temperament, the Sangha I like more, I'll fall, hehehehe ......"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen face squeezed a smile, and hurriedly leaned over, pouting mouth on across that red cover bar a mouthful, and then a lift the red cover.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>Under the red head but revealed a white head.
