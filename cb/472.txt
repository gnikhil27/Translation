The two finally walked into Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The bustling streets were inundated with the sound of hawking.
<br><br>And Yi Feng was riding a flying sword, carrying Su Yun Yun Yun through the streets.
<br><br>Along the way, all kinds of vendors, old men and women greeted Yi Feng, and Yi Feng's posture of passing by with his flying sword also immediately caused a burst of exclaiming.
<br><br>"Wow."
<br><br>"Mr. really powerful."
<br><br>"Mr. is really powerful too, properly the supreme master."
<br><br>"Sir this flying sword, tsk, terrifying as hell!"
<br><br>A polite voice came, causing Yi Feng to arch his hands in embarrassment.
<br><br>"Everyone is polite, you're welcome."
<br><br>Such a scene. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But it made Su Yunyun behind him cry and laugh.
<br><br>The mortal realm is the mortal realm ah, just a flying sword just, hard will Yi Feng this no half strength of the person said so god.
<br><br>She really does not know what to say.
<br><br>I do not know, the mortals in this city, if one day to see a real immortal, what kind of expression will be.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>As the empress, she did not bother to get involved in this some.
<br><br>But for some reason, from the time she entered this city, she had an uncomfortable feeling.
<br><br>It seems that this city is very unsafe?
<br><br>"It should just be an illusion."
<br><br>Su Yunyun shook her head and comforted herself.
<br><br>After all, she who was in first turn Nirvana did not have the slightest bit of cultivation now, and even her normally sharp senses were blocked out.
<br><br>Coupled with her fall in her previous life, it was normal for the cautious her to possess this sense of insecurity.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The two arrived at the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>The martial arts school was the same as always, only nowadays Yi Feng often lived on the island, less popular.
<br><br>"Wu!"
<br><br>Su Yunyun looked up at the martial arts word plaque above her head and had a vague feeling of something else.
<br><br>But what exactly was the feeling, she could not say.
<br><br>"Let's go, go in."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>Led Su Yun Yun into the martial arts hall.
<br><br>Walking into the martial arts hall, the portraits of the eighteen types of weapons were hung all over the sides of the hall.
<br><br>Seeing this, the different feeling in Su Yun Yun's heart rose again, and the kind of insecurity in her heart climbed to the extreme.
<br><br>"Are you sure it's safe?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Solid as a fine soup!"
<br><br>Yi Feng patted his bladder and said.
<br><br>Su Yunyun couldn't help but pull the corners of her mouth.
<br><br>Even the empress palace in her previous life did not dare to call it solid as a fine soup, such a martial arts school with such an adjective ......
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>The eyesight is different.
<br><br>There is no need to care.
<br><br>If she really and a mortal care about these, I'm afraid long ago died of anger.
<br><br>"Okay, you can stay here, I'll go back to the Heaven and Earth Sect first, and come back to you in a few days." After taking Su Yunyun around the martial school casually, Yi Feng walked towards the door while talking to Su Yunyun.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He had just walked to the entrance when he spotted several familiar figures.
<br><br>A black robe.
<br><br>A dog.
<br><br>A centipede.
<br><br>A bear.
<br><br>In addition to that, there was a woman next to him that he didn't know and seemed to be good-looking.
<br><br>And they seemed to notice Yi Feng's gaze, a slip of smoke and ran away, as if they had done something wrong.
<br><br>"Good guys, these few goods finally wave back ah!" Yi Feng couldn't help but pinch his nose, remembered something, turned back towards Su Yunyun and asked, "It looks like you are a little scared to live alone in such a big martial arts school!"
<br><br>"What am I afraid of?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun frowned slightly.
<br><br>It was funny that she would be scared even though she was a female emperor.
<br><br>It just didn't occur to her that she unintentionally showed a hint of emotion because this Pingjiang City made people feel depressed, which was also caught by Yi Feng.
<br><br>Have to say.
<br><br>Although the person in front of you is not much strength, but indeed quite attentive.
<br><br>Long also can.
<br><br>If not for the disparity in status between the two, not the same kind of people, otherwise as their own male pet seems to be good.
<br><br>Looking at Su Yunyun's brave look, Yi Feng smiled heartily and did not point it out, but said, "I'd better find someone to protect you, after all, I'm also relieved some!"
<br><br>"Protect me?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun froze.
<br><br>After slowing down almost angry laugh.
<br><br>When did this emperor, have to let a mortal to send someone to protect?
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>"It's a deal."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and pressed on without waiting for her answer, he had already left.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Said protection.
<br><br>He actually also wanted to find someone to watch her, so easy to get an ordinary disciple, run away what to do?
<br><br>As for the candidate.
<br><br>Yi Feng is already there.
<br><br>Feet on the flying sword, chased up.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, the master came after us, what to do!" The dog shouted in a hurry.
<br><br>"Aiyaaah."
<br><br>"This jagged man has easily saved a few gold coins, is calling a beautiful woman ready to drink a little wine, what to do what to do ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the chasing Yi Feng, and then looked at the little lady next to him, that is a reluctant to give up.
<br><br>But after a balance of pros and cons, he had to take up the woman's jade hands with both hands, nibbled, reluctantly said, "Good north nose, wait for me, we will sing and dance together again at night."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Full of reluctance to take the dog a few, towards Yi Feng to meet.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Welcome over is Yi Feng a flying hair leg.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei was kicked over to the ground.
<br><br>"You dog, taking advantage of women again?" Yi Feng said fiercely.
<br><br>"Wrongly accused!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was pitiful.
<br><br>"I saw it all!"
<br><br>Yi Feng fiercely lectured, "In the future, let me see you take advantage of the girl at will, I can't spare you."
<br><br>"Come here, I have something for you to do."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng beckoned and walked towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei hurriedly followed.
<br><br>"Didn't hurt you just now, did it?" Yi Feng lifted his black robe and knocked on Bone Ben Wei's skull, and although it was hard, he couldn't help but ask in pain.
<br><br>This guy.
<br><br>Although annoying.
<br><br>More or less a bit of emotion ah!
<br><br>"In fact, I can understand you, but I still have to remind you ah, no that diamond, do not take the porcelain work."
<br><br>Yi Feng intoned a long lesson.
<br><br>"Know what I mean?
<br><br>"Do not understand."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at Yi Feng blankly.
<br><br>"I mean, you do not have that guy sh, do not go to provoke people girls, true love to the depths, you that look first not to mention will not scare others, she how you give a solution, you say you how to give people a solution?"
<br><br>Yi Feng two even questioning, touching the depths of the soul.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei directly confused!
<br><br>"The heart means a little on the line, let's go, go back to the martial arts school, give me something to do."
<br><br>On the way, Yi Feng carefully explained to Bone Ben Wei, let him watch this woman, do not let escape, and will reward him with an extra gold coin.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei gladly agreed.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng really brought a black-robed man, Su Yun Yun Yun frowned.
<br><br>"I said, I don't need someone to protect me." Su Yunyun said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"You said it doesn't count, what if you encounter some danger?" Yi Feng gave her a white glance, didn't say much, and directly left.
<br><br>Su Yunyun was frozen in place.
<br><br>Danger?
<br><br>In case of real danger, although she was in first-transformation Nirvana, she was not so low as to allow a mortal to protect her, right?
<br><br>But after thinking about it, she reluctantly accepted it.
<br><br>After all, during her first turn of Nirvana, she was unable to open up, and there was someone who could give her a run for her money.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>She turned her gaze to Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>As it happened, Bone Ben Wei was walking towards her.
<br><br>Stepping with small broken steps.
<br><br>One ta-da, two ta-da ......
<br><br>Turning in a small circle, a small flower was handed out and presented in front of Su Yunyun's eyes.
<br><br>"Auntie, first time meeting, please take care."
<br><br>"The next is the majestic and suave Bones Ben Wei, known as Jagged Man."
<br><br>"From today, I will be like your strong backing, under the protection of my love, the sky is falling can not hurt tired a hair."
<br><br>Said, skeleton Ben Wei very gentlemanly salute.
<br><br>Su Yunyun face black line, goose bumps four.
<br><br>Toes straight scratch the ground.
<br><br>This ugly, greasy, and seemingly not half as strong dwarf, is the person who came to protect her?
