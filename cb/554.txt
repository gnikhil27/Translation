The dozens of people below who were winning, at this time have been like a great enemy.
<br><br>The aura of this person who came down from the sky is too powerful.
<br><br>Before the fight, just by the aura emanating from the body, it is enough to make all their hearts tremble.
<br><br>In the midst of the wind and clouds, the old man above slowly opened his mouth.
<br><br>"A group of ants, who gave you the guts to fight against us?" He slowly opened his mouth, and the energy carried in his voice made the people below deafening.
<br><br>"That's right, who gave you the guts to go against us!" The Genting kingdom ruler emerged from behind the messenger and said in a fox-like manner.
<br><br>At this moment, he was quite a bit filled with hot tears.
<br><br>These few days were too hard to bear.
<br><br>Now that the messenger was here, finally someone was backing them up, and this feeling of having someone to back them up was just too good.
<br><br>"Gryphons who don't know how to live and die, all go to hell."
<br><br>The old man's icy cold gaze swept down. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>It was full of indifference.
<br><br>It was as if everything was a mole in his eyes.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Suddenly, a huge bone hand of gas condensation appeared from the ground, and smashed towards the messenger in the sky with the speed of lightning.
<br><br>This punch.
<br><br>The sky exploded with a loud bang.
<br><br>That huge human face, in an instant, went up in smoke.
<br><br>And the World Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch were staring in disbelief as they were directly lifted out by the airflow of this punch.
<br><br>Turning into two stars, they disappeared with a flash in the distant sky.
<br><br>"In front of this jagged man, you pretend nimrod."
<br><br>The words fell, it was a black-robed man appeared, followed by a dog, a centipede, a bear, and a ghost surrounded by black gas.
<br><br>Then behind, there are seven charming and colorful women.
<br><br>"The Grand Protector! It's the Grand Protector!" The first one to react was Su Yun Yun, who happily shouted, "Join the four great protectors!"
<br><br>The disciples behind her followed suit and saluted, "Join the Four Guardians!"
<br><br>"All get up." Bone Ben Wei waved his hand.
<br><br>"The Grand Protector is really powerful, he slapped that arrogant person to death with just one punch!"
<br><br>The disciples praised one after another.
<br><br>"Not so, so powerful time in addition to the master is exclusive to the great protector!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, my great protector a hand, you know there is no!"
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>The incessant praise, skeleton Ben Wei listened to the jaws are raised.
<br><br>After the Genting Kingdom Monarch and Extermination were nowhere to be found, the Genting Empire was no longer able to resist.
<br><br>Wu Tian quickly annexed the Genting Empire.
<br><br>......
<br><br>The large grassland.
<br><br>At this moment, a bonfire was being lit and dragon skewers were being roasted.
<br><br>The brothers and teachers were gathered around the bonfire, happily dancing in the square.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was lying on the side, next to seven women with delicate figures, one less dressed than the other.
<br><br>One peeled grapes for Bones Ben Wei, one hammered Bones Ben Wei's legs.
<br><br>Some squatted on the floor body to Bones Ben Wei put legs.
<br><br>Some sit next to each other and put their hands in the palm of Bones Ben Wei for him to play with.
<br><br>Thousands of miles away, Yi Feng huddled in a rickety ramshackle house, lit a lamp frantically watching a book, eyes are boiling red.
<br><br>-- "Immortal River Continent Cultivation Levels".
<br><br>Only a short time ago, the two neighboring countries war, the soldiers are in chaos, he in order not to spill this poor pond fish, rolled up the bunk and slipped away.
<br><br>Now to a place where people are not raw and unfamiliar, are yet to find that last one suitable to take as a disciple qualification.
<br><br>"Ding - since the outer disciple reached the ordinary qualification, the host met the cultivation qualification, so he successfully obtained the highest cultivation level."
<br><br>"However, since the last disciple is an outer disciple, it does not make the official disciple count. So the host needs to find the last qualified disciple to take in within one year."
<br><br>"Otherwise retract the cultivation."
<br><br>The surprise that suddenly came made Yi Feng freeze.
<br><br>And then laughed out loud.
<br><br>Laughing back and forth.
<br><br>This pimp chick, what a surprise and unexpected!
<br><br>"Right, talking about the highest cultivation level, let me see what the highest cultivation level is!"
<br><br>Saying that, he flipped open the Immortal River Continent Cultivation Rank in his hand.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor, hahahaha, I'm a Martial Emperor!!!"
<br><br>"The once terrifying as hell Martial Spirit is now dregs in my eyes!"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed happily once again.
<br><br>He couldn't wait to use his cultivation level, and then started towards the sky, with a fierce swing.
<br><br>Sure enough the sky changed greatly, and with each swing of his fist, the sky rumbled.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I'm so bull!"
<br><br>Meanwhile.
<br><br>The Immortal World, at this moment, was in a mess.
<br><br>It had been a long time since the last time the sky was broken by the mysterious man's fist, there hadn't been such a commotion!
<br><br>I thought that the previous punch to break the sky was just a coincidence, so I did not continue to investigate, but which knew that ......
<br><br>This instantly blasted out 500 punches.
<br><br>Punch than last time only heavier than light!
<br><br>Looking at the immortal world suddenly appeared five hundred big black hole, the immortal world all the way out, have the whole load towards the place where the sky is broken.
<br><br>For a time, the immortal world people are on tenterhooks.
<br><br>And in the immortal river continent Yi Feng leisurely collected his fist.
<br><br>To the fist a blow.
<br><br>This waste system is finally reliable for once.
<br><br>At the same time, Yi Feng stopped.
<br><br>Because he found another powerful function of the cultivator, that is, the divine sense.
<br><br>For example, at this moment, he is divine sense sense to a long way away, a group of people are laughing and dancing, some feasting.
<br><br>And that kill the dwarf, but also left embrace, drunken life and forget to die.
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>The joy of successfully getting cultivation was quickly suppressed by indignation.
<br><br>"This group of mixed up waiting for death waste, not properly refining themselves, but actually there to have a quick time, and actually all of them are gathered together!"
<br><br>"And that dog thing, said no not to frivolous girls, how dare they also invited seven at once!"
