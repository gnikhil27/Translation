Then it was seen.
<br><br>On the list at the head of the martial arts arena, the disciples of his Sun and Moon Peak swish, except for the three disciples of the Heavenly Mansion, all gone.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Bai Jing's face turned pale as unbelievable voices came out.
<br><br>And it wasn't just Bai Jing, even the presiding elder panicked.
<br><br>The entire peak's newly promoted disciples were all wiped out, this kind of thing, it was simply a big deal, but something that had never happened in the entire history of the Xuantian Sect.
<br><br>Even the Star Peak, at this moment want to mock, also become a little afraid.
<br><br>Because this matter is too big.
<br><br>Immediately, someone rushed to report to the upper levels of the sect. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Elder Bai, what should we do, what should we do about this matter?"
<br><br>Several elders of Sun Moon Peak were like ants on a hot pot, they simply did not know what to do.
<br><br>"Yes hundred elders, this matter is no longer under our control, or hurry to notify the peak master!" One of the elders said.
<br><br>"Fine, fine, I'll go notify the master right away."
<br><br>Bai Jing, who was also flustered, raised his step and ran towards the Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>But just two steps later, he stopped.
<br><br>Suddenly, he remembered Guo Shijie's warning to him when thirty disciples died last time.
<br><br>Anything, don't come to bother him.
<br><br>He remembered Guo Shijie's eyes when he said that.
<br><br>As Guo Shijie's disciple, he had no doubt that if he disturbed Guo Shijie's retreat again, he would not hesitate to take his life.
<br><br>He wiped a cold sweat and turned back.
<br><br>"Elder Bai, what are you doing?"
<br><br>The others turned their anxious eyes over.
<br><br>"Master explained that he is in seclusion, no one, no matter what, must not disturb him, last time I was heavily punished by him because of this, this time if I disturb him again, with Master's character, I'm afraid he will kill him!" Bai Jing said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"But, but this matter ......"
<br><br>"No need to but, the matter of the master, more important than anything else!"
<br><br>Hundred Jing sunken out: "Now that the master is not here, we just have to find out, what happened, while waiting for the arrival of the patriarch and others."
<br><br>"Okay, all right!"
<br><br>The others saw this and had no choice but to give up.
<br><br>The crowd was talking and guessing what was going on while waiting for the clan's top brass to arrive.
<br><br>Also at the same time.
<br><br>In the Sun and Moon Peak.
<br><br>The door of the secret room burst open.
<br><br>Guo Shijie walked out in a spirited manner.
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"I didn't expect it, I didn't expect it, this time I broke the cocoon and was reborn, I was blessed by the disaster, not only did I recover most of my injuries, there might be a possibility of refinement in my cultivation!"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>Guo Shijie's face was full of red light as he looked towards the martial arts arena at the bottom of the mountain.
<br><br>"I don't know how this big competition is going."
<br><br>"My Sun Moon Peak's disciples should firmly hold on to the top ten, right?"
<br><br>"And that little bastard Yi Feng, should also have met the king of hell long ago!"
<br><br>"Since that's the case, then this peak master will go and take a look!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie stepped up into the air and flew towards the martial arts arena at the bottom of the mountain.
<br><br>Bai Jing and the others who were anxiously waiting for the sect's top brass to arrive, now saw Guo Shijie flying in, and their eyes lit up as they hurriedly greeted him.
<br><br>"Master, you have finally come out of the gate!"
<br><br>Bai Jing tears came out in a hurry and rushed over.
<br><br>"Ah, Bai Jing ah!"
<br><br>"How's it going, is our Sun Moon Peak firmly in the top ten?"
<br><br>"And that pussy kid Yi Feng, should be gone too, right?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie held his head high and asked leisurely.
<br><br>Bai Jing already did not know how to speak, once heard Guo Shijie so asked, a time bitter face more do not know how to say.
<br><br>"Master, out, something happened."
<br><br>Long long long long, he only stifled his voice.
<br><br>Others are also a sad face, lowering the brain half dare not say a word.
<br><br>"Something has happened?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie frowned and asked, "What happened?"
<br><br>You look at me, I look at you, just no one dares to speak, or Bai Jing finally added, "Master, you better go over there yourself to see!"
<br><br>At that, Guo Shijie glared at them viciously.
<br><br>"Hmph, look at you all, one by one, either my Sun Moon Peak elders, or my Guo Shijie's disciples, not just a little thing, what can be a big deal? Just a little thing and you're all so confused.
<br><br>After saying that, Guo Shijie slowly walked towards the martial arts arena, and then cast his careless gaze overhead.
<br><br>This glance.
<br><br>It directly made him spit out a mouthful of old blood.
<br><br>"Where are the people?"
<br><br>"Where are the people of my Sun Moon Peak?"
<br><br>He hissed out, while looking around in an attempt to find the disciples.
<br><br>But there wasn't a single bubble.
<br><br>He came to Bai Jing in front of him with a long leap, grabbed him by the lapels and shouted coldly, "Tell me, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Sovereign, rest in anger, rest in anger."
<br><br>Bai Jing hurriedly begged for mercy.
<br><br>"I rest my anger you paralyzed."
<br><br>Guo Shijie smacked a big ear on Bai Jing's face and asked again in anger, "I am asking you, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Master, I, I don't know either!" Bai Jing shouted with a bitter face.
<br><br>"Then I am asking you again, when did this happen?" Guo Shijie asked through gritted teeth.
<br><br>"Enlightened Master, there, there was a while ago!"
<br><br>Bai Jing covered his face and said.
<br><br>"It's been a while?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Guo Shijie became even angrier and drank, "Then why didn't you tell me about this matter earlier?"
<br><br>"Master, yes, it was you who said last time that you were in seclusion and nothing was allowed to disturb you!" Bai Jing said with a sobbing face.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"You are simply angry with me!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie smacked another ear on Bai Jing's face, while a mouthful of old blood spurted out, directly old injuries recurred, standing in place and shaking to pieces.
<br><br>"Peak master, master ......"
<br><br>The crowd rushed to help.
<br><br>"All get out of my way, I want to find the patriarch!"
<br><br>As soon as he pushed the crowd away, he rushed towards to head towards the inner gate.
<br><br>"No need to look for it, I already know the matter."
<br><br>Along with a flood bell voice came out, the clan master Sima Zhen with a dozen elders came stepping in the air.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The crowd of people in the martial arts arena without exception knelt on the ground.
<br><br>"Greetings to the patriarch, the elders."
<br><br>"No need to be polite, get up!"
<br><br>Sima Zhen dragged his palm, and a soft force gently lifted up all the disciples present.
<br><br>"Patriarch, what is going on, so many disciples of my Sun Moon Peak, how can they all, you must help me find out." Guo Shijie cried out.
<br><br>"Although I do not know the specific circumstances at that time, but just now I and the elders combined efforts through divination, but also probably found out the matter clearly." Sima Zhen said.
<br><br>"Have you found out clearly?"
<br><br>"Patriarch quickly tell me, what exactly is going on?" Guo Shijie asked anxiously.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>Everyone else in the room, also looked at Sikong Zhen.
<br><br>Sikong Zhen had a majestic look on his face.
<br><br>Tilting his head.
<br><br>Turned his gaze to Liu Yan.
<br><br>Slightly pensive, then spoke, "It's Star Peak, a disciple named Yi Feng."
