"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>"How could such an invisible suppression appear for no reason!"
<br><br>Song Ke was puzzled.
<br><br>At this moment, two figures slowly walked towards this side.
<br><br>"This ghost place, looks eerie, how come not a single beast is seen!" As they walked, Yi Feng emitted a breathless voice.
<br><br>"Yeah, it's a bit strange!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his small head, also full of doubts.
<br><br>"Forget it, go ahead and take a look, there was a big commotion over here just now, and I don't know if there are any big beasts!" Yi Feng said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Seeing that it was these two people, the killing intent in Song Ke's eyes rose straight up!
<br><br>He hadn't forgotten that these two people had killed all his men and extinguished one of his doppelgangers.
<br><br>But although he hated to pick the skin of these two people, the mysterious power that suppressed his cultivation was still there. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This invisible thing brought him a great sense of crisis, making him not dare to move.
<br><br>"Humph, human beings, let you go first, when I get rid of this suppressive power, I will come back to clean you up properly!"
<br><br>In the dark, Song Ke's eyes moved and silently dived down.
<br><br>Yi Feng took Zhong Qing around for a while, and did not see any beast that could let Zhong Qing practice.
<br><br>"Or that's it for today apprentice!" Yi Feng looked at the sky and said towards Zhong Qing: "Just find a place to spend the night nearby!"
<br><br>"Yes Master!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded, suddenly found something, quickly shouted: "Wow, master, there is a good big acacia tree here."
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng also looked over and was also immediately shocked.
<br><br>This acacia tree is indeed large, I'm afraid it would take dozens of people holding hands to enclose it, this other world is worthy of the other world ah, I'm afraid there is no such a large tree on the whole earth ah!
<br><br>"OK, just rest under this tree for the night, even if the rainstorm is not afraid!"
<br><br>After Yi Feng surveyed a circle, he took things out and set up a camp under the acacia tree.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>And in the hidden space, the whole time observing this scene, Li Shuhua and other people, suddenly reveal shocked gaze.
<br><br>These two were really brave in their art, actually spending the night under Song Ke's belly.
<br><br>What made them feel more shocked was that Song Ke, who was still aggressive, was not moving at the moment.
<br><br>Wouldn't that mean that even Song Ke, who had broken the Saint, was afraid of them?
<br><br>"So, should we go out now?" Someone asked.
<br><br>"I think it's better to wait and see what happens, not to mention here under Song Ke's nose, and these two we can't figure out what they are, in case a little conflict is not something we can fight!" Yang Tianyu said.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd nodded in agreement.
<br><br>But at this time, suddenly found under the tree Yi Feng looked towards them, and then also got up and came this way.
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Shuhua and the others' hearts snapped.
<br><br>"He, he can see us?"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu said in shock.
<br><br>"No, it's impossible, it's absolutely impossible, this concealment method forms a small space by itself, it's impossible for mere vision to see us through the spatial barrier." Li Shuhua shook his head and explained, "So he came this way, it should be a coincidence!"
<br><br>The crowd then breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>I'm afraid that just as Li Shuhua said, Yi Feng's coming over was a coincidence.
<br><br>But at that moment, Yi Feng suddenly sent a questioning voice towards them, "It's you guys again, are you squatting here like this, are you taking a collective shit?"
<br><br>What?
<br><br>The crowd was shocked and stared at first.
<br><br>Li Shuhua's old face was even reddened.
<br><br>It was obvious that their so-called concealment formation could not block Yi Feng's sight at all.
<br><br>And since the other party had seen through it, there was no need for them to pretend.
<br><br>The crowd's faces were embarrassed as they prepared to get up, while fearing that Yi Feng would blame them for hiding here with the suspicion of prying eyes, their mouths hurriedly explained in an apprehensive manner.
<br><br>"Senior, I, we ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng interrupted them with a wave of his hand and said with a smile, "It's okay, meeting is fate, are men do not need to be embarrassed, I came to ask you guys, there is paper, can you also give me a place to move?"
<br><br>The people's faces turned red.
<br><br>This kind of expert's mind, really hard to guess ah!
<br><br>"Well, it seems you guys are out of paper, so I'll put up with it." Yi Feng clamped the back of the stock, straightened up and walked back towards the camp, sat down and shouted towards them, "Come and sit down after pulling!"
<br><br>"What about us?"
<br><br>The people smiled and immediately showed their apprehension.
<br><br>For Yi Feng's invitation, they dare not ignore, but that place they really do not dare to go over.
<br><br>"Forget it, we can't run away even if we run now, with this senior's strength since he invited us over, I'm afraid he will guarantee our safety." Li Shuhua said through clenched teeth.
<br><br>The crowd deeply agreed, had to stiffen their heads, stepping on small steps, slowly moving towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>But although the heart guessed that Yi Feng will guarantee their safety, but the real action or no bottom.
<br><br>The closer to the tree, the more false footsteps will be.
<br><br>The cold sweat on the forehead also direct.
<br><br>Looking at their appearance, Yi Feng smiled and reminded: "You still have to pay attention to the squatting time ah, squatting for a long time not only numb legs, the key is also easy to grow hemorrhoids ah!"
