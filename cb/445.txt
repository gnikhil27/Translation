At this time, four streams of light flew through the sky.
<br><br>It was none other than the four Northern Sea Patriarchs.
<br><br>"I had wanted to collect a corpse for that old bastard Night Energy, and I couldn't even find the corpse, how strange!" Jian Hengtian said with a sigh.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The others also sighed.
<br><br>Although they do not have a deep friendship with Night Energy, but the North Sea continent suffered this great disaster, who can say for sure, today's Night Energy will not be the future of them.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian, how much chance do you think the one from the Green Ox Sect can have against that Bai Shanyi?" Liu Gu Yi couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Who knows."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and said, "That one from the Green Ox Sect, besides ignoring the formation in the First Line Valley back then, I've only seen it on his pot of snake soup, so who knows when he really gets into action."
<br><br>"And the strength of the white shallow one ......"
<br><br>Speaking of which, Jian Hengtian couldn't help but shiver. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Even now the human immortal realm he, in front of the white shallow one is like a mole seeing an elephant, small and inaccessible.
<br><br>"Forty-six!"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian added.
<br><br>"Who's four and who's six?"
<br><br>The three men couldn't help but ask nervously.
<br><br>"You guys, you know it by heart ......"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's voice paused and finished with a sigh.
<br><br>The three people looked dark.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>Who four who six they also know by heart.
<br><br>The one from the Qingniu clan also seems to be very strong in means, but compared to the white shallow a wave of the hand to make people ashes, I'm afraid it's still a bit worse, right?
<br><br>What's more.
<br><br>Bai Shanyi is not a person.
<br><br>She represents the entire White Sun True Palace!
<br><br>Who knows what kind of super experts she has hidden behind that.
<br><br>"Do we, the Northern Sea, have to be someone else's slave in the future?"
<br><br>Yun Tianlong said in a depressed mood.
<br><br>The others were silent, the atmosphere was gloomy, everyone's heart was suppressed unbearable.
<br><br>"Why don't we go and look for the one from the Green Ox Sect again?" Li Canghai said.
<br><br>"Forget it, there is no need to go to Qingniu clan again, people are not from the North Sea at all, why should they be involved in our North Sea's storm?"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi shook his head and said, "And people are still in the Qingniu clan is not certain, I'm afraid that as early as the first appearance of white shallow, has left the North Sea it ......"
<br><br>"All right, continue to look for the night can that old man, at least give him a corpse."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian eagle eyes sweeping around, can not help but say: "also do not know where this guy died, looking for so long have not found."
<br><br>"Night can this guy is also, too devilish, thought with the one of the Green Bull Sect familiar with everything will be fine, who knows white shallow one is not believe in evil, this is how it ended up." Li Canghai could not help but sigh.
<br><br>The rest of the people are also silent nod.
<br><br>Who said it is not.
<br><br>If the night can understand the change of mind, it would not have ended up with the body can not be found.
<br><br>"What are you four doing?"
<br><br>At that moment, a voice came from above their heads coldly.
<br><br>Hearing this voice, the four people immediately exploded.
<br><br>They hurriedly looked up and saw the father and daughter of Night Energy stepping in the void, looking down at them from above.
<br><br>"Night, night, night, night can, you you're not dead?"
<br><br>When they saw that it was really Night Energy, the four people's eyes, as if they had seen a ghost, were filled with disbelief.
<br><br>"Humph, why should I die?"
<br><br>Night Energy coldly snorted with an iron face.
<br><br>"But you guys, not, not hit by the soul suppressing nails, how come half of you are not doing anything?" Liu Gu Yi couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Humph, soul suppressing nails?"
<br><br>Night can face full of contempt, from the nose cold snort, snickered and said: "Zhen soul nail that pedestrian thing, what's the big deal?"
<br><br>"What a big deal!"
<br><br>The four people were frozen in place.
<br><br>The expressions were complicated and different.
<br><br>Before in the flying boat you night energy is not such ah, that miserable simply that called a magnificent.
<br><br>Now but forced gas rushed to the sky, the soul nail to the mouth became a pediatric general things?
<br><br>Night can.
<br><br>What in the end has experienced?
<br><br>Four people can not help but ponder.
<br><br>"The four of you are at least a master, don't look like you've never seen the world, a small soul nail only, make such a fuss!"
<br><br>Night can soberly lecture out, stroked his beard, then drank: "The old man still have things to do, no effort to chat with you guys, that's it."
<br><br>"Daughter, let's go."
<br><br>"Yes, father."
<br><br>After saying that, the two of them revealed their auras and disappeared in the blink of an eye at a speed that the four people could not see with their naked eyes.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>This scene caused a cry like a dried duck to come from the throats of the four people.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian even pointed in the direction they left and stammered and shouted, "Di Di Di Immortal ...... that guy is an Earth Immortal now."
<br><br>Several people's hearts could not calm down for a long time.
<br><br>They originally thought that the night can certainly die, and even think about helping him collect the corpse.
<br><br>But now, not only did nothing happen, but actually directly advanced a big realm?
<br><br>"They came in this direction." Liu Gu Yi looked to one side and said meaningfully.
<br><br>"The one from the Green Ox Sect!"
<br><br>The others instantly reacted.
<br><br>"That's the only explanation that makes sense." Liu Gu Yi said with a complicated expression, "It seems that we still underestimated the one from the Green Ox Sect, he was actually able to pull off the Soul Suppressing Nail from the two of them."
<br><br>"Then what do we do now?" Jian Hengtian was busy asking, "Let's go find that one?"
<br><br>"It's better to think about it!"
<br><br>Liu Gu waved his hand and said, "The soul suppressing nail was pulled out, Bai Shao Yi must also know, this two people's game, stand in line is very important ah!"
<br><br>Hearing this, the others also frowned deep in thought.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>This soul nail, is also considered a disguised game of the two experts.
<br><br>The one from the Green Ox Sect does not know, but Bai Shanyi, with her ruthless methods, is definitely not going to give up.
<br><br>If you let Bai Shanyi know that the four of them are close to the one of the Green Ox Sect, the future if the one of the Green Ox Sect is unbeatable, then they will suffer a catastrophe.
<br><br>If they were alone, now they can have such an expert of the Green Bull Sect and White Light One against each other, they will certainly not hesitate to follow the broad out.
<br><br>After all, no one wants to be a dog.
<br><br>But they still have a clan behind them, with hundreds of thousands of lives at stake.
<br><br>Therefore, they had to think about the clan behind them.
<br><br>This was no longer a personal chance for them, but a big gamble that concerned their four clans.
<br><br>"How do I choose?"
<br><br>The four looked at each other's eyes, hesitating.
<br><br>"Looking at the direction that Night Energy left, it should be going to Baier City, let's follow Night Energy first and see what happens!" Ryuguichi said.
<br><br>The rest of the people nodded their heads.
<br><br>Now it seems that this is the only way to go.
<br><br>The four people quickly rushed to Baier City.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>In Baier City, the four found traces of Night Energy and were heading towards Mai's house on foot.
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>A sharp whistling sound came from the sky, accompanied by a stream of light, a golden flying boat, was already hovering over Baier City.
<br><br>"Bai Shao Yi, what is she doing here?"
<br><br>The four people's faces changed greatly, tightly frowned, for some reason, seeing this woman, they had a feeling of alarm.
<br><br>The two father and daughter of Night Energy who were rushing towards Xiao Mai's home saw this and also frowned, and also hurriedly hid themselves.
<br><br>"Goddess, something unexpected has been found inside this small town that is guaranteed to be able to surprise you."
<br><br>An old man bent his head in front of Bai Shao and smiled with a rosy face.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"Then I would like to see what good things are."
<br><br>White shallow a light foot stepping in the air, like a celestial immortal, from the flying boat stepping in the air step by step down.
<br><br>This made many mortals who had not seen this scene agitated, with frenzied faces, clustered towards the place where Bai Asaichi landed.
<br><br>"Wow, heavenly fairy."
<br><br>"Is it really a fairy from heaven?"
<br><br>"We pay our respects to the fairy."
<br><br>"It would be great if the immortal could give me some chance."
<br><br>Countless people have kneeled down to the ground, revealing their devotion, greeting Bai Shao to the next mortal.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The immortal who made their hearts and souls frenzied, however, had a cold light in her eyes and a disgusted look on her face.
<br><br>Jade palm a wave, a pressure directly landed down.
<br><br>Almost instantly, these mortals were pressed flesh and blood separated, have burst open.
<br><br>The others saw this, and only then understood that this was not a fairy at all, but a truly great fierce person, which fled in the chaos accompanied by various screams.
<br><br>The three walked all the way through, the streets became empty.
<br><br>Finally, led by the old man, came to the door of a small store with a closed door.
<br><br>"It's right here."
<br><br>The old man smiled meaningfully, "After the door opens, it will be to your satisfaction, Goddess."
