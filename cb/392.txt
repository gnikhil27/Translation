Fist shadow as in the past that came and went quickly.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun flew towards the center point, and immediately drew a breath of cold air, a million miles around was directly hit by a punch into nothingness.
<br><br>The original piece of the ground had formed a deep, bottomless black hole, connected to a spatial rift.
<br><br>"Which one is the Lord of the Green Jade Immortal Continent?"
<br><br>Just then, an old man in the sky stepped into the air, while a rolling thunder voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"I am."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun raised his head to look at the old man, filled with scorn, because the moment this old man appeared, he actually pressed him a little breathless.
<br><br>It was definitely a superpower of the Immortal Realm!
<br><br>"I am an emissary of the Heaven's Immortal Hall, I have come to inquire about the matter of the Fist Shadow, there are some things I need to ask you, and I hope you will report truthfully." The old man looked at Su Xuanjun and said.
<br><br>"Greetings to the messenger, please ask the messenger."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun did not dare to be rude and answered in a hurry. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Just now, did you see the fist shadow appear with your own eyes?" The old man asked.
<br><br>"I saw it with my own eyes."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun answered.
<br><br>"Then with your strength, can you see any clues, or can you capture the breath and clues?" The old man asked.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's pupils shrank.
<br><br>The expression was filled with tangled hesitation.
<br><br>"Back to the messenger, can the late generation ask a question first?" Su Xuanjun asked.
<br><br>The old man looked a little unhappy, but still said, "You speak."
<br><br>"If the messenger is compared to the Fist Shadow Master, which one is stronger or weaker?" Su Xuanjun asked.
<br><br>"There is no harm in telling you."
<br><br>The old man shook his head and said in a deep voice: "This fist shadow broke the boundary and came, the strength has reached the realm of the heaven, and I, just a responsible for collecting clues, really fight I'm not qualified to participate in the battle, at least that group of old guys of the Immortal Hall personally out!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun heart a thud.
<br><br>This old man in front of him is already strong enough to make him a little breathless, but still not qualified to participate in the battle?
<br><br>Although he knew this punch was strong, but never thought it would be so strong!
<br><br>So he raised his head and laughed bitterly: "Since the messenger understands that this person is strong to this extent, with my strength how can I catch a clue about this person?"
<br><br>"That's just it, forgive you for saying so."
<br><br>The old man waved his hand, then checked around the black hole, and after some fruitless investigation, he rushed back towards the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>After the old man left, Su Xuanjun let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>The reason he did not say everything he knew, because the gods fight mortals suffer, no matter what the purpose of this person, he can be a little less tainted to save his life a little more certainty.
<br><br>After all, he Su Xuanjun is afraid that he has already offended this person, but just now in the Immortal River Continent did not make a move against him, indicating that it is not yet a situation that will kill him Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>But at this moment if he reveals his clues, that can not be guaranteed.
<br><br>As for the immortal world.
<br><br>He did not think the Immortal Realm could protect him.
<br><br>After returning, Su Xuanjun went into seclusion and never appeared again.
<br><br>And at this moment.
<br><br>The Immortal River Continent was also very busy.
<br><br>The just-closed iceberg cracked open once again, the rolling molten lava tumbled once again, and in the desolation, in the dense forest, in the black sea, countless breaths scurried up into the space of the Immortal River Continent and hovered together ......
<br><br>"Tsk, long time no see, gentlemen ......"
<br><br>A breath bubbling with cold ice, coalesced into a giant face, and a meaningful voice came out.
<br><br>"Nian, we're not here to catch up with you, I've come to ask which one of you actually threw that punch just now." Another giant face asked icily.
<br><br>"I'm afraid that none of us can punch it out, right?" Another giant face coalesced out and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Could it be you humans?" The giant iceberg face asked soberly.
<br><br>"Giggle, I didn't expect you to be brainless back then, but now you are still so brainless?" A stunningly beautiful human woman stomped on the void and emitted a disdainful voice.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>A cold cry, ice fog swept out and swept towards the human woman.
<br><br>"Carved insects and small skills."
<br><br>The human woman's jade palm raised, thick fluctuations impacted out, and then collided with the ice fog together.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>Space ripped open and turned into a black hole of nothingness.
<br><br>"Enough of you."
<br><br>Impatient voices came from the rest of the breath.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the human woman and the giant iceberg face only each gave a cold snort and stepped back away.
<br><br>"Let's all calm down a little, this punch, it should be someone else." A ball of flame condensed a hideous face and opened its mouth, "Moreover, he should have awakened earlier than all of us!"
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>The crowd turned their eyes to him.
<br><br>"Actually, there's no need to even pretend, we all know by heart what this punch means." The flaming giant face glanced at the crowd and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>The crowd looked at each other's eyes and were silent.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>Everyone understood something in their hearts.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"Everyone knows that the time of the New Era did not arrive, but someone brought the power of the Immortal Realm into the Immortal River Continent ahead of time to advance the time of the Era, and we, as a result, awakened ahead of time."
<br><br>"If my guess is right, when we awakened, it was also because of such a fist!"
<br><br>The flaming giant face said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Yes, after this punch just now, I can feel that more power from the Immortal Realm has been lost to our Immortal River Continent!"
<br><br>A clump of earth mist coalesced and rose, also forming a face, and a voice of approval came out, then said, "So the purpose of this punch is obviously to awaken more people!"
<br><br>"Good, I can feel that this Immortal River Continent has awakened many more people, besides us, I also feel many powerful auras, only they are hiding very stealthily." The ice fog giant face said in a deep voice: "I'm sure that after this time, there will be more people awakened!"
<br><br>The crowd nodded intensely.
<br><br>The atmosphere, too, suddenly froze up.
<br><br>This matter, like a thorn in their hearts, can vaguely feel, this person with a pair of invisible hands, behind the control of what ......
<br><br>As if they, are all in the bureau ......
<br><br>What makes them gaze is that they clearly feel the presence of this fist, but they can not find the source point.
<br><br>Therefore, it is also impossible to find out who this person really is.
<br><br>What's more, there is no way to guess, what exactly is his purpose.
<br><br>Anyway ......
<br><br>The water in this Immortal River Continent is getting more and more muddled.
