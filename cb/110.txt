"Everyone, the capture of the demon emperor is a matter of great importance, let's take an idea!"
<br><br>The leopard king stood in the center and presided over the whole situation and said.
<br><br>"From the information conveyed by the night wind demon spirit, this human should be stronger than the demon emperor, but should not be much stronger." The Eagle King pondered, "Otherwise, the Night Wind Demon Spirit would not have the ability to fight him for 300 rounds."
<br><br>"Good, the Eagle King is right."
<br><br>Monkey King came out and said, "But even so, this person's strength is not something we can deal with, and I'm more curious about why he has to make the extra effort to capture the demon emperor, and even stew to drink ......"
<br><br>The crowd also similarly gaze at the head, this person's purpose in the end is what?
<br><br>For a time, the atmosphere fell into silence.
<br><br>Finally, the pig king came out and said: "He took the demon emperor, also said to stew soup, this move undoubtedly has a great element of humiliation, plus humans have always had hatred for my demon world, so his move is likely to be a deliberate provocation, or even a declaration of war on my Shogun Mountain range of demons!"
<br><br>"Not bad, but it is also possible that he is here to seek revenge." The deer king interjected: "For the usual human into the mountain, you should more or less eat a few, the demon emperor over the years, not to mention, I think it is likely to be eaten inside these people, then there is this person's descendants or disciples."
<br><br>"The deer king has a point." The Monkey King said, "Humans have always been vengeful, about what to treat others in the same way as others, which just fits his purpose of the demon emperor stew."
<br><br>"Everyone guessed these two reasons I see eight or nine." The Leopard King nodded and said, "But no matter what, we can't save the Demon Emperor alone, so it's better to take a specific note!"
<br><br>"I think, no matter what the reason is, this human's move is a declaration of war against all the demons in our Shade Mountain Range." The Eagle King said in a deep voice: "And humans are our common enemy in the demon world, he has provoked like this, we can completely report this matter to the demon emperors of several other territories and ask them for help."
<br><br>"I agree."
<br><br>"I also agree."
<br><br>"Although there is friction between several of our territories from time to time, but in front of a common enemy in the face of great right and wrong, I think they will put aside their prejudices for the time being."
<br><br>The other Demon Kings also nodded their heads at this moment.
<br><br>After taking note, the eighteen demon kings turned into streams of light and disappeared far away.
<br><br>Within a short day, the eighteen demon kings contacted the demon emperors of the other territories of the Shifu Mountain.
<br><br>As expected, when facing the common enemy of humans, the other demon emperors chose to put aside their usual grudges and came to their aid.
<br><br>With an order from several demon emperors, the demon beasts of the entire Makufu Mountain Range united and issued a kill order!
<br><br>Once the extermination order was issued, the entire Makufu Mountain Range set off a great earthquake, countless ordinary animals were thrown into panic, and the demonic beasts that usually hid in the shadows and did not come out of the world also came out of the mountains.
<br><br>In the mountain range.
<br><br>"This cloud road flower is really hard to find!"
<br><br>Yi Feng continued walking while carrying a large kingpin and a small bamboo basket on his back.
<br><br>"It seems to be fucking lost!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the map in his hand with a black face, filled with anger, he walked in this mountain range for a long half day, never went out, could not help but curse, "Fucking treacherous merchant, got me a fake map, I curse you for giving birth to a son without a fart!"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"There seems to be quite a few people ahead?"
<br><br>Just when he didn't know what to do, Yi Feng saw that there were quite a few people gathered in front of him halfway up the mountain, and immediately his eyes lit up.
<br><br>"I don't know what these people are doing, but they should know the way, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng carried Wang Ba, and with quick steps, he walked towards these people.
<br><br>"Stop, whou are You?"
<br><br>However, just as Yi Feng approached, two sword-wielding youths swept in and stopped in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Cultivators?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised, but he quickly calmed down and said with a smile, "Hello, I'm here to ask for directions, do you know how to get out of this mountain range?"
<br><br>"No, get lost!"
<br><br>The two youths bellowed without the slightest bit of politeness.
<br><br>"This doesn't have to be like this, right?" Yi Feng frowned and said, "Aren't I just asking for directions?"
<br><br>"A little mortal, how dare you talk back?!"
<br><br>The two youths' faces were furious, and the long swords in their hands came out at once, pushing straight at Yi Feng.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng directly frown, the same are cultivators, how the gap is so big, like their nearby Castle Peak Gate, it seems that the rules are very good.
<br><br>"Stop."
<br><br>Just then, a beautiful voice came, directly stopping the two youths.
<br><br>"Miss Li!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the two youths hurriedly stepped back and bowed, their eyes showing admiration for the ground and a hint of respect at the same time.
<br><br>Yi Feng also looked over, there was a 28 year old woman.
<br><br>She has a white dress, outlining a beautiful figure, bright eyes and white teeth, three thousand green silk draped behind the shoulders, long jade hand lightly holding the green blade, beautiful eyebrows frowning, giving people a cold and majestic.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The woman asked in a cold voice.
<br><br>"To inform you, Miss Li, We do not know where this idiot mortal came to disturb you miss, we will drive him away." The two youths said in a hurry and wanted to drive away.
<br><br>However, the woman waved her jade hand.
<br><br>The two youths looked puzzled, but did not dare to question.
<br><br>The woman's bright beautiful eyes looked at Yi Feng, looking up and down, the bamboo basket behind her back, the Wang Biao in her hand, plus the unrestrained breath all told her that this was indeed a mortal!
<br><br>Can't help but, she put down her guard, said without emotion: "What do you want?"
<br><br>Although this woman was cold and icy, she felt quite reasonable, so Yi Feng said politely, "Miss, I just want to ask for directions, how to get out of this mountain?"
<br><br>"Ask for directions?"
<br><br>The woman's pretty eyebrows frowned slightly and said coldly: "The uninformed are fearless, you dare to trespass in this mountain!"
<br><br>After saying that, she turned around and left, but at the same time, she sent out a smile.
<br><br>"You two send him down the mountain, make sure you do, or he won't survive in this mountain."
<br><br>"Thanks a lot, Miss."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng politely said thanks.
<br><br>But she did not have another response, Qian Qian jade hands gathered up the snow-white long skirt, seated on the ground and kneeling down, slowly closed those bright eyes.
<br><br>The two youths led Yi Feng towards the mountain, but just a short distance away, the two youths turned around and left.
<br><br>"Eh, two old brothers, why is this?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the two men in bewilderment, this has not gone out yet.
<br><br>"Humph, boy you know enough, if not for the face of Miss Li, you a small mortal I do not want to talk to you, and you do not go down the mountain, dead or alive and what does it matter to us?" A young man said disdainfully.
<br><br>"That's right, a mortal is just a cheap life, it's not enough to die!"
<br><br>The other youth also sent out a mocking voice, then the two swept up high and left quickly, obviously not wanting to care about Yi Feng's death or life.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng pinched his nose, did not care, two lives have long had a good state of mind, continue to move forward to find the way.
<br><br>He could not understand why the woman said that this place is dangerous?
<br><br>Just some occational beasts here and there, isn't that all...
<br><br>Perhaps.
<br><br>It's the cultivator's nerves are more nervous!
<br><br>"Sent down the mountain?"
<br><br>After the two youths rushed back, the woman sitting on her knees slowly opened her eyes and asked expressionlessly.
<br><br>"Sent, sent out."
<br><br>The two youths looked at each other, lowered their heads and said in an unspoken manner.
<br><br>The woman glanced at them and continued to close her eyes.
<br><br>However, the next moment, she felt a sense of absolute crisis hit her, before she had time to react, the dense demonic Qi erupted in the surrounding air.
<br><br>With a shadow coming from the ground, a huge eagle unfolded its sharp claws and attacked, accompanied by a voice full of killing intent.
<br><br>"All humans in the mountain range, no one will be left behind!"
