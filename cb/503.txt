"Old Four, Old Five, get out of here."
<br><br>"Leave us alone, he can't kill us!"
<br><br>Burial One shouted.
<br><br>Even though the brothers had gotten very unhappy over the matter of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Burial One and the three of them still thought about Burial Four and Burial Five.
<br><br>Perhaps because of the Heaven and Earth Number, Fang Xiaotian could not pose a threat to their lives at all, but they did not want Burying Four and Burying Five to take such a risk, and they did not want the two to encounter the risk of having their qi deprived.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What the three did not expect was that Burying Five actually rushed towards Fang Xiaotian alone.
<br><br>And Bury Four was rushing towards them.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, are you all right?"
<br><br>Burial Four hurriedly picked up the three of them and asked worriedly.
<br><br>"Old Fourth, don't mind us, go and help your Fifth Brother retreat back, this Fang Xiaotian is very strong, something will happen to Old Fifth." Burial One hurriedly shouted towards Burial Four. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Big brother is worrying too much."
<br><br>Burial Four laughed with a relaxed face, "Fifth brother will be able to deal with him."
<br><br>"What nonsense are you talking about, Fang Xiaotian is a Golden Immortal! What will Old Fifth take against him?" Burial Big shouted.
<br><br>"Heh, what's the big deal about a Golden Immortal, fifth brother is still a Xuan Immortal." Burial Four said unconcernedly.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Xuan Xian?"
<br><br>"You're saying that Old Fifth is a Xuan Xian?"
<br><br>"Are you out of your mind, old fourth?"
<br><br>"How can Old Five be a Xuan Xian?"
<br><br>The three people stared at Burial Four, and voices of scolding came out.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as their voices fell, a miserable scream came from behind Burial Four.
<br><br>Then they saw that Burying Five had directly cut off one of Fang Xiaotian's arms with a single slash.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Burial One's three eyes stared straight up.
<br><br>The body straight shivered.
<br><br>"How can Old Five, how can he be so strong, Fang Xiaotian is a Golden Immortal, actually cut off a Golden Immortal's arm with one slash?"
<br><br>Burial One's mouth was big enough to contain an egg, and a shocked voice came out.
<br><br>"Golden Immortal so what, in our island even a square dance aunt is not as good as it, and I have long said, the strength of the old five long ago to Xuan Xian, the general Xuan Xian can also casually abuse, let alone a trash Ba Golden Immortal."
<br><br>Burial four skimmed his mouth, emitting a careless voice.
<br><br>That posture, as stinky as it can be.
<br><br>And at this moment, Fang Xiaotian, who had broken his arm, likewise stared at the Burying Five in front of him with a face full of fear.
<br><br>"You, how can you?"
<br><br>"Aren't you the oldest five of the Black African Five, aren't you the weakest, why, why would you exert such power?"
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian roared loudly.
<br><br>Thinking back to the slash just now, he still had palpitations, if he didn't have some life-preserving cards, I'm afraid this slash would have directly cost him his life.
<br><br>"Old Fourth, tell me quickly, what the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Burial One three people reacted and grabbed Burial Four, busy asking.
<br><br>"Big brother, Old Fifth can have such strength, of course it's because he joined the Heaven and Earth Sect!"
<br><br>Burial Four laughed, "I told you guys a long time ago, the Heaven and Earth Sect is more powerful than you can imagine, even that what Immortal River Chaos Tablet is not worth mentioning in front of the Heaven and Earth Sect."
<br><br>"Heaven and Earth Gate."
<br><br>"Heaven and Earth Gate is really that powerful ......"
<br><br>The three men looked at each other with their eyes, their mouths murmuring incredulously.
<br><br>Although they had always believed in their hearts that nothing could compare to the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, and it was hard to accept that the Heaven and Earth Gate, which they did not put in their eyes, was really so powerful, but at this moment, with the facts in front of them, they could not help but believe.
<br><br>You know, before the burial five is only the strength of the Heavenly Immortal.
<br><br>Still the weakest among the five of them.
<br><br>And now in just a month's time, he had grown to a Xuan Xian.
<br><br>This kind of speed could no longer be described as terrifying.
<br><br>"Old Fourth, what about you?"
<br><br>Burial One looked at Burial Four again and asked apprehensively, "You wouldn't have also reached Xuan Xian, right?"
<br><br>"I'm not." Burial Four laughed.
<br><br>"Oh, that's good."
<br><br>Burying One and the three of them breathed a sigh of relief, if Burying Four had also reached Xuan Xian, it would have been really scary.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They had just breathed a sigh of relief when Burying Four's cold voice continued, "Although I didn't make it to Xuan Xian because I entered the Heaven and Earth Gate so much later than Old Five, but that kind of trash Ba Jin Xian has no problem abusing ten thousand of them."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Burial four posture a pose.
<br><br>"Look, shoes, intermediate level immortal weapon."
<br><br>"Bell, top level immortal weapon."
<br><br>"Ring, high level immortal weapon."
<br><br>"And this, this knife, top-grade ......"
<br><br>"This, and this, also high grade ......"
<br><br>Burial Four introduced while displaying the full armament taken out from the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>A full dozen types of immortal weapons.
<br><br>A living mob.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>To the burial three three eyes are looking straight.
<br><br>"Old Four, you all these immortal weapons, are, where did they all come from?"
<br><br>The three gulped and asked shiveringly, "It can't all be the treasures you brought out from inside the Heaven and Earth Gate, right?"
<br><br>"Not bad, exactly the treasures brought out from inside the Heaven and Earth Gate."
<br><br>Burial Four laughed with his head held high.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>The three people drew a cold breath backwards.
<br><br>Nor did they expect that the Heaven and Earth Sect actually had so many treasures!
<br><br>This was really amazing.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, you guys don't listen to Old Four's blind bragging, this is no treasure, it's just a pile of trash."
<br><br>At this time, burial five came over and rolled his eyes at burial four and said.
<br><br>"Old Five, what do you mean, this is a bunch of fake goods?"
<br><br>Three people looked at Burial Five and asked.
<br><br>The heart was thinking the same thing.
<br><br>This full of more than ten pieces, how could they all be immortal weapons?
