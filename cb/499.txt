Burial Four left the chaos.
<br><br>Grabbing the Heaven and Earth Gate flyer that belonged to him, he flew all the way to follow the address.
<br><br>Two days later.
<br><br>Burying Four had arrived not far from the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>He took the jade slip in his hand and began to contact Burying Five.
<br><br>At this moment, Burying Five was digging out books in the Hidden Scripture Pavilion. Although he still hadn't found his dao, in just a month's time, his strength had grown tremendously.
<br><br>Moreover, the atmosphere of the Heaven and Earth Sect made him feel extremely good.
<br><br>There was never any rivalry, let alone any deceitfulness, for him, the later youngest brother, the brothers and sisters not only did not bully, opposed to him full of love.
<br><br>Occasionally the fourth elder brother Chi a bucket will give him a small stove, passing by the fourteenth elder brother Shen Nong's vegetable field, often pick him some melons to quench his thirst.
<br><br>And the seventh senior brother Jia Jia Qin, but also gave him a small chicken boy, I heard that raised to be able to turn into nine days phoenix, as a mount.
<br><br>"How nice!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Burial Five was full of excitement.
<br><br>Being able to seize the moment to come to the Heaven and Earth Gate in this life was simply the greatest decision he had ever made.
<br><br>Just at this moment, the sound transmission jade slip that he had put aside for a long time without using suddenly flashed brightly.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>"Fourth Brother?"
<br><br>"Fourth Brother is actually here?"
<br><br>Burial Five was overjoyed.
<br><br>He had long wanted to find a chance to go back and pull his brothers over, but he just hadn't had the time with his recent successive breakthroughs.
<br><br>Not long after that.
<br><br>The two met not far outside the island.
<br><br>Even though there was some unpleasantness before, the two people who were extremely close met for a big bear hug.
<br><br>"Fifth brother, do you know that big brother and the others are very worried about you." Burial Four said reproachfully, "So Fourth Brother is here this time to take you back, after all, the Immortal River Chaos Tablet will open in less than a year, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, don't miss it!"
<br><br>"Take me back?"
<br><br>Buried five hastily shook his head and said, "Fourth brother what are you talking about, I have already settled down here."
<br><br>"Settle down?"
<br><br>Burial four frowned and said in a deep voice: "Fifth brother, I know you have always been naive, but you must be able to distinguish between the advantages and disadvantages, huh?"
<br><br>"Fourth brother, it is because I can distinguish very clearly that I am not going back." Burial Five said solemnly.
<br><br>Burial Five shook his head helplessly.
<br><br>He really did not know what kind of compulsion Burial Five was under.
<br><br>Actually so a stick.
<br><br>Nowadays, what other chance is there, what place is better than to enlighten the Immortal River Chaos Tablet?
<br><br>"Fourth brother, I know you may not believe my words, but please come back to the Heaven and Earth Gate with me and take a look, then you will know why I made such a decision." Burial Five said solemnly.
<br><br>"Old five, listen to my brother, come back with me, you are still too young, many things you can not distinguish clearly." Burial Five said in a serious tone.
<br><br>"Fourth brother, still the same words, you go back with me to see, I believe will change your opinion!"
<br><br>Burial five eyes solemnly looked at burial four, once again passed out the voice.
<br><br>"It's just that."
<br><br>"I will go with you to take a look."
<br><br>Seeing Burial Five so insistent, Burial Four waved his hand and agreed.
<br><br>He also wanted to see what this Heaven and Earth Gate was hiding, and in the end, it had arranged a blindfold that could actually compel his fifth brother into such a state.
<br><br>Two people, walking towards the island.
<br><br>When the two arrived at the lake, a force of heaven and earth descended.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Burial Four immediately revealed a look of panic.
<br><br>Because he himself was in this space, his strength was greatly suppressed.
<br><br>Not right.
<br><br>To be precise, it was not suppression.
<br><br>Rather, the laws of heaven and earth in this surrounding space have changed.
<br><br>The space that could be torn apart with one's hands became incomparably solid, and the gravity also changed greatly, so that he, who could easily fly, was actually only able to pop up a foot in place.
<br><br>"Haha, fourth brother need not be alarmed, my entire Heaven and Earth Gate space has long been beyond the control of the Immortal River Continent, the degree of spatial solidity, I'm afraid, more powerful than the Immortal World, so even if the Immortal World experts come, at most can only be able to turn over a heel." Burial Five hurriedly explained with a smile.
<br><br>"Hmph, where am I alarmed, just a little uncomfortable just coming." Burial Four waved his hand and said with his head held high and full of concern.
<br><br>Although just now did scare him a little.
<br><br>But so what?
<br><br>After all, this place is a bit extraordinary, he buried four actually long ago guessed.
<br><br>Otherwise without half a thing, it would be impossible to fool his family's old five.
<br><br>As for this space ......
<br><br>Heh ......
<br><br>Immortal River Continent has experienced so many great breakups and has given birth to countless powerful people, so it is not surprising that such a small dimensional space has been preserved.
<br><br>Therefore, the fact that the Heaven and Earth Gate has such a piece of space does not prove how powerful it is.
<br><br>What can really show how powerful it is also depends on how many experts there are on this island.
<br><br>Just does this island look like it has a lot of experts?
<br><br>It really doesn't.
<br><br>Maybe there are.
<br><br>But I'm afraid there are not many of them.
<br><br>At least the buried four think so.
<br><br>He carelessly followed the burial five on the raft, slightly contemptuous glance at the boat.
<br><br>It is an old man.
<br><br>The old man.
<br><br>Also do not feel much strength, he casually glanced back to the head.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The old man, who looked old, suddenly burst into action, but directly let his eyes burst out.
<br><br>Only to see that the old man stood on the shore, first with a bamboo pole will be the raft away from the shore, and so the raft floated away from the shore with the current, the old man stood on the shore with both feet gently glare.
<br><br>This glare.
<br><br>He stared for three feet!
<br><br>Then landed safely on the raft, gently supported the raft floating toward the island.
<br><br>This moment, buried four by the old man next to the shocked straight shiver.
<br><br>"High, high high high expert ......"
<br><br>He stammered out his voice, shivering.
<br><br>He thinks he is not weak, but in this space, dawning jump up just a foot.
<br><br>And this old man a glare three feet, but also seems so lightly, is not a master of what?
<br><br>"Oh, young man need not be alarmed, the old boatman." The old man stroked his beard, faintly glanced at him, and laughed softly.
<br><br>Burial Four hurriedly and respectfully smiled at the old man.
<br><br>After laughing, he hurriedly pulled Burial Five aside and whispered, "Fifth Brother, why didn't you tell me that this person is so strong, you almost offended him just now."
<br><br>"Fourth brother, it's okay, relax and unwind." Burial five hurriedly comforted: "Slowly you will get used to it."
<br><br>"What slowly get used to, although I came to pull you back, but also do not want to offend the expert for no reason ah." Burial four face anxiously said.
<br><br>"Aiya fourth brother, it's really okay, the old man is very good at talking." Burial Five consoled evenly.
<br><br>After a few consolations from Burial Five, plus the old man did not seem to be angry, Burial Four's heart relaxed.
<br><br>After relaxing, Burial Four couldn't help but be curious again, "But Old Five, this old man is so powerful, he should be the top battle force of your Heaven and Earth Sect, right?"
<br><br>"At the very least, it's a Grand Elder level figure?"
