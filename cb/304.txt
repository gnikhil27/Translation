Hearing this voice, Yi Feng looked indescribably complicated.
<br><br>In this cultivation world, this kind of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting skills are not much use, but a few more skills will always give him some sense of accomplishment.
<br><br>But what sucks for him is the reward for the mount.
<br><br>What the hell is called slowly?
<br><br>The name does not feel like a good thing.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
<br><br>"Elder, what the hell is this?"
<br><br>And the goat-bearded old man finally couldn't help himself and was busy asking towards the monk.
<br><br>"The monk will always have the result if you study it well."
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha."
<br><br>The monk said with a smile. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Then he and Yi Feng left one after the other.
<br><br>The goat-bearded old man stood in place with a bewildered face, then hurriedly sat down towards the chessboard, his eyes carefully observing the game the two had just played.
<br><br>When he fixed his mind to look, he suddenly found that the entire chess game had turned into a river of stars.
<br><br>In the river of stars, the sky was full of stars.
<br><br>A black and a white power were intertwined.
<br><br>But it was clearly visible that the black power quickly took the upper hand, and then drove the white power to a corner, until it was finally completely swallowed.
<br><br>"This this this ......"
<br><br>"This is ......"
<br><br>"The power of the Great Dao?"
<br><br>The goat-bearded old man's heart secretly exclaimed, shivered violently, and his eyes flashed with thick incredulity.
<br><br>And he also suddenly remembered.
<br><br>Just now, the monk was holding the black son, and the mortal was holding the white son, didn't they correspond to the two forces in the star river?
<br><br>Then he realized that the youth he despised was not a mortal, but an even more powerful master than the monk!
<br><br>In front of him, I'm afraid I'm the real mortal!
<br><br>He shook his head with a bitter smile.
<br><br>He also never thought that he just wanted to take a disciple here, but blew up two such supreme master, and one is stronger than the other!
<br><br>"Just the immortal road has been broken, this kind of high person should not have appeared in this world ah ......"
<br><br>"This continent, I'm afraid the sky is about to change!"
<br><br>"Such a big event, must be notified down."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The chess game left behind is a heavenly opportunity for him.
<br><br>Can't help but, he bowed twice in the direction that Yi Feng and the monk left, as a sign of gratitude.
<br><br>On the street.
<br><br>Yi Feng caught up with the monk and asked with a smile, "By the way, haven't you asked the name of the master?"
<br><br>"Poor monk Chen Kunpeng, Dharma name Kunpeng."
<br><br>The monk showed a smile and folded his hands and said.
<br><br>"So it's Master Kunpeng, nice to meet you."
<br><br>Yi Feng likewise bowed his head with folded hands and borrowed it to say, "Right Master Kunpeng, just now that old man's inheritance you did not accept, and he also called you senior so respectfully, I guess you are also a cultivator, right?"
<br><br>"How dare you, monk, I am just a monk."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng smiled and responded, "He called me senior, but it is only because my chess skill is slightly higher than his."
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>In his heart, he had some admiration for this Kunpeng monk.
<br><br>Obviously can accept the mantle of cultivator, but choose not to, really is a high person also ......
<br><br>It is that he has no spiritual roots, otherwise with his chess skills, that old man can certainly pass on his mantle!
<br><br>What a pity.
<br><br>Otherwise, they cultivate cultivation, at the very least, they can mix to a martial spirit it!
<br><br>At this moment, Monk Kunpeng suddenly took a step.
<br><br>Turning around, he smiled and said towards Yi Feng, "Shih-mei, let's say goodbye for now today, it's almost time for me to go and make a fate."
<br><br>Saying that, he walked towards the restaurant next to him.
<br><br>But Yi Feng fixed his eyes and took a look.
<br><br>But he was taken aback.
<br><br>"Yi Hong Yuan?"
<br><br>He couldn't help but shout, "Master Kunpeng, you're going here to make a fate?"
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng looked up at the plaque and smiled gently, "There is no need to be alarmed, all is fate, and in the eyes of the poor monk, all beings are equal, all are benefactors."
<br><br>"Since all are fated, where is it not fated?"
<br><br>"So the benefactor will meet again, of course with our fate I believe that we will meet again in the future."
<br><br>After saying that, he smiled with a face full of greatness and then swaggered into the Yihong courtyard.
<br><br>"High man."
<br><br>"This is the high man who has truly transcended the world."
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but give a thumbs up, and then led Zhong Qing away ......
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>The master and disciple rushed back to the land of chaos.
<br><br>And remembering the matter of Skeleton Ben Wei grabbing the embroidered ball, Yi Feng felt a big head.
<br><br>Especially when he heard that the woman's wedding are ready and will come to pick up tomorrow, Yi Feng finally could not sit still.
<br><br>So, he wanted to play a few more days on this side of the Deserted Trail, and took Bones Ben Wei to run away overnight.
<br><br>Others do not know what Bone Ben Wei is a thing, he is still not clear?
<br><br>So this marriage simply can not be married.
<br><br>If the woman knows that the embroidered ball is a skeleton, not to mention will not scare people, and perhaps will be tied up in anger them all.
<br><br>"You say you what kind of yourself no forced number, you a broken thing also ran to grab the embroidery ball, which is not a clear pit others?"
<br><br>In the darkness of the night, Yi Feng pulled the skeleton Ben Wei while lecturing.
<br><br>"Aba, I'm not going."
<br><br>However, the skeleton Ben Wei but clinging to a tree, no matter how Yi Feng pulled refused to go.
<br><br>"You do not go you stay why?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I want to be married, I want love."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei clung to the tree and said firmly.
<br><br>"Becoming a bride?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Yi Feng directly fire, directly a large ear melon pumped over.
<br><br>"You dog, you still become a marriage, but also fucking want love?"
<br><br>"You robbed others embroidery ball already pitted others bad enough, you still want to marry others and ruin their reputation?"
<br><br>Yi Feng angry seven orifices smoke, grabbed the skeleton Ben Wei's arm word by word lecture.
<br><br>"No, I want it."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei used the most abject tone and said the most firm words.
<br><br>After saying that, he also did not forget to shrink his head.
