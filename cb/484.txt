Xiao Zhan lowered his head, his face showing a difficult look.
<br><br>Although the feeling in his heart was strong that these senior brothers and sisters might be very powerful.
<br><br>But, after all, he had not seen it!
<br><br>So to be honest, he really didn't have the strength in his heart!
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>How could he, a trash who could not cultivate, defeat a human immortal realm, but rather Liu Ruyan, who had many cards, within three days?
<br><br>This kind of disparity, too big.
<br><br>So big that after he calmed down, he didn't even dare to imagine.
<br><br>Unable to help himself, he also turned his gaze towards Su Yunyun and asked naggingly, "Senior sister, may I ask in three days' time, do you really have a way for me, for me to defeat Liu Ruyan?"
<br><br>"Senior brother, why worry, senior has already thought of it for you." Su Yun Yun said softly, "Before Master left, he gave me this book, and specially cautioned me to let you read more of this book and feel the main character of this book."
<br><br>Said. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Su Yunyun storage ring a move.
<br><br>A book "Dou Qi Hua Ma" appeared in his hand.
<br><br>"A book given by the master?"
<br><br>Looking at this book, Xiao Zhan couldn't help but ask, "Then how am I supposed to manipulate this book, or is this book a powerful martial art?"
<br><br>"But, with my current appearance, even if it is a powerful martial pole, it is simply impossible for me to learn it in three days!"
<br><br>"Exactly how to use it, senior brother will know at a glance." Su Yun Yun said with a faint smile.
<br><br>"Okay, fine."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan half-heartedly put the book in his hand, looked at the four words of Dou Qi into horse on the top of the book help, and then slowly turned it over.
<br><br>On the other hand, Xiao Yun on the side was not holding any hope anymore, sighing helplessly, his face filled with disillusionment.
<br><br>A book.
<br><br>How could it help his son defeat the Human Immortal realm's Liu Ruyan within three days with no cultivation?
<br><br>He only hoped now that his son, who could withstand the blow after three days, would still be strong enough to live.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>However, hanging his head in despair, a thunderous laughter suddenly exploded next to his ears.
<br><br>The head turned to look, found that it is the son next to read a book out, while laughing also while roaring, the body also a trembling.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"Good one thirty years of the river east and west, good one Mo deceive the youth poor, I enlightened, I completely enlightened."
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Xiao Yun heart a thud.
<br><br>Could it be that this son of his, who could not bear too much pressure, had gone piggy-back crazy?
<br><br>But just as he thought this, a monstrous aura burst out violently from Xiao Zhan's body.
<br><br>He stared at the side and looked at it.
<br><br>Then he found that his waste son, who did not have any strength, the realm with the flying boat generally elevated.
<br><br>Martial Master ......
<br><br>Martial Emperor ......
<br><br>Martial Sovereign ......
<br><br>Martial Saint ......
<br><br>Human Immortal ......
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Xiao Yun's legs clamped together, his mouth opened and a cry like a dry duck came out.
<br><br>Stand on the ground and become an immortal?
<br><br>His waste son actually became immortal on the ground?
<br><br>The scene in front of him hit Xiao Yun's mind, like an explosive thunder resounding in his mind.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan's realm didn't stop after reaching Human Immortal, but continued to rise like crazy ......
<br><br>Human Immortal ......
<br><br>Earth Immortal ......
<br><br>Heavenly Immortal ......
<br><br>It was only when he finally climbed to Golden Immortal that it sort of stopped.
<br><br>And in the midst of his promotion, all kinds of energy surged wildly in his body in agitation, and everything in the room was completely cut into pieces.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>Also dark clouds, all kinds of robbery clouds began to condense and come.
<br><br>At the critical moment, Su Yun Yun's jade hand waved to completely shield and isolate Xiao Zhan within a space, which made the heavenly clouds disappear and did not cause a major impact.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Xiao Yun's mouth was enough to shout down an egg, his heart had long been flooded with shocking waves, and he could no longer use words to express his inner feelings.
<br><br>"Ugh."
<br><br>"Twenty-eight senior brother has only actually been promoted to Heavenly Immortal because he hasn't cultivated for too long, it's a bit of a pity." Li Jin could not help but sigh with regret when he saw the breath that had stopped coming off of Xiao Zhan's body.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This cold remark of his made Xiao Yun, who had just taken a breath, almost didn't jerk over.
<br><br>What do you mean you've only been promoted to Heavenly Immortal?
<br><br>These words, what a fucking pretender!
<br><br>The disheveled look on Xiao Zhan's face was swept away, and feeling the powerful strength that had never been seen in his body, his face was filled with unprecedented confidence.
<br><br>"Xiao Zhan, thank you, senior brother and senior sister."
<br><br>He hurriedly knelt down and looked at Su Yun Yun and the others with a grateful face.
<br><br>"Senior brother, why do you need to be like this."
<br><br>"Ever since you joined the Heaven and Earth Sect, we are family." Su Yun Yun's jade hand moved and gently lifted Xiao Zhan up as she said solemnly, "Moreover, all of this is because of Master's command."
<br><br>"Yes, it's all because of Master ......"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan couldn't help but think of the main character inside the Dou Qi Transformation Horse.
<br><br>He, didn't he suffer from the same thing as himself?
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>The master had already counted on his own encounter, which gave himself such a book ah!
<br><br>"For me, Xiao Zhan, to be able to join the Heaven and Earth Sect is really a blessing from my past life."
<br><br>"I swear that I, Xiao Zhan, will do my duty for the Heaven and Earth Sect and honor my master forever!"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Xiao Zhan couldn't help but think of the youth who was lying on a recliner, catching up on dramas every day, with a strong look of reverence revealed in his eyes.
<br><br>And aside.
<br><br>Xiao Yun, who had slowed down, was also wetting his old face with tears.
<br><br>"Really old ancestor blessing ah!"
<br><br>Xiao Yun was in tears, never imagining that his son could really have his time come and join a mysterious and powerful sect.
<br><br>Especially the mysterious master they talked about, with a single book, he made his waste son, who was unable to cultivate, directly become a Golden Immortal realm, how terrifying as a cultivation should that be!
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder these people in front of you so will not put the Heavenly Spirit Sect in the eyes, open and shut the mouth to destroy.
<br><br>The funny thing is, he didn't believe it at first, thinking they were bragging.
<br><br>Now it seems that it was entirely his short-sightedness.
<br><br>And now that his son has a Golden Immortal cultivation, what bird hair Liu Ruyan still needs to put in his eyes?
<br><br>"Son, in three days, father will accompany you on a trip to the Heavenly Spirit Sect, let that Liu family, let that Heavenly Spirit Sect take a good look, a twenty-year-old Human Immortal is nothing!"
<br><br>"My son, Xiao Zhan, is the one who has the qualifications of a great emperor."
<br><br>"I'm really looking forward to seeing what that woman's expression will be when she finds out that the one she has withdrawn from is a twenty-year-old Golden Immortal."
<br><br>Xiao Yun said in a spirited manner.
