After the martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on a stool, bored as he watched Wu Yonghong's three people work while having a casual conversation.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow!"
<br><br>This is, lying at Yi Feng's feet of the dog, sneezed several times.
<br><br>"Dog sneezing to rain!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed slightly, subconsciously said a proverb from his previous life, then got up and walked into the martial arts school, and found a broken umbrella from a pile of rags.
<br><br>"This umbrella, you three keep it first, in case it really rains also be able to respond to emergency!" Yi Feng threw this umbrella to the three working Wu Yonghong.
<br><br>"Sir!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people immediately looked at Yi Feng with shock.
<br><br>If they remembered correctly, this umbrella was the imperial treasure left by Ning Xuanwu that day, and it was also one of the treasures of his Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>Just like that, thrown to them? Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Sir, it's not too good to give us such a valuable thing just like that, right?" Wu Yonghong said with embarrassment.
<br><br>"Precious thing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed helplessly: "What kind of valuable thing is this, it's just a broken umbrella, you help me work, it's raining and the umbrella should be emergency what?"
<br><br>"Just a broken umbrella?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong's heart was shocked.
<br><br>This is at least an imperial grade treasure, although they also have a few pieces, but usually used for the bottom of the box things, but in the eyes of Mr. so even worse than rags?
<br><br>But think about it, even the hoes and shovels they use in their hands are Saint-class things, the royal things in the eyes of Mr., I'm afraid it is really nothing.
<br><br>However, I don't know if it's because the proverb is really that accurate, the sky is indeed getting darker.
<br><br>It seems that it is about to rain.
<br><br>Although he was well aware that Mr.'s methods could turn the clouds into rain, but remembering the situation when Mr. entered the mortal world to understand life, so Wu Yonghong couldn't help but ask: "Just that Mr. gave us the umbrella, what do you use yourself?"
<br><br>"Me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed, these old men are really cute.
<br><br>A broken umbrella is still polite, he really need to use the umbrella, just go to any place to buy one, right?
<br><br>So, he smiled at the old men and said, "You don't have to worry about me, there will be umbrellas when you really need them."
<br><br>"There will be one naturally?"
<br><br>Several old men looked at each other, feeling that there was some deep meaning in the words of the gentleman.
<br><br>However, they felt that it was too profound to speculate.
<br><br>Therefore, they didn't think any more, and with a slight hesitation, they took the umbrella.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>Several people respectfully thanked.
<br><br>Looked at the sky.
<br><br>Although the gloomy dark, but in this autumn also can not say, so Yi Feng also did not rush into the house, but will take out the guitar, also want to "zither" proficiency to improve a little.
<br><br>After all, if you are here, you can still chat with these old men in your spare time, and when you play well, you may be able to get some praise from these old men, which is much more comfortable than lying alone in the martial arts school against the wall.
<br><br>After thinking about it, a song from his previous life, "Farewell", was slowly played.
<br><br>As soon as Yi Feng's zither sound fell, several old men who were hoeing the ground trembled violently and hurriedly looked over with avid eyes.
<br><br>"Sir's zither sound."
<br><br>"It actually contains such strong zither intent!?"
<br><br>Several old men like Wu Yonghong stared, even those like them who knew nothing about the zither were able to feel the zither intent in this zither sound.
<br><br>At the same time, Lu Dasheng who was carrying dung also a sharp brake, not even caring that he almost fell into the dung pit, busy gaze over.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>Almost everyone put down the work in hand, not moving to look at Yi Feng, even gasping for breath are not afraid to loud, afraid to spoil the sound.
<br><br>After a long, long time ......
<br><br>The palm of Yi Feng's fluctuating strings only then came to a standstill.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people look back, cast a face full of respectful gaze, because they all just in the sound of the zither has a lot of insight, or state of mind, or gong methods ......
<br><br>It's really good to be here in Mr.!
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on a holy treasure, but you can also get other gifts from time to time.
<br><br>For example, the royal treasures ah, zither intent ah ......
<br><br>However, compared to the feelings of Wu Yonghong and others, Lu Dasheng almost shed tears.
<br><br>All work for Yi Feng, Wu Yonghong and their various benefits smashed to the hand, however, he did the most painful and tiring and dirty, so many days of carrying the dung, but still no half benefit.
<br><br>To today.
<br><br>He finally followed the mix to a little benefit.
<br><br>Finally sort of, there is a kind of keep the clouds open to see the moon, let people excited want to cry!
<br><br>"Sir's zither sound is really awe-inspiring, making us reminisce and can't help but immerse ourselves in it!"
<br><br>"Yes, it's simply a flood of blessings for us to listen to a song of Sir."
<br><br>At this time, Wu Yonghong and others couldn't help but pass out various admiring voices towards Yi Feng again.
<br><br>"Eh, calm down calm down."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, although he had no intention of showing it, but it was still pleasant to get others' approval for what he had played.
<br><br>"Ding: congratulations on the promotion of Qin to the world!"
<br><br>Just then, the system's voice came in his mind, making Yi Feng slightly happy.
<br><br>The emperor is not to blame, so many days of practice, finally is the promotion ah.
<br><br>Then catch the heat and have a few more songs, right?
<br><br>Yi Feng secretly said in his heart, at the same time thinking, what song should be played next.
<br><br>And at this time, the sky suddenly filled with a layer of thick demonic aura, at the same time, two breath thick figures, stepping in the air.
<br><br>Soon, they came to the sky above the martial arts school.
