Shadow Island.
<br><br>Around this small courtyard, many people were busy.
<br><br>Watering the flowers, hoeing the ground, busy that is called a happy, each person's eyes are flashing hope for the future.
<br><br>And Jiang Hong, who was responsible for watering the flowers, wiped a handful of fragrant sweat on her forehead and stood up, looking at the black sea from afar.
<br><br>Staying here for this period of time not only made the raging power in her body dissipate, but her cultivation realm also broke through from the original Reincarnation Immortal Realm to the True Element Immortal Realm.
<br><br>For some reason, a figure emerged in her mind.
<br><br>That was the Human Immortal youth she had come in contact with when she was first shut in.
<br><br>Although she had always scoffed at what this youth had said at the beginning, and even felt ridiculous, she had to say that that youth had actually caused a great impact on her heart, unknowingly influencing her.
<br><br>Because at one time she wanted to give up, she was influenced by this youth's optimistic mindset at first, which strengthened her determination to survive.
<br><br>If she hadn't persevered at the beginning, she wouldn't have come across Gong Chen at all, and even less would have had the chance to come here and obtain a heavenly chance.
<br><br>"It's just a pity, you died a long time ago, if you could also come here, I'm afraid that you would be able to get out as you wished, soon after." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Jiang Hong couldn't help but let out a long sigh.
<br><br>However, she also understood in her heart that this was only a luxury hope.
<br><br>Even if this Human Immortal did not die, I'm afraid that he would not be qualified to come here.
<br><br>After all, the minimum standard to come here was the Reincarnation Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Just then, a commotion came from inside the martial hall, and it was to see everyone with a look of excitement, hurrying towards the inside of the martial hall.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Jiang Hong asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"It's sir who has brought Gong Chen back, go pay your respects to sir!" An old man excitedly jumped straight in place while shouting at Jiang Hong.
<br><br>"That one has returned?"
<br><br>Jiang Hong's body trembled, and his heart was also greatly shocked.
<br><br>She had long admired this one's strength as well as his handiwork.
<br><br>But she had never seen this one in all the time she had been here, so she was always longing for this one to come back.
<br><br>And today.
<br><br>That one finally came back?
<br><br>As soon as she thought of this, she hurriedly put down the kettle in her hand and asked the old man, "Is there anything I should pay attention to when I see you?"
<br><br>She asked nervously.
<br><br>All the while, she straightened her clothes so that she would be in the best shape when she met that one.
<br><br>"Don't worry, you don't need to be so nervous, the gentleman is very easy-going." The old man laughed, "Come on in and pay your respects to the gentleman with us."
<br><br>After the old man finished speaking, he walked towards the martial arts school with his head down.
<br><br>Although she heard that the gentleman was very easy-going, Jiang Hong was still very nervous in her heart.
<br><br>She didn't dare to slacken off and also hurriedly followed the crowd with her head lowered towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>Of course she was more excited.
<br><br>Unknowingly, the crowd had arrived in the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>The crowd's neat voice came out.
<br><br>Jiang Hong also shouted out with the masses and saluted.
<br><br>But even though this one was near, she didn't dare to look up for fear of causing this one's displeasure.
<br><br>But the heart also can not help but curious.
<br><br>Sir, what exactly does it look like?
<br><br>White hair and pale?
<br><br>The fairy bones?
<br><br>It should be like this, right?
<br><br>Otherwise, how can he be worthy of the word "sir"?
<br><br>Just when I was thinking about it, a lazy voice from the top came out, "You don't have to be polite, feel free to order!"
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Jiang Hong heard the words.
<br><br>At once, he was startled.
<br><br>Not an old man's voice?
<br><br>Rather, a young voice?
<br><br>Could it be that the gentleman was young?
<br><br>And.
<br><br>Why was this voice so familiar?
<br><br>Only when the crowd relaxed from the salute and all raised their heads did she dare to lift her head and look toward that one.
<br><br>He was lazily lying on a recliner and was patting his belly with a futon fan.
<br><br>A white robe.
<br><br>Spotless.
<br><br>Does not reveal a very strong aura, but rather gives a very affable feeling.
<br><br>Confucianism, not eating the fireworks.
<br><br>This is the best power for him.
<br><br>"Sir is really a young man."
<br><br>Jiang Hong shifted her eyes upward, secretly surprised in her heart.
<br><br>She had countless guesses in her mind about this one's appearance.
<br><br>But the truth surpassed all her expectations.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Even though it was beyond all her expectations, but at this moment, she felt that Mr. should be like this.
<br><br>There is no look that fits better than this feeling in front of her.
<br><br>He really.
<br><br>What does he look like?
<br><br>She bit her red lips before finally looking at his face.
<br><br>PS: Sorry sorry sorry, because smoking plus blowing air conditioning, yesterday pat bronchitis plus lung infection, hospitalized, the last few days continuously in the drop of fluid, so only cell phone buckle word, more slow.
