Under the majestic gaze of Old Ancestor Qingshan, Yin Xiong then faltered and told the story before and after.
<br><br>"How outrageous, how outrageous."
<br><br>As soon as he heard Yin Xiong finish speaking, the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak raged and launched a palm, and a building not far away was directly razed to the ground.
<br><br>"Xue'er."
<br><br>"Present."
<br><br>"You immediately notify Zhu Yun and the other senior members of the sect to gather at the Castle Peak Hall."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue did not dare to delay, and with a light sweep of her beautiful body, she had disappeared.
<br><br>"Now you quickly rush back to the mountain and find out for sir, what kind of person is so daring." Old Ancestor Qingshan instructed towards Yin Xiong again.
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Qingshan."
<br><br>Yin Xiong didn't even bother to take a sip of water and rushed towards the mountain with two more subordinates. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Green Mountain Grand Hall.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face was gloomy as he sat at the top.
<br><br>At the bottom, Zhu Yun, Luo Lanxue and the other elders all lowered their heads with a solemn look on their faces.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>The entire hall surged on a layer of thick pressure, the strength of the slightly weak can not breathe over.
<br><br>"Master, this matter is not trivial." Luo Lanxue was the first to step out and hurriedly analyzed, "From what uncle said, sir is already extremely angry about this matter."
<br><br>"What sister said is right." The not-so-old Yin Luo Li also walked out with a face full of anger and said, "Sir is as gracious to my Qingshan Sect, yet in my Qingshan Sect's territory, his disciple was almost brutalized, we must give sir an account of this matter."
<br><br>"Good, the gentleman himself did not do it directly, but informed the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, the intention is already obvious, it is to remind us that we need to give him an explanation." Sect Master Zhu Yun also said with a face full of solemnity: "So this matter we must treat solemnly, so that Mr. feel satisfied, otherwise really wait until Mr. take action himself ...... we can not afford this anger!"
<br><br>"So master, you still take an idea as soon as possible, what to do specifically?" Luo Lanxue looked at the top of the old ancestor of Castle Peak, said with a solemn face.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face was gloomy, his palm slapped violently, and the stone table next to him turned into powder with a bang.
<br><br>"No matter who it was that made a move against Duke Zhong Qing, none of them will get away."
<br><br>After saying that, he waved his palm, and his voice like a flood bell spread throughout the hall.
<br><br>"Pass on my order."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"Open the great mountain protection formation, notify the twelve elders and eighteen guardians, send out the thirty-six Heavenly Deities and seventy-two Earthly Demons, and not a single disciple from the one hundred and eight halls under the sect will be left behind, led by Zhu Yun, all of them will go down the mountain!"
<br><br>"I want to tell those miscreants who made sir angry to regret coming into this world."
<br><br>When the words of the old ancestor of Castle Peak fell, the hall was in shock.
<br><br>This kind of formation was unprecedented even when the Castle Peak Sect was facing a sect war.
<br><br>But it was true, if they couldn't make that one eliminate his anger, I'm afraid that the Castle Peak Sect wouldn't have the need to exist.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>So all at once, deafening voices resounded in the Castle Peak Hall, followed by a stream of light flying out from the Castle Peak Hall, scattering an astral wind.
<br><br>And the one hundred and eight halls of the Castle Peak Sect, countless disciples were waiting for the formation, directly driving towards Pingjiang City, the sound of treading on the ground was deafening.
<br><br>At the same time, the thirty-six Heavenly Deities and seventy-two Earthly Demons mounted on the flying demon beasts raised by the sect and formed a formation in the sky, forming a huge shadow on the ground and whistling towards the sky of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Finally, under the leadership of Zhu Yun, twelve elders and eighteen guardians, feet in the void, with a powerful pressure to fly out, the speed of the strong momentum, like a piece of heavenly meteorite crossed!
<br><br>In Pingjiang City, the entire business of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce suddenly stopped running, the doors of all stores closed tightly, countless intelligence personnel sent out in unison.
<br><br>In less than half an hour, a pigeon transmission from the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce landed in the hands of Old Ancestor Qingshan.
<br><br>The note was opened, and his face rushed with killing intent.
<br><br>"Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>With a command, the huge formation of the Castle Peak Sect marched towards the location of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Pingjiang City abruptly changed the sky.
