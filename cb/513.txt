Under the many means of the Genting Empire, the cloth plan of everything behind this was already in operation.
<br><br>They first used a month's time to finalize the candidate.
<br><br>It was a Golden Immortal powerhouse.
<br><br>Through manipulation, he would stumble upon a secret realm three days later.
<br><br>Destruction and others have long explored that there is a formation inheritance in the secret realm, and this person will get this formation inheritance.
<br><br>After getting the formation inheritance, this person will, after half a month, pass through the yellow sky sealing place, and just happen to feel the formation fluctuation of the sealing place.
<br><br>And it so happens that this person got the formation inheritance, there is a method to unlock this formation, so it will accidentally unlock the seal of the yellow sky.
<br><br>"Everything is set up."
<br><br>Perdition and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch stood at the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar and revealed the only smile they had in recent times.
<br><br>They had really been haggard and spent too much of their minds and hearts in recent times.
<br><br>Be aware. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This seemingly simple process, behind the scenes involved in the amazing calculating power, and to do as much as possible to reduce the cause and effect, can be said to be difficult and difficult.
<br><br>Even other not to mention, just they find that has the formation heritage of the secret realm, it took a great effort.
<br><br>And to design the target to discover the secret realm, enter the secret realm, to safely get the secret realm formation inheritance.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>If there was not the entire Genting Empire to mobilize, it would have been impossible to do all this, and everything was just right.
<br><br>Three days later.
<br><br>Under the attention of many pairs of eyes.
<br><br>This Golden Immortal powerhouse really walked into the secret realm according to their design, and in the secret realm, although it was perilous, the final result was not what they expected, this person successfully received the formation inheritance.
<br><br>"Look, the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar has changed."
<br><br>And at the moment that person successfully accepted the formation inheritance, the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch was surprised to find that the chaotic color of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar increased.
<br><br>Perish the world and look.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>At this moment, the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar was glowing with a leisurely light, and the chaotic color had been raised a little bit compared to before.
<br><br>Although the increase was very little, but it was a real increase.
<br><br>This brought a smile to the faces of the World Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch.
<br><br>This was a good sign.
<br><br>It also proved that the two people's efforts were not in vain.
<br><br>The two people's hard work had finally paid off.
<br><br>"This person's entry into the secret realm shouldn't have increased qi luck, but just because it was a part of our layout, it produced such an effect, it's hard to imagine how much chaotic color it will add to the qi luck immortal pillar when the yellow sky seal is lifted." The Genting Kingdom Monarch said excitedly.
<br><br>"Yes, really looking forward to it!"
<br><br>Extinction's eyes similarly shone with brilliance.
<br><br>"Next, it's just a matter of waiting for time to pass!"
<br><br>Under the expectation-filled wait of the World Exterminator and the Genting Monarch, more than ten days had passed in a flash.
<br><br>"Your Majesty, Lord Destruction, the target is only one day's distance away from the sealing place, and without incident, he will arrive on time tomorrow!"
<br><br>In the Genting Palace, someone came to report the news every few hours, and at this moment, a subordinate came to report the news.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"Bravo!"
<br><br>Genting king laughed heartily, waved his palm and said, "This layout, the extraordinarily present here, all have great merit, everything is rewarded after the matter."
<br><br>"Congratulations to the king, congratulations to the Lord of extermination, the victory is in hand!"
<br><br>The crowd has knelt down, emitting enthusiastic voice.
<br><br>For a time, the entire atmosphere of the palace was in the midst of cheers and encouragement.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, all the ministers are flat!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler waved his big hand, and a gentle force lifted up all the people present.
<br><br>Then he looked at Perdition and shouted, "O Perdition, then we will wait here in meditation and witness the growth of the Qi of the Qi Immortal Pillar together."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Perdition was also full of smiles.
<br><br>Ever since the Immortal River Chaos Monument opened for planning, it was simply that everything had gone wrong, and now it had really been a long time since it had gone this smoothly.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>Two streams of light crossed, a man and a woman.
<br><br>The man was dressed in fancy clothes, extraordinary temperament.
<br><br>The woman was dressed in black, with a faint power lingering in her body, her eyes like starry eyes, all through the color of heaven and earth.
<br><br>If any of the Heaven and Earth Sect's senior brothers were here, they would have discovered that the two were Jia Jia Qin, who was ranked seventh in the Heaven and Earth Sect, and Mo Tian Ji, who was ranked sixth.
<br><br>"Sixth senior sister, in just a few months' time, all the senior brothers have built up in all aspects, but I am the only one who has not done anything yet."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin said with a sense of loss, "The good thing is, some time ago I looked through the ancient records and said that an ancient beast was sealed in this location a few eras ago, so this matter of lifting the seal may require the help of senior sister."
<br><br>"Ancient beast?"
<br><br>Mo Tianji moved her jade finger and said, "Just this kind of fierce beast, is senior brother sure of subduing it?"
<br><br>"Don't worry, senior sister, this beast has been sealed for several eras, its strength has long been ten to one, it should still be sure."
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin laughed: "I mainly think that after conquering it, it will be well cultivated, and when its strength is restored, it may be able to be useful in the future in the master's grand plan."
<br><br>"If not, we can also catch it and let the fourth senior brother fry it and give it to the master for the wine, I remember that the master happens to like to eat wild food!"
<br><br>"Senior brother really has a heart."
<br><br>Mo Tianji nodded his head gratefully.
<br><br>"Senior brother can always think of the master his old man, just this filial heart of senior brother, I will not refuse you."
<br><br>"Let's go, take me there and we'll break the formation instantly."
