After shaking her head, she turned her questioning gaze to Yi Feng and asked, "By the way, when you were in the cave before, did you find anything unusual?"
<br><br>"Abnormal?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>"Or rather, did you meet anyone?" Yun Yaoyao asked again.
<br><br>"Neither!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head again.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yun Yoyo couldn't help but rub her temples, looked at Yi Feng, and couldn't help but ask: "Are you really, a mortal and not a cultivator?"
<br><br>"Or what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave her a blank look.
<br><br>This woman, simply which pot is not to mention which pot. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao shook her head and knew that discussing this with Yi Feng, a mortal, would not yield results.
<br><br>As for who that mysterious person really is.
<br><br>Let's slowly pursue it later.
<br><br>Of course, she might be overthinking, this mysterious person just happened to appear near the cave, it's not her business.
<br><br>"All right, I'll send you out of the mountain now!"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao said, grabbed Yi Feng's arm and swept high into the sky.
<br><br>"Don't you want to go to the immortal ruins?"
<br><br>In mid-air, Yi Feng asked Yun Yoyo.
<br><br>"This relic does not know when it will open, so it is not too late to send you back first." Yun Yoyo said.
<br><br>"Oh, okay, but don't forget the money you owe me." Yi Feng added.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yun Yoyo's pretty face couldn't help but blacken.
<br><br>"Don't mention it, don't mention it, just remember to give it to me." Yi Feng smiled and said, "By the way, is this immortal relic left behind by an immortal?"
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao nodded.
<br><br>"There should be quite a few good things inside then!" Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yun Yoyo explained, "It's just that at a realm like ours, there's not much use for ordinary opportunities anymore, and this time I came because that one might have left immortal weapons within the relic."
<br><br>"Immortal artifacts?"
<br><br>"Good, the owner of this relic should be the immortal Li Yang left behind when the path of immortals was not broken, down to the mortal wanderings of immortals, it is said that he has an immortal weapon Huntian Tablet in his hands, this Huntian Tablet is said to have suppressed immortals, also shot dead gods and demons, the runes on it may also record some immortal laws."
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>For Yi Feng's reaction, Yun Yaoyao was a little surprised, and after giving Yi Feng a glance, she asked in surprise: "You have no interest or yearning for the power of this Hunting Heaven Tablet?"
<br><br>"Well ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and said seriously, "Indeed not interested and not aspiring."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao mouth could not help but twitch.
<br><br>The two of them, flying at an extremely fast speed, swept past countless large mountains along the way.
<br><br>But at this moment.
<br><br>Inside the entire 100,000 Great Mountains, a strange sound suddenly rang out.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>This sound.
<br><br>It rang out like a flood bell, shaking people's eardrums.
<br><br>At the same time, the countless demonic beasts in the entire Hundred Thousand Great Mountains also entered into chaos at this moment.
<br><br>At the same time, a golden light suddenly pervaded from the sky, spreading in all directions and instantly enveloping the entire Hundred Thousand Great Mountains.
<br><br>"Not good, the relics are open, this is the unique descending dimensional pressure of immortals!"
<br><br>Sensing this golden light, Yun Yoyo's face couldn't help but change.
<br><br>"Dimensional descending pressure?"
<br><br>"What does it mean?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"The descending dimensional pressure represents that below the immortals, all are ants."
<br><br>"To put it plainly, all demonic beasts and experts will lose their cultivation under this pressure!"
<br><br>Yun Yoyao said gruffly.
<br><br>"Ah?"
<br><br>"Then what do you mean?"
<br><br>"It's going to crash?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes widened.
<br><br>Just as the voice fell, a sense of falling came, and the two of them flew down towards the ground.
<br><br>"Falling down at this height, you will definitely die, I will throw you into that lake, this is the last thing I can do, whether you can survive or not, can only rely on yourself."
<br><br>Yun Yoyo clenched his teeth and said with an ugly face.
<br><br>After saying that, he used the last ounce of strength in his body to throw Yi Fengfei out.
<br><br>"Hey hey, I don't know how to water!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed.
<br><br>What's more, even if he knew water, now that he fell in that reservoir, he was bound to die ah.
<br><br>Because along with that bell ringing after the whole hundred thousand mountains and set off the sky shaking, like an earthquake, so the calm water surface, also long ago set off a layer of huge waves.
<br><br>Fluttering sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng smashed into the water.
<br><br>At the same moment, Yun Yaoyao herself also heavily smashed on the ground, seriously injured, because under the dimensional suppression, her cultivation half can not use out.
<br><br>And in such a high fall can still save a life, but also because of his day and night cultivation out of the body strength.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Slowly passed.
<br><br>One hundred thousand mountains gradually returned to calm.
<br><br>"Grass."
<br><br>"What the hell kind of place is this!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was full of darkness.
<br><br>After falling in the lake he was sucked in by a whirlpool and then came here.
<br><br>He then poked around and found that there were winding and rugged passages everywhere, just like the labyrinths of his previous life, while the sides of the passages flickered with lingering firelight, giving people an eerie feeling.
<br><br>In addition, the passage also from time to time a sound of beast roar.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng feel very insecure.
<br><br>"Damn, this ghost place, may appear at any time what, have to find a handy weapon to defend ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng groped while thinking so.
<br><br>Originally, he came to Nansha himself also brought some weapons, but walking around and do not know where to lose, should have known what to say to leave a knife in the body.
<br><br>Slowly fumbling under.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Because the front is no longer winding passage, but came to a large hall, this hall is linked to many many passages, Yi Feng is from one of the walk out.
<br><br>Also in Yi Feng into the hall when.
<br><br>At the end of the hall, the black wall, a pair of eyes appeared out of thin air.
<br><br>It was languishing, gazing at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"I never thought that someone would find this place so quickly."
<br><br>"The next step is to see if you are able to break the triple barrier that the old man has placed in this hall within a month."
<br><br>"If you can break it, then old me will reluctantly accept your body."
<br><br>"I just hope, you won't let me down!"
<br><br>Those eyes were hidden in the wall, flickering with a lingering light, thinking this in their hearts.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>He suddenly realized that this white-robed person had suddenly walked up to his nearness.
<br><br>"This?"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"How is it possible?"
<br><br>"I didn't put down a triple barrier, how did he walk over?"
<br><br>"And didn't the descending dimensional pressure I laid out during my lifetime cause him to lose his cultivation, how did he manage to get there without it?"
<br><br>The heart of those eyes set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>But before he could slow down, he found that the white robe once again approached, turned those eyes on him, and couldn't help but come over.
<br><br>For a moment, the four eyes stared at each other wide eyed.
<br><br>"Did he find me?"
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>"There's no way he could have found me."
<br><br>"The ordinary naked eye can't see me, it must be a coincidence."
<br><br>But just as he thought so, he found a finger gouging toward him.
<br><br>"Yo, this bead is so beautiful, I guess it can be sold for a lot of gold coins." Yi Feng muttered in his mouth.
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>Directly picking that bead off one.
