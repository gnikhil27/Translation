The sound of the guitar, at last, lilted away.
<br><br>When the sound entered the ears, the two Martial Emperor powerhouses who were sitting nicely on the green stone slab, their bodies trembled violently.
<br><br>This song is completely different from the feeling just now.
<br><br>The song just now pulled their memories back to the past, while this song was like letting them cross the boundary of time and go directly to the future.
<br><br>Above the high mountain.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin strokes the long zither, looking down on the sky, ruling the world with the zither!
<br><br>Between the vault of the sky.
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's long sword broke through the sky, destroying the stars and breaking through the chopped universe.
<br><br>She, composing the best song in the world!
<br><br>He, created the best sword in the world!
<br><br>For just a moment, the two were like reaching the peak of their lives, completely immersed in it.
<br><br>Time slowed down ......
<br><br>At some point, the guitar in Yi Feng's hand had stopped.
<br><br>A long, long time, the two men only then withdrew from the mood, full of intent, while in the eyes, both reveal a surprise that can not be concealed.
<br><br>Obviously, both of them had gotten a great benefit from this song.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>"Sir the kindness of this song, we two will not forget it!"
<br><br>Not bothering to reminisce, the two of them hastily rose to show their respect.
<br><br>"It's a simple tune, you two are too polite." Yi Feng smiled lightly, for the first time he felt that this qin, chess, calligraphy and painting task was not all waste.
<br><br>It, immediately let him harvest two small fans?
<br><br>"It may be a simple tune for you, but it's a gift from heaven for us both!" Li Jiaxin said respectfully, with a strong sincere face, because the peak of the Martial Emperor half a foot into the Martial Ancestor but many years without a real breakthrough, in this song directly broke through the bottleneck.
<br><br>The longed-for realm of Martial Ancestor.
<br><br>Just around the corner!
<br><br>"Li Gu is right, this is indeed a gift from heaven for us!"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's face also showed the same hidden surprise, he was directly under this song from the fifth level Martial Emperor breakthrough to the sixth level Martial Emperor, I thought it would take at least a hundred years to breakthrough, this is to save him a great effort, this life breakthrough Martial Ancestor, is expected!
<br><br>"So, if you need anything, you can mention it to the two of us, as long as the two of us can do it, even if we go to the mountain of sword and the sea of fire!" The two said in the same breath again.
<br><br>"You guys are really too polite."
<br><br>Two people's words, both let Yi Feng feel embarrassed, just listen to him play a guitar, to be so grateful?
<br><br>Can't help but, Yi Feng has a great change of outlook on the cultivators in this world.
<br><br>It turns out that the TV, novels, all kinds of deceit, cultivators treat mortals like ants cultivation world are false ah, on the contrary, cultivators are particularly good, especially the point of gratitude, even mortals can not compare.
<br><br>Looking at the two sincere face, Yi Feng not too good to refuse them, but really embarrassed to ask them for any payment, after all, he is not short of money, so after thinking about it, said: "If you really want to thank, there is something you help me think of a way!
<br><br>"Please speak, sir!"
<br><br>The two men hurriedly said respectfully.
<br><br>"Uh, just now I accidentally killed a lot of wildlife, although it is some sin, but since they have died, the body is also shelved, might as well get back to get some barbecue meat or, roast meat to eat is not?" Yi Feng touched his nose, smiled and pointed to the surrounding demon beast corpses said.
<br><br>When Yi Feng's words fell, immediately let the two people face shock.
<br><br>This, really is a big deal ah.
<br><br>It's not enough to get a demon Lord king stew soup, actually want to make other demon king and demon spirit into barbecue meat and roast meat?
<br><br>Although their strength is great, the soup of demon king they can't drink it, you can barbecue lepord meat but who has courage to eat it, after all, this move, it is easy to cause the entire demon world's public anger.
<br><br>But how bold is this bigshot!
<br><br>"So senior wants us to?" Li Jiaxin asked.
<br><br>"I mean, there are so many corpses, I really have no way to bring them down the mountain, so you guys must have a way, right?" Yi Feng said with a smile, these food in front of him, but he really can't let go of ah, since he ran into two cultivators, looking at the flying, this kind of small thing should be able to help take care of it.
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin eyelids slightly jumped.
<br><br>This gentleman's words, seems to mean ah!
<br><br>With this person's strength, want to get rid of these demon beast corpses, it is not a matter of waving a hand, but said such words ......
<br><br>Obviously want space and other treasures!
<br><br>Is storage bag?
<br><br>Li Jiaxin shook his head, the storage bag is a necessary thing for cultivators, with the strength of this person can not have, and even more do not need.
<br><br>In other words, this person in front of you, need something more advanced?
<br><br>Thinking of this, Li Jiaxin's eyelids jumped again.
<br><br>Could it be that he ......
