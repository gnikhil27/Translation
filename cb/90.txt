In the grand hall of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Mao Lin was on the left and Mao Yi was on the right, inviting those three Martial Spirit experts to the top seat and were talking and drinking wine.
<br><br>"The chairman is not good."
<br><br>Just then, a man with the gaze of a butler hurriedly ran over.
<br><br>"What's going on?" Mao Lin heavily put down his wine glass and said angrily in a deep voice, "Can't you see that I am drinking with the three lords, why are you rushing in so recklessly?"
<br><br>"Chairman, something big has happened." The butler said anxiously, "Just now, according to our spies planted in the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce, Yi Feng, together with the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce, has closed the store doors and is ready to make a move against my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Mao Lin's face sank.
<br><br>He didn't expect that the titular Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce would actually close its doors because of Yi Feng, and even take action against his Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce?
<br><br>This matter, indeed, is a big deal.
<br><br>If not, it is the battle of the two chambers ah! One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Yi'er, you accompany the three lords drinking wine, I will go to see what is going on." Mao Lin immediately under the command, such a matter, he did not dare to take it lightly.
<br><br>"Chairman Mao, what are you doing to go, continue to sit down and drink ah!" However, Mao Lin was just about to leave when one of the Martial Spirit experts shouted leisurely, "Are you just going to leave the three of us here to sit and watch? This is very rude!"
<br><br>On hearing that, Mao Lin's face flushed with embarrassment and said with his head lowered, "My lord, you heard it just now, that Baofeng Chamber of Commerce actually closed its store for that little bastard and wanted to strike at my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, I, as the president, must go and take charge of the big picture!"
<br><br>"Moreover, my son is still here to compensate for the three of you to drink!"
<br><br>However, that martial spirit expert did not have the slightest intention of asking Mao Lin to leave, but raised the corner of his mouth and knocked on the stool without question.
<br><br>Seeing this, Mao Lin face difficult to sit down.
<br><br>But in his heart, he was still thinking about the matter of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>"Chairman Mao, why are you so worried?" That Wu Ling seemed to see Mao Lin's heart, leaned back on the chair fingertips knocked the table, "is not just a small Chamber of Commerce, with us, you are still afraid of what?"
<br><br>At these words, Mao Lin's eyes lit up with a difficult face.
<br><br>Right!
<br><br>He had three Martial Spirit experts beside him, what else would he be afraid of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce?
<br><br>However, he was still a bit apprehensive and said cautiously, "Your Excellency, we are not afraid if it is simply the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, but the key is that the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce is related to the Qingshan Sect!"
<br><br>"Castle Peak Sect?"
<br><br>That Martial Spirit coldly snorted and said, "Although that Old Ancestor Qingshan is somewhat powerful, but we three brothers are at least at the Martial Spirit realm, do you think that his Qingshan Sect will willingly offend us three Martial Spirits because of a small chamber of commerce?"
<br><br>"I think, which is more important and what should be the trade-off, that Castle Peak Sect should have a number in their hearts, right?"
<br><br>"Right!"
<br><br>Hearing this Wuling expert's analysis, Mao Lin slapped his thighs violently.
<br><br>The worries in his heart were instantly swept away.
<br><br>"Come, three lords, I, Mao Lin, toast you." Mao Lin picked up his drink and said with a rosy face.
<br><br>"That's right!" That Wu Ling raised the corners of his mouth, leisurely lifted his glass and said, "A few of us will just drink here, eat our food, slowly wait for that what's-his-name Yi Feng to come to the door with his people, when all their people arrive, the three of us brothers will then strike together and help you kill all those losers, as many as we can!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Mao Lin drank freely from his hand and threw back his head and laughed out loud.
<br><br>Now, he could completely rest on his laurels.
<br><br>All he had to do was wait for Yi Feng and the people from the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce to come to their deaths.
<br><br>At this time, several small birds swept across the sky.
<br><br>Following that, dozens of ghostly shadows swept through the air, standing in the air and looking down at the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce below, their faces filled with indifference.
<br><br>The next moment, the thirty-six Heavenly Dipper, seventy-two Earth Furies riding flying demon beasts followed, the huge body of demon beasts organized together, in the ground shrouded a large shadow, giving a great sense of oppression.
<br><br>And one hundred and eight halls of the Castle Peak Sect, close to one hundred thousand disciples, have surrounded the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce three circles inside and three circles outside, to prevent anyone from escaping from the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Another heavenly qi surge came, it was the face with anger Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>He was so angry that he offered the Jedi chopper as well, enough to see how serious he was about this matter!
<br><br>"President, President, it's not good, Yi Feng's people are fighting at the door."
<br><br>Just as Mao Lin and the three Martial Spirit experts were drinking freely, another shout came from the previous butler, his anxious appearance caused his paws to trip on the threshold and his whole body rolled straight in.
<br><br>"Chairman Mao, this subordinate of yours, is really timid!"
<br><br>Seeing this, one of the martial spirits mocked disdainfully.
<br><br>Hearing that, Mao Lin was full of embarrassment and quickly drank heavily towards that butler: "I said, I'm drinking with the three lords, don't be so abrupt, besides, if you hit the door, you hit the door, with the three lords here, what's the big deal?"
<br><br>"But Chairman, they, they came with many people!" That butler added with an anxious face, "We definitely can't take it lightly!"
<br><br>"Noisy."
<br><br>However, that martial spirit seems to not want to listen to the butler to say one more word, directly a wave of the arm, that butler directly into a rain of blood, while the gaze to Mao Lin, said leisurely: "Chairman Mao, your people, does not seem to trust us too much ah?"
<br><br>"How could how could ......"
<br><br>Mao Lin hurriedly explained: "He a small housekeeper know what, how to understand the three lords of the powerful, only see that Yi Feng's people are more scared, you do not know that in the eyes of the three lords, come more people are only to send death."
