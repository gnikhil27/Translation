"I suspect that the heaven and earth visions in the First Line Valley were also staged by Mister."
<br><br>Night Energy said with a brainstorm, "In order to branch out those four people."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Night Yi asked suspiciously, "Why did father say that?"
<br><br>"Think about it, the less people know about such a big event as the gentleman selecting people, the better." Night can explain: "So I guess ah, sir does not want to see those four people at all."
<br><br>"That's true."
<br><br>Night Yi smiled and nodded with realization: "Those four people because of the heaven and earth vision as soon as they left, we ran into the senior, how can there be such a coincidence?"
<br><br>"It seems that the matter that we met the sir, as well as the chance we got here in the sir, can not be known by those four people!" Night Energy said solemnly.
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>Night Yi solemnly nodded her head.
<br><br>"Also, since we are so lucky to be selected as the lucky ones by Mr. Valuable, then we must work hard and pick up this beam ah!" Night Energy added. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yes, we must not let sir down!" Night Yi nodded her head.
<br><br>"Then it's not too late, let's hurry back to close the door and first break through the cultivation level that we have just suppressed without breaking through first!"
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Father and daughter flew out one after another and left Guan Tang City.
<br><br>A few days had passed in a flash.
<br><br>On top of a mountain cliff.
<br><br>The four great patriarchs of the Northern Sea were gathered here.
<br><br>And below them was a canyon that spread out and could not see the end.
<br><br>The canyon is filled with thick mist, visibility is less than three feet, and if you stand at the bottom of the canyon and look up, you can only see a finger width of the sky.
<br><br>This is precisely the famous One Line Valley.
<br><br>And some time ago issued the heaven and earth vision is here, after the heaven and earth vision, inside also faintly came a powerful fluctuations.
<br><br>But before the canyon entered, it ran into two powerful enemies.
<br><br>Two people wearing hats and black robes, it was impossible to see what they looked like, let alone know where they came out from.
<br><br>And as soon as they met, they launched a killing move against their four great patriarchs.
<br><br>The four patriarchs joined forces against the enemy, but the strength of the two men in black was beyond their imagination.
<br><br>Obviously four against two, after a big battle, not only did they not get half a benefit, but the four of them were injured quite lightly.
<br><br>"Four trash."
<br><br>From the mouth of the man in black, a disdainful voice came out.
<br><br>The four were furious to the extreme, gritting their teeth and drinking, "Who the hell are you people?"
<br><br>"The ones who want your lives."
<br><br>"You four clans are simply not worthy of surviving in the world!"
<br><br>The moment the voice fell, the two black-clothed men disappeared into two black lights, and when they reappeared, they were already in the black fog, coming towards the four sect masters.
<br><br>Within the black fog, there was a hidden killing machine, and a cold light faintly appeared.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The cold light shot towards them, and even though the four Patriarchs held their breath to block it, the moment of contact, the four were seriously injured, their skin was cut open with countless wounds.
<br><br>The four men, became a bloody man.
<br><br>For a moment, the four grew goose bumps and cold sweat.
<br><br>The first time to feel death is so close.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>The killing machine reappeared.
<br><br>The four people's hearts were gloomy and their faces were ashen.
<br><br>The first round of attacks had caught them off guard, and this second round of killing machines had directly cast a shadow of death over their hearts.
<br><br>"Is it going to die?"
<br><br>The four stared at each other, with ten thousand reluctance in their hearts.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, two sword lights came from beyond the sky, dragging out ten thousand feet of light in mid-air, directly locking onto the two men in black.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>Almost in an instant, the black fog that enveloped the four patriarchs disappeared, and the two men were killed on the spot on the ground.
<br><br>"Eh, were they saved?"
<br><br>"Those two swords, so strong!"
<br><br>The four great patriarchs reacted with hindsight and hurriedly looked to the sky.
<br><br>"We, the four of us, thank the two seniors for their help."
<br><br>The four bowed and paid their respects to the two people who had struck.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When the two men stepped into the air and approached, the four patriarchs were stunned.
<br><br>"Night Energy?"
<br><br>"Night Yi?"
<br><br>"How could it be you two?"
<br><br>The four exclaimed out in shock at the same time, shouting incredulously.
<br><br>"How can't it be us?"
<br><br>Night Energy gave them a blank look and said indifferently.
<br><br>"But, but how come you guys are suddenly so strong, those two swords just now, how did you guys do that?"
<br><br>"Yes, Night Energy, I do remember that a while ago you were not as strong as the four of us."
<br><br>"And your daughter, when she was inside the Guan Tang City a few days ago, she was only at the cultivation level of a Martial Saint, now how, how is it that she can't see through it?"
<br><br>At this moment, the four people simply had ten thousand whys to ask.
<br><br>They couldn't figure out how this father and daughter were suddenly so strong even though they were trying to figure it out.
<br><br>The man in black who had left them helpless was cleaved by a single sword?
<br><br>"Humph, you only need to know that it was us father and daughter who saved you, why ask so much?" Night Energy said arrogantly.
<br><br>"Okay, no other questions, what is the matter with your strength?" The Taiyi Valley Valley Master still couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Not telling you guys."
<br><br>Night Energy's head swept away with an arrogant look.
<br><br>The four people had ironic faces.
<br><br>It looked like, for the matter of cultivation, there was no way that Night Energy would say anything.
<br><br>So, the Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch changed the topic again and asked, "By the way, didn't you guys stay inside Guan Tang City the other day to look for seniors, did you find them?"
<br><br>"No comment!"
<br><br>Night Energy once again skimmed his head.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Four angry red face, quite angry said: "at the beginning did not agree that we came here, you two are responsible for looking for seniors, there is news will be the first time to tell us?"
