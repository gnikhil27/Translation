"It is unlikely to go down the mountain for the time being, I still have to pick medicine." Yi Feng shook his head and laughed: "However, what is happening, which I am curious?"
<br><br>"Picking medicine?"
<br><br>The woman looked at Yi Feng with a surprised face and said icily, "Are you really not afraid of death?"
<br><br>"Also strike ......"
<br><br>Said, the woman righteous up, looking at Yi Feng said: "Let you understand how high and thick the sky is in this world, lest you continue to be obsessed with losing your life."
<br><br>"There are demonic beasts in this world, you know, right?" The woman asked.
<br><br>"Heard of it."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded.
<br><br>"In this Makufu Mountain Range, there are quite a few demonic beasts that exist, and the strongest ones among them are already at the Demon Emperor realm."
<br><br>The woman said leisurely: "The realm of demon emperor, is already a lord of the demon world, and this matter, then appeared in the owner of our territory of several thousand miles, the Bogu demon emperor."
<br><br>"Although this Bogu Demon Emperor is cultivated from a king's eighth, but due to its long life span, its cultivation is profound." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Hmm."
<br><br>Yi Feng listened attentively, although the heart still has little concept of the demon emperor, but it sounds like it should be very bullish!
<br><br>"But it is such an expert who is in charge of all the demons, but he was captured!"
<br><br>The woman said again.
<br><br>"Captured?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked in surprise.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>The woman nodded, and her tone became solemn as she continued, "It was a human, a very strong and powerful human ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, she showed a look of awe, with a look of longing in her eyes.
<br><br>"This person's strength is monstrous, alone, broke into the cave of the Bogu Demon Emperor, not only took away the treasures of this demon emperor, but also this demon emperor to raw capture, said to ......"
<br><br>"To what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was also dropped up curiosity.
<br><br>The woman's tone could not help but shockingly said, "said to capture this demon emperor home stew to drink!"
<br><br>"Soup stew to drink?"
<br><br>Yi Feng opened his mouth wide, subconsciously glanced at the old Wang Biao hanging in the tree, did not expect this expert, catch this Wang Biao demon emperor is also stew soup to drink, this hobby is really comparable to him ah!
<br><br>"And it is because of this that caused the wrath of all the demonic beasts throughout the Shade Mountain Range."
<br><br>The woman said with a palpitating heart: "Under the union of several other demon emperors, the demon beasts of the entire Makufu Mountain Range launched an extermination order against this human powerhouse, only this human was not found, but my disciples of the Royal Sword Sect suffered an unwarranted disaster!"
<br><br>"However, this Bo Gu Demon Emperor has been doing evil for many years, although some of my disciples of the Royal Sword Sect died, but it was worth it to get rid of this evil!"
<br><br>"So, if in ordinary moments, you are lucky, you may still be able to live a life, but now ......"
<br><br>The woman's voice was a beat.
<br><br>Shook his head, looked at Yi Feng said solemnly: "As long as the demon beast found, you simply have no way to live, especially you are only a mortal ......"
<br><br>"So you'd better go down the mountain as soon as possible!"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>This one really makes it difficult for Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Let's also separate." The woman stood up and said, "I have several demon kings tracking me, if you follow me, I'm afraid I don't have the effort to take care of you."
<br><br>With that, the woman held her longsword in her hand and was about to leave.
<br><br>"Wait." Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>The woman stopped and inclined her head.
<br><br>"You still have wounds on your body, how about putting some herbs on it?" Yi Feng said, "I still have herbs here."
<br><br>"The kindness is appreciated, but ......" the woman was slightly grateful, but bluntly refused: "Your mortal stuff, it's useless to me."
<br><br>After saying that, the woman's body flashed and disappeared in the woods.
<br><br>After the woman left, Yi Feng also distressed in the same place, but when you think about it, the mountain is not that scary, after all, he came down in the past few days, did not encounter any danger.
<br><br>To say that there is any danger, but before a wolf to attack him, at least Yi Feng also practiced a few hands, with a shovel to shoot dead.
<br><br>Besides, he still needs to find medicine for Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Can not find the medicine, Zhong Qing although in the previous treatment of life without worry, but there will be a great after-effects, so little age, he does not want his apprentice to fall what the root of the disease.
<br><br>A shake.
<br><br>Three days have passed.
<br><br>In a mountain forest, the woman with the sword had a heavy face, and the corners of her mouth were hanging with a trace of blood.
<br><br>Just now, she had another battle, and two demon king two defeated, of course, this is not the most serious, the most serious is the entire mountain range has been blocked by the demon beast to, simply can not get out.
<br><br>She dragged her tired body while thinking about the way to escape, while the mind remembered the youth of three days ago.
<br><br>Can not help but reveal a bitter smile.
<br><br>She can't escape even with the strength of the Martial King, let alone the youth.
<br><br>In today's demon beast-infested mountain range, I'm afraid a night will not survive, after all, a mortal body, even if you encounter any small demon is afraid to hide.
<br><br>And now the whole mountain range, in addition to the mysterious expert is nowhere to be found, it is estimated that she is the only one left alive.
<br><br>Although the heart has regret, but she and that person is only a casual acquaintance.
<br><br>For this kind of thing, she can't do anything about it.
<br><br>There was only a cry of regret!
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Just then, she heard what seemed to be movement in front of her, and her ghost-like body flickered away, and she immediately stared at the unbelievable eyes.
<br><br>That green-clothed ......
<br><br>The familiar back carrying a small bamboo basket ......
<br><br>This is not the youth, or who?
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>And humming a song?
