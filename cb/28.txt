 Old man Wu's palm couldn't help but tremble as he asked solemnly anew, "You mean, this is for me?"
<br><br>"Yes, it's for you." Yi Feng waved his hand indifferently and said.
<br><br>Old man Wu immediately sucked in a breath of cold air, the whole person felt some dream, still some not quite dare to believe, asked again: "really give me?"
<br><br>"It's just a rake head, it's no big deal." Yi Feng did not care to say.
<br><br>Is not a ...... rake head?
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, immediately let the old man Wu straight rolled his eyes, almost did not draw over.
<br><br>But in reaction, his heart was even more shocked and incredible, because he found that he had underestimated Yi Feng before, Yi Feng's rank in his heart, directly rose another level.
<br><br>Could not help but speculate, this appearance of young, but in reality do not know how many years of life of the old monster in the end what kind of person?
<br><br>Even the hallowed holy stuff is so disdainful?
<br><br>"Of course, this rake head of mine is not given to you for nothing." Then, Yi Feng added, as much as he wanted to directly give this rake head to the old man, he was not yet a saintly mother to such an extent.
<br><br>After all, in terms of the economic situation, he is now also the mud Bodhisattva over the river itself. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Old man Wu nodded his head.
<br><br>He also never thought that Yi Feng would give him a sacred divine weapon for nothing, after all, this kind of divine object itself is rare, many people even if they have heavenly treasures, it is not always possible to exchange for a sacred divine weapon.
<br><br>So he was also apprehensive.
<br><br>Exactly what would Yi Feng ask him to pay, or ask him to do?
<br><br>And himself, would he be able to do it?
<br><br>For a while, he squatted on the small stool, like a child, waiting blearily for Yi Feng's next words.
<br><br>"We are also considered old friends, certainly not with you when the market price, I will give you a 50% discount!" Yi Feng said with a smile, 50% is also the lowest price in his heart, although this old man is a farmer, but a 50% discount rake should be able to afford to buy.
<br><br>Hearing that, old man Wu's body trembled a little.
<br><br>Fifty percent off of a sacred divine rake, if such a good thing were to be said, I'm afraid it would be enough to cause countless old monsters across the continent to go crazy.
<br><br>But what made his heart hard again was that even with a 50% discount, he simply could not afford it.
<br><br>You know, at that time, his broken seven teeth sacred rake also almost all his savings for so many years, and 50% discount is far beyond the value of the seven teeth sacred rake.
<br><br>What to do?
<br><br>The opportunity of a heavenly gift just miss?
<br><br>Old man Wu held his face, uncomfortable.
<br><br>Seemingly sensing Old Man Wu's embarrassed look, Yi Feng frowned and asked, "What's wrong Old Man Wu, is there not enough money?"
<br><br>Old man Wu's face was full of sweat, and he lowered his head and nodded bitterly.
<br><br>Alas!
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but sigh.
<br><br>It seems that this old man is even poorer than he thought.
<br><br>What could be done about this?
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng sigh, old man Wu was extremely nervous in his heart, in case Yi Feng retracted this opportunity that was a godsend to him, it would be hard for him, so he lifted his head and asked apprehensively, "Old man Yi, no, Mr. Yi, how about ......"
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him.
<br><br>"I still have one thing unfinished, when I finish this thing, I would like to respect you as my Lord and follow you, you see ......" finished, old man Wu looked at Yi Feng nervously.
<br><br>He also did not know if Yi Feng answered back should.
<br><br>"Follow me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng froze for a moment, could not help but glance up the mouth, this old man is in two disease again?
<br><br>First of all, not to mention a rake head to rise to this level, step back, this old man really follow him with what egg? In addition to an extra mouth to eat, maybe one day crunching a death, but also to his post coffin money it.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Old man Wu saw this, his face full of loss, immediately understood that Yi Feng is not willing to accept this condition.
<br><br>But it is true, Yi Feng itself is stronger than him, there is no use to have such a follower like him.
<br><br>"How about this." Yi Feng thought about it, then said: "You take the rake first, the money, you first slowly put together, when you have when you can give me, okay?"
<br><br>Finished, Yi Feng gaze to him.
<br><br>This can be considered his biggest concession, if you have the financial ability of a rake head to give the old man does not matter, but the swollen face fat thing he did not do.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, immediately let the old man Wu excited, full of gratitude and respect for Yi Feng.
<br><br>He thought that he had no chance with this divine rake, but he did not expect that Yi Feng would be willing to make such a big step back.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi, your kindness, old man bear in mind, perhaps you will never use me in your life, but I, Wu Yonghong, hereby swear that if you have any use to find me, ten thousand deaths!"
<br><br>Said, he stood up, extremely solemn bowed towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>With Wu Yonghong oath together, the clouds above the whole Pingjiang City changed with a bang, two lightning flashed in the high sky, a mysterious contract into Wu Yonghong's mind.
<br><br>The deed of oath.
<br><br>If there is a breach, it will be destroyed.
