This extermination of no words.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei a glance to see that this ancestors are not good things, specializing in sacrificing the living to improve their strength.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The most angry for Bone Ben Wei, or because of the appearance of this group of guys, swept his pleasure, let him save half a year of gold coins spent in vain.
<br><br>He left in a disheveled spirit.
<br><br>It seems that the long night can only continue with the companionship of the dogs.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, please ...... please stay!"
<br><br>Seeing that Bone Ben Wei was about to leave, Su Yun Yun Yun shouted in a desperate voice.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei turned back to look at her.
<br><br>"Thank you for saving my life, it was my fault for being so disrespectful to Your Excellency before."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun bowed towards Bone Ben Wei, and a sincere voice came out. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Then continued, "But just now that person's words your Excellency also heard, Chen Yi Zhen is afraid that he will again send people against me, so I would like to ask your Excellency not to leave for the time being, to be able, to be able to protect me for two days ......"
<br><br>Su Yunyun lowered her head and said this request with a stiff upper lip.
<br><br>After all, she knew clearly in her heart.
<br><br>If Chen Yi really people really kill again, with her strength, there is no way to resist, the only way to die.
<br><br>So at this moment, she had to plead for Bones Ben Wei's protection.
<br><br>"Protect you?"
<br><br>"Hmph, didn't you claim that you don't need the protection of this scum?" Bone Ben Wei questioned.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Su Yunyun looked ugly.
<br><br>Her face turned red up to her neck, and a hot pain came from it.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>At the beginning, it was indeed her who looked down on Bone Ben Wei, even with one eye on driving him away, but now she turned around and requested him to come back, why should people agree to you.
<br><br>"Sorry Your Excellency, it was my eyes that were blind before."
<br><br>Just Su Yunyun was not willing, clenching her shellfish teeth, once again emitting an apologetic voice, and then said, "But still, I implore your Excellency to be able to ignore the past and promise me."
<br><br>"This slag is not available."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei angrily flung his robe sleeve and arrogantly refused outright.
<br><br>Su Yunyun's face was ugly, still unwilling to give up, and continued to plead: "I may be saying this excessively and rudely, but without your protection, I will surely die!"
<br><br>"Who said you will surely die?"
<br><br>"Let you die? Not tell you to go back to the martial arts school, in the martial arts school you can still do what can't be done, why do you talk so much?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei came out with a voice that was not nice.
<br><br>Obviously, he is still holding a grudge about the gold coins he spent in vain tonight.
<br><br>Because he can only earn one gold coin for protecting this woman, how to think, this trip is a loss tonight.
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei directly left.
<br><br>Looking at the back of Bone Ben Wei's disappearance, Su Yun Yun Yun's face was ugly.
<br><br>But she also knew in her heart that she could not blame Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>People are willing to help themselves once, is already benevolent to the end.
<br><br>With no place to go, she had to go back to the martial arts school again.
<br><br>Thinking of what Bone Ben Wei said about her returning to the martial arts school and being safe, she held on to a glimmer of hope and hurriedly snooped around the martial arts school again.
<br><br>After the poking around, the expectations were not met.
<br><br>Su Yunyun planted her head, the corner of her mouth was filled with bitterness.
<br><br>Because the scouting just now, although she vaguely felt that the martial arts school is a bit unusual, but to say that it can withstand the attack of the experts sent by Chen Yizhen, this is too much of a fantasy.
<br><br>And the reason why Skeleton Ben Wei said so seems to be a deliberate prevarication to reject her.
<br><br>"Alas, I hope Chen Yi Zhen's people won't come for the time being, and after I turn one to Nirvana, I should also have some self-preservation power."
<br><br>Sitting on the bed, she sighed lightly and comforted herself like this in her heart.
<br><br>With a calm mind and quiet breath.
<br><br>She felt the progress of Nirvana.
<br><br>There should be one more day before Nirvana was completed.
<br><br>After the nirvana, she would have another day to raise her previous cultivation level back, and then reach a new height.
<br><br>In total, it was to take two days.
<br><br>Two days was not a long time, not a short time.
<br><br>If Chen Yi really wants to kill her and then quickly, with his realm, rushing here may not even take half a day.
<br><br>Distracted, she continued to sit cross-legged on the bed, her nervous mind on high alert.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Her eyes snapped open.
<br><br>She clearly felt a huge pressure of might coming from the surroundings of the martial school.
<br><br>She hurriedly got up and walked towards the entrance.
<br><br>At once, she saw a figure appear in the sky of the Martial Hall in front of her, dressed in white robes, just standing quietly in the sky, waiting for Su Yunyun's appearance.
<br><br>Only when he saw Su Yunyun appear, he slightly raised his eyes and said indifferently, "Yunyun, long time no see, goodbye!"
<br><br>"Chen Yizhen?"
<br><br>Seeing this person, Su Yunyun's body trembled, gritting her teeth to death, filled with hatred.
<br><br>"Chen Yizhen, I single-handedly raised you into a talent back then, but you coveted my position and took advantage of my seventh-transformation Nirvana to trap me, making me almost fly into dust and smoke, I never thought that even now, you still want to drive to kill, really good tactics!"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun narrowed her eyes and said word by word, her red lips were bitten out of blood.
<br><br>"Yes, this is precisely to drive you to the end!"
<br><br>"I, Chen Yi Zhen, never leave any loose ends in my work."
<br><br>Chen Yizhen smiled faintly.
<br><br>A faint voice then came out.
<br><br>Instead of being ashamed, it was as if he was stating a matter of course.
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>He lifted his finger, with a smile on his face, and pressed towards Su Yunyun.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>A monstrous crisis emerged in Su Yunyun's heart.
<br><br>She subconsciously wanted to cast a teleportation scroll to escape.
<br><br>But after taking it out, she hesitated again.
<br><br>Because although she knew that the man in front of her was not Chen Yi's real body, but only a doppelganger with a trace of his intention, less than one ten thousandth of his real body's strength.
<br><br>However, she could not even escape the pursuit of the three old men before her, and it was even more hopeless in front of Chen Yizhen.
<br><br>Since this is the case.
<br><br>Using the teleportation scroll to escape again could be considered a superfluous act.
<br><br>She simply clenched her teeth.
<br><br>Waiting for death to come.
<br><br>Just the heart.
<br><br>Is so unwilling!
