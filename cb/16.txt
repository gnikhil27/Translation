<br>"Yu Wujie, what do you have to say?" Zhu Yun asked.
<br><br>"Enlightened Ancestor, Enlightened Sect Master, since there is no way to target the Xuanwu Ancestor, then why can't we avoid war?" Yu Wujie asked.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, some of the senior members of the hall gave a bitter laugh.
<br><br>They knew that it was impossible to avoid the battle this time, the two old ancestors had deep grudges and had signed today's duel contract decades ago.
<br><br>This contract is sworn by the lives of two people, with the heavenly dao as a witness.
<br><br>If anyone avoids fighting, he will be punished by the heavenly dao.
<br><br>And if the Old Man of Castle Peak retreats, then the Castle Peak Sect will be defeated without a fight!
<br><br>"It's just that it's useless to rely on you guys." At this time, the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak scolded, although he also looked grave, but his heart was much more relaxed than the others.
<br><br>Because just now he had already considered the countermeasures.
<br><br>If you can borrow that chopper from the mountain martial arts school Yi seniors, this battle does not have to be without a fight ah!
<br><br>"You all go back!" The old ancestor of green mountain waved his hand. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Old ancestor."
<br><br>"Old ancestor you are?"
<br><br>This attention was not even taken out, and the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak sent people away, could it be that the Old Ancestor knows that he does not have the power to fight and has given up on himself?
<br><br>If this is the case, then the Castle Peak Sect ......
<br><br>The faces of the people were filled with a thick gloom and despair.
<br><br>"I already have a countermeasure." Seeing this, the old ancestor of Castle Peak also knew that he needed to give these people a piece of mind, so he said, "I will go and borrow a sword, as long as this sword can be borrowed, Xuanwu, hum, but so ......"
<br><br>"Knife?"
<br><br>"What knife?"
<br><br>The crowd heard the words, have doubts.
<br><br>You know, although Xuanwu and Qingshan although in the same realm, but it is a difference of ten years of merit, a good weapon although it can significantly enhance the strength, but ten years of merit, especially in this Martial King's realm, the general knife can not really see to bridge the gap.
<br><br>"After I successfully borrowed the knife, bring it back to show you will know." If not for the need to stabilize these people in the sect at this time to prevent chaos, he would not have taken out a knife of this level in a dignified manner.
<br><br>The crowd, although still with doubts and uneasiness, obediently retreated, while looking forward to the knife that the Old Ancestor of Qingshan said in his mouth.
<br><br>"Zhu Yun wait, you accompany me."
<br><br>But the old ancestor of the green hill called out to the sect master Zhu Yun, after all, Zhu Yun's identity is still different, he felt that the existence of that senior under the mountain, it is still necessary to let this sect master know to know.
<br><br>In case this girl is not open-minded, accidentally provoked, then the consequences can not afford.
<br><br>The two soon had reached the streets of Pingjiang City, and there was still some distance from the martial arts school, and the old ancestor of Castle Peak began to collect his breath and walk.
<br><br>"Senior uncle, what are you?" Privately, Zhu Yun, who was also Elder Ancestor Qingshan's senior nephew, looked at Elder Ancestor Qingshan in confusion and asked, "Why don't we just fly over."
<br><br>"Hmph, what do you know?" Old Ancestor Qingshan lectured, "You also immediately collect your breath for me, and look at my eyes later."
<br><br>Although Zhu Yun was puzzled, he also collected his breath, and then asked, "Senior Uncle, this tiny Pingjiang City has the swords you need?"
<br><br>"Frog at the bottom of the well."
<br><br>Old Grandmaster Qing Shan gave a lecture and didn't have the heart to say too much to Zhu Yun, at this moment he was all about meeting Yi Feng.
<br><br>Just walking to the martial arts school, he saw Yi Feng leaning back on the recliner at the entrance.
<br><br>"This is the place." Old Ancestor Qing Shan straightened his body and said excitedly.
<br><br>"Senior Uncle, isn't this just a broken martial school?" Zhu Yun casually swept a glance without looking any further and asked in confusion, "You are my titled Old Ancestor of the Qingshan Sect, why do you need to be like this!"
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>"Also, later on, neither addressing nor all aspects shall be related to cultivation."
<br><br>The Old Ancestor of Green Mountain drank angrily.
<br><br>Zhu Yun did not dare to say more.
<br><br>"Haha, Master Yi." Old Ancestor Qing Shan changed his face and shouted.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was lying in the doorway, took off the bushel fan covering his face, opened a glance, sat up and laughed, "So it's you!"
<br><br>"Eh, it's me."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan nodded his head like a chicken pecking rice, with a respectful face.
<br><br>On the side, Zhu Yun opened his eyes wide.
<br><br>He, didn't he see wrong?
<br><br>The Old Ancestor who usually followed the law in the Castle Peak Sect was actually acting like a chicken in front of a mortal?
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>Obviously, this mortal could be killed with a slap!
