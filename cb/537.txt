Genting Empire.
<br><br>The World Exterminator and the Genting Kingdom Monarch were sitting beside the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, also waiting for news from the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>For them.
<br><br>It was too easy to subdue a small empire's ruler.
<br><br>There would be no surprises at all.
<br><br>But this wait was two days.
<br><br>For two whole days, the two people who were sent out did not send back any news.
<br><br>"Will something happen to those two people?" Perishable asked rather worriedly.
<br><br>"Worry more."
<br><br>The Genting king said with a relaxed face, "My Genting Empire stands in the Lingxu Realm, and no one dares to do anything to them as hundreds of countries come to the court."
<br><br>"Even if they really encounter danger, these affiliated countries will still protect them at all costs." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Because if the emissary sent by my Cloud Top Empire dies, no one would dare to take the blame!"
<br><br>His voice.
<br><br>It was filled with strong confidence.
<br><br>This was the prestige of the Cloud Top Empire in the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Extinguisher smiled, and his face was also relaxed, it seemed that he was indeed overthinking.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Outside the hall, however, a voice came to report, and it seemed to be in a hurry.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch frowned and asked in a deep voice, "What's going on?"
<br><br>"Your Majesty, Lord Perdition, this morning someone found two body bags hanging from the city tower of my Imperial City!"
<br><br>The man knelt on the ground and reported respectfully.
<br><br>"What, body bags?"
<br><br>"What kind of person would be so bold?"
<br><br>The Genting king's face was instantly furious.
<br><br>Since the establishment of his Genting Empire, no one had ever spilled their guts in the Imperial City, let alone hanging a body bag on the city tower.
<br><br>This is simply a provocation to the authority of his Genting Empire!
<br><br>Soon, the angry Genting ruler and the world exterminator rushed to the city tower.
<br><br>At this moment, the city tower had long been blocked.
<br><br>Although in this cultivation world, the death of two people was nothing, but hanging the dead on the Genting Empire's imperial city tower, this was of a very different nature.
<br><br>At this moment, two body bags are still hanging on the city tower.
<br><br>Looking up, it was found that the body bags had long been blood-soaked bright red, a drop of blackened blood, still dripping down from time to time.
<br><br>Seeing this scene.
<br><br>The Genting king was furious to the extreme.
<br><br>With a wave of his palm, two body bags fell to the ground.
<br><br>Two subordinates hurriedly went forward and opened the body bags.
<br><br>A pile of broken flesh.
<br><br>There was no way to see the human form, let alone what it looked like.
<br><br>Provocation.
<br><br>A barefaced provocation.
<br><br>"Order you, within one day not only to find out the identity of these two people, but also to find out who is responsible for all this!"
<br><br>The Genting king's face was dark, and he immediately ordered.
<br><br>After the order was conveyed, he and Perdition reentered the palace.
<br><br>"Such things, no need to be so angry, just leave it to the subordinates." After sitting down, Exterminating World said rather unpleasantly, "For us, the matter of the Qi Immortal Pillar is the key."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch nodded his head rather ashamedly.
<br><br>It was also true.
<br><br>This matter had no reason to make him so angry.
<br><br>It was just that there were people who were not open-minded enough to cause trouble.
<br><br>After all, they had more crucial things to do.
<br><br>Thinking of this, the anger on the face of the Genting kingdom also became dissipated, and the matter of the shrouded body bag also became less concerned.
<br><br>As Perishable said, it would be good to leave it to the subordinates.
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>"Report to the king, the identity of the two people was found out."
<br><br>At this time, the subordinate came to report.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The subordinate had just gotten halfway through speaking.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch opened his eyelids, waved his hand and directly interrupted the subordinate's words, then said indifferently, "Just go and report this matter to the Prime Minister, there is no need to talk to me anymore."
<br><br>Although at first he was indeed a little angry, and could not wait to know the results.
<br><br>But through the extinction of the world, he no longer cared about this matter, his mind was all on the Qi Yun immortal pillar.
<br><br>While on the other hand, the exterminator did not even open his eyes, after all, who the two identities are, he is not interested at all.
<br><br>"But the king, the identity of the two people is not trivial ......"
<br><br>The subordinate said with a difficult face.
<br><br>The Genting king's face slightly flickered with a touch of impatience.
<br><br>"That's all, since we are here, let's talk about who these two people are and how their identities are not trivial!"
<br><br>After a slight pause, he said rather copiously.
<br><br>"The two people are, are the two main emissaries sent to the Wu Tian Empire by the kingdom lord!"
<br><br>The subordinate kneeled on the ground and carefully passed out his voice.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The Cloud Top Kingdom Sovereign, who had just been coping, fiercely widened his eyes.
<br><br>And the originally unconcerned about this matter, Perdition, also bounced up from the ground on his butt.
<br><br>The palm of his hand even grabbed the subordinate's neck, and word by word, a gloomy voice came out: "What did you just say, who did you say died?"
<br><br>"My lord, calm your anger."
<br><br>The subordinate who was grabbed by the neck said with a dry voice in his throat, trembling, "The dead ones are the two messengers sent to the Wu Tian Empire!"
<br><br>"Then why didn't you say so earlier?"
<br><br>On the side, the Genting Empire roared.
<br><br>"It was you, you were the one who didn't want to know and asked me to report to Lord Prime Minister!" The subordinate said with a sobbing face.
<br><br>"How dare you talk back, die!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler directly tore this person in half and stood in place with angry hair.
<br><br>"What's going on, what the hell is going on ......"
<br><br>Extinction was likewise not much better, hissing his voice.
<br><br>And at that moment, behind the two, fluctuations came from the Qi Yun Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>Two people turned around face changed.
<br><br>A bad premonition appeared in the heart, feeling that the qi immortal pillar is going down!
<br><br>Because no need to check, you can guess nine out of ten, Wu Tian Empire has a change of heart.
<br><br>Even, the two people are likely to be killed by Wu Tian.
<br><br>This is equivalent to saying that a son of qi who can increase their qi luck has gone directly to the opposite side.
<br><br>"Rest in peace, rest in peace."
<br><br>"There are accidents normal!"
<br><br>"This Wu Tian was always just a small character, even if he arrived at the opposite side, his qi luck shouldn't be reduced too much." The Genting kingdom ruler comforted in this way.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Exterminating the world nodded his head, his heart is also so comforted up.
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>There was a swish.
<br><br>The Qi Luck Immortal Pillar directly lowered by one third.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two people's eyes glazed over and directly sat on their asses on the ground.
