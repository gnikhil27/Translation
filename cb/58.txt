 Almost instantly.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu was pulled back, four meaningful gaze, looking straight at him.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu that is called a nervous.
<br><br>Forehead cold sweat straight up, the heart of apprehension are about to jump out.
<br><br>It's been years, years since I tried this kind of fear, obviously his treasure Zhentian stone is at his feet, swift cloak is also left aside, at hand, but he did not dare to look at it.
<br><br>"Oh, I've met the four seniors, I don't know what the four seniors are looking for me." Under the gaze of the four, Ning Xuanwu's scalp tingled and he said as he squeezed out a smile on his face that was worse than crying.
<br><br>"It's not that we are looking for you for something, but you, it seems, just said that you want to shoot us to death?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong looked at him with a gloomy gaze and asked in a leisurely manner.
<br><br>These words full of mockery caused Ning Xuanwu's heart to jump and he anxiously explained, "No, no, senior four, don't be angry, how dare I strike out at senior four, I just want to shoot this small martial hall, but I don't want senior four to sit here to clear their mind, so I hope senior seniors will bear with me!"
<br><br>After explaining, Ning Xuanwu's heart breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Although these four people are eccentric, but he is at least a martial king, and timely to stop, and now explain things clearly, should not be too difficult for him, right? The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But however, what he did not expect was that in the moment his voice fell, the four people almost coincidentally stood up, a powerful pressure enveloped.
<br><br>What's more, they carry a strong killing intent.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu a trembling.
<br><br>Face full of confusion, what is going on?
<br><br>I have clearly explained ah, do not let me go even if, why instead reveal such a strong killing intent?
<br><br>"You said, you want to destroy this martial school?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie narrowed his eyes, his voice hoarse and asked word by word.
<br><br>At the same time as he asked, the Yuan Qi in his hands had already condensed, in a stupid state, ready to strike at Ning Xuanwu at any moment.
<br><br>It's over.
<br><br>Said the wrong thing.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu instantly understood, looking at Li Mo Xie has brewed an attack, he no longer cared about what status, crunching a brittle sound.
<br><br>Both legs straightened and knelt on the ground.
<br><br>Sweating profusely, he said, "Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, four seniors, just now I was joking, I was just passing by!"
<br><br>"Passing by?"
<br><br>"Misunderstanding?"
<br><br>"But you just said that you want to shoot this martial arts school?"
<br><br>The four old men looked at Ning Xuanwu from a high position, and said in an icy voice, if that was true, if they dared to offend the land of the gentleman, the four would not hesitate to shoot down towards his heavenly head.
<br><br>"Senior, you misheard, really misheard." Ning Xuanwu begged with a sweaty head, "I don't mean to slap this martial arts school, but the mosquitoes of this martial arts school."
<br><br>Saying that, he closed his hands.
<br><br>Pop!
<br><br>Really fucking killed a mosquito, he was like seeing a savior, and regardless of whether the four people believe it or not, pinching the mosquito in his hand and shouted, "Senior, look at it, it's really a mosquito!"
<br><br>The four people looked at each other, filled with a cold smile.
<br><br>They are not fools.
<br><br>How could such a low-level lie fool them.
<br><br>But also did not make a move on Ning Xuanwu, because after all, this is in the territory of Mr., how to dispose of, is also Mr. say what.
<br><br>Seeing the four people did not make a move, Ning Xuanwu busy relieved.
<br><br>But four people in the side of the pressure brought by the still in, they do not speak, Ning Xuanwu also dare not speak, only able to lower his head and kneel on the ground.
<br><br>Autumn breeze blew, his body shape sluggish ah!
<br><br>But in the heart, but the fire is straight up.
<br><br>"Xu Kun, rub your ancestors eighteen generations, when this daddy comes back, I will definitely destroy your whole family."
<br><br>By this time, how could he not understand that the owner of this martial arts school was these four, otherwise, hearing him say that he wanted to shoot this martial arts school, how could the four people reveal such strong killing intent?
<br><br>The two of them, I'm afraid, also touched the bad luck of these four people were exterminated.
<br><br>As for the shocking stone and swift cloak, although for these four to fill the steps and as a rag is some atrocity, but at least it is still justified.
<br><br>I blame this damn Xu Kun.
<br><br>If you did not spy back a false message, how would my father be so wretched?
<br><br>If I had known that it was the martial arts school of these four people, he would not have dared to come ah, even if the shocking stone and swift cloak is so lost, he would only break his teeth and swallow it in his stomach ah!
<br><br>In the dark.
<br><br>Observe the movement of the martial arts school, such as the demon Ling'er, more open mouth, covering the red lips, looking at their boss obediently kneeling on the ground, that respectful appearance, the hearts of the people called a complex.
<br><br>But also instantly understood that things are not that simple.
<br><br>However, although Ning Xuanwu heart think more, but the face does not dare to show half, still kneeling eyes looking at Wu Yonghong four people.
<br><br>"You are Ning Xuanwu of the Xuanwu Sect, right?" Finally, Chu Mad Lion glanced at Ning Xuanwu and asked.
<br><br>"It's my senior." Ning Xuanwu planted his head and answered apprehensively.
<br><br>"Even if that Ning Jiutian of your family hadn't died, he wouldn't dare to act rudely here, to think that you, a junior ......" Chu Mad laughed coldly and said, "Really out of blue, you are better than blue!"
<br><br>This full of mockery words, let Ning Xuanwu face red, but do not dare to retort.
<br><br>"I don't know where I put the chess piece, I've been looking for it for a long time." At that moment, Yi Feng walked out from the front hall and said with a slightly apologetic voice.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and the four of them fiercely got up, bowed their heads and respectfully shouted, "Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Sir?
<br><br>These four actually called it sir?
<br><br>Kneeling on the ground, Ning Xuanwu looked at Yi Feng who walked out and fiercely grew his mouth.
<br><br>PS: Get a group, one seven one one zero five four four nine.
