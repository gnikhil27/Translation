"Ka!"
<br><br>A pleasant sound came out, and the thing under Yi Feng's feet crushed into smithereens.
<br><br>This scene, looking at the crowd stunned.
<br><br>Big brother, are they all so capricious?
<br><br>You know, this is a random piece of super treasures can cause countless strong people to fight for ah, not to mention that there are two immortal weapons inside.
<br><br>The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the market.
<br><br>The crowd then understood that Yi Feng said this is a pile of trash is not just talk, but really think this is trash.
<br><br>They are also considered to have opened their eyes.
<br><br>Big brother's world, it turns out to be like this.
<br><br>However, at this moment, Yi Feng's heart is simply unbearable.
<br><br>These six people are so dragging, I thought there would be a little material, but did not expect to be such a group of poor people. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>No money and still dragging, I pooh!
<br><br>However, if Yi Feng does not return a little blood from them, is certainly not let them go.
<br><br>So Yi Feng waved his hand and said, "Tie them up first, lock them up in the backyard, continue eating first, and come back to send them off after eating."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The people tied the six men and threw them to the backyard. After disposing of them, the fellows of the Bao Feng Restaurant set up the tables again.
<br><br>At the same time, the store's butler ran towards Yi Feng and whispered, "Mr. Yi, the master knows you are here and specially instructed me that all the money for today's meal will be paid by our Baofeng Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>"In addition, sir's man was injured in our Baofeng Restaurant, so this medical fee should also be rightfully paid by us, so please eat and drink well, sir and all of you."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>At that, Yi Feng's eyes lit up and said embarrassedly, "Is your president so polite, how can I be asked to be nice?"
<br><br>"Sir and our Chamber of Commerce close relationship, a meal is really nothing." The steward said.
<br><br>"Good, then I'll be polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, secretly said this Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce really understand ah, not only just broken things do not have to compensate, today's meal I'm afraid can also save him a lot of money ah.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Inside the hall once again resumed the lively atmosphere before.
<br><br>Good wine and good meat were eaten.
<br><br>"Damn, damn."
<br><br>"What the hell is this place?"
<br><br>"How come there are so many strong people?"
<br><br>The six badly injured green-clothed men were tied with ropes and only now did they sort of breathe a sigh of relief.
<br><br>But just as they breathed a sigh of relief, they realized that something was staring at them.
<br><br>The six people looked their gaze away and immediately found three behemoths, also bound by chains, on the side.
<br><br>"Are they demon beasts?" One man asked.
<br><br>"I don't think so, the Immortal River Continent has never seen such demon beasts." Another person took a look at the three demons and shook his head.
<br><br>"Then it's probably a wild beast."
<br><br>Another person said, "But these people are too hateful, it doesn't matter if they want to kill or not, actually locking us up with such lowly things is too much, this is simply a great humiliation."
<br><br>But as soon as his voice fell, those three gazes suddenly glared over.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"These three beasts actually dare to glare at us?"
<br><br>The six green-clothed men were instantly furious.
<br><br>They were already suffocated and tortured enough today, but they didn't expect that even three animals would dare to glare at them when they arrived here?
<br><br>How can this be?
<br><br>"Animals should have the consciousness of animals, stay well aside."
<br><br>A low voice came out, the six people's bodies were the same, the few aura of their bodies were released and crushed towards the three demonic beasts.
<br><br>However, just as their voices fell, the three demons opened their pouring mouths at the same time.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Wow!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Terrifying sounds came out, despite being bound by chains and losing their cultivation, but the breath of the perennial as a Golden Immortal was still not something that the injured six could withstand.
<br><br>The terrifying breath, immediately pressed the six people could not breathe, involuntarily soft on the ground trembling and shaking.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Immortal, it's an immortal, it's an immortal beast, they're not beasts."
<br><br>"Yes, and not ordinary immortal beasts, it seems to be the kind that Lord Tuan said, immortal beasts that have reached the Golden Immortal."
<br><br>"Woo ...... so powerful!"
<br><br>"Run away, quick ......"
<br><br>The six emitted panicked voices while their bound bodies squirmed like caterpillars and moved towards the corner of the courtyard.
<br><br>And the three demons did not seem to intend to let go of the six, one by one, breaking free of the chains and lunging toward the six, their huge snouts slapping their faces, frightening them in panic.
<br><br>"Quick, squeeze in again, squeeze in, he's going to bite me."
<br><br>Six people huddled in a pile in the corner, shivering, it was good that the three demons were chained and bolted, they could not reach the distance at all.
<br><br>This is what made the six people breathe a sigh of relief.
<br><br>But even if the tiger escaped, six people still want to cry.
<br><br>Today this encounter is what happened, into this restaurant began to encounter more than sixty martial emperors, not to mention, to the outside and encountered more than 300 immortals.
<br><br>The end of the day, was locked up here, I thought I could temporarily breathe a sigh of relief, think about countermeasures.
<br><br>But unexpectedly, there are still three immortal beasts here, and it seems that they are not ordinary immortal beasts.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>The six people's mouths drew backwards, and panic showed in their eyes.
<br><br>What kind of person was that youth at the head of the group!
<br><br>Not to mention having so many powerful subordinates, they didn't expect to have three Golden Immortal level demonic beasts as the bottom card.
<br><br>Just then, there was a sound from outside the courtyard.
<br><br>Then he saw Yi Feng skeleton Ben Wei, and the restaurant steward's walking.
<br><br>"Steward's, I got three wild game here, intend to get to eat, and I am ready to personally cook, there is no problem, right." Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>"No problem, of course no problem." The steward said with a smile.
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng and the others talking, the six men in green stared at once.
<br><br>What?
<br><br>These three immortal beasts weren't their bottom card, but were used to prepare for eating?
<br><br>Did you hear it right?
<br><br>Just when they felt incredulous, they saw the black-robed man beside Yi Feng walking towards the three demons.
<br><br>The three golden immortal level demon beasts were solved without any delay ......
