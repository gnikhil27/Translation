After the breakthrough.
<br><br>Lu Chong stood up with a confident face.
<br><br>One month.
<br><br>Stripped of his bones.
<br><br>From a Heavenly Immortal who was not even a dog, he was promoted to a great power at the late stage of the True Origin Immortal realm.
<br><br>In the past, one would not even dare to think about it.
<br><br>This kind of realm is considered an expert everywhere.
<br><br>Take their Great Harmony Sect's Patriarch, he was only in the middle True Origin Immortal realm.
<br><br>And in terms of the younger generation, it is even more remarkable.
<br><br>Such as that fianc√©e of his, Li Qingxuan who had awakened the Desolate Ancient Immortal Body, the Holy Maiden of the Thousand Seekers Sect, such a supreme genius was only a Ninth Turn Xuan Xian.
<br><br>"Great Harmony Sect." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"And Li Qingxuan!"
<br><br>"I just don't know what expression I'll have when I appear in front of you in this current state." Lu Chong clenched his fist.
<br><br>"Senior, I can't wait, let's go out now!" Lu Chong laughed.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Shouting for half a day.
<br><br>Gong Chen did not respond, but sat aside with his feet hanging down and chest puffed.
<br><br>"Senior Uncle, what's wrong with you?" Lu Chong couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Don't call me."
<br><br>Gong Chen's head tilted, squatting in the corner and stroking his heart, the more he thought about it, the more angry he was, so he couldn't help but curse, "Lu Chong, let me ask you, that candy just now, why didn't you share half of it with me?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Senior, I did not give you you do not want?"
<br><br>Lu Chong said with an innocent face.
<br><br>"Hmph, don't want it if I say no? After all, I am your elder, so I have to be polite and courteous to you, right?" Gong Chen said with a painful face, "You are good, I said no you really do not give me, do you know, just now the power of that candy is how big?"
<br><br>"You can't swallow that much power by yourself, do you know how much power you've wasted?"
<br><br>Gong Chen cursed and cursed out his voice.
<br><br>Suddenly, he noticed that there was still a candy bag thrown on the ground.
<br><br>His eyes lit up.
<br><br>The palm of his hand reached over with lightning speed, and his tongue also stretched out lightning-like at the same time.
<br><br>Slightly Slightly ......
<br><br>Slightly Slightly ......
<br><br>The aftertaste is endless.
<br><br>In the subsequent, he also rubbed a sound, directly from the original middle stage of true yuan, breakthrough to the late stage of true yuan.
<br><br>Feeling the powerful power in his body, Gong Chen's previous stifling was swept away, replaced by a strong joy.
<br><br>What a satisfaction.
<br><br>"Ahem!"
<br><br>Looking at the dumbfounded Lu Chong next to him, he pretended to cough lightly twice, pretending that nothing had happened and said, "Chong'er, actually uncle is not such a vulgar person, not to mention coveting your candy, but you are after all my nephew, uncle I am for your own good, hate iron but not steel ah!"
<br><br>"Just now uncle said you said a little heavy, do not worry about it ah ......"
<br><br>"First teleport to the immortal world."
<br><br>......
<br><br>Just a few days' time.
<br><br>The two people then reentered the West Ning Continent.
<br><br>Outside of Xining City.
<br><br>Gong Chen stood in the air, looking at the Xining City not far away, and couldn't help but ask: "What do you plan to do, Chong'er?"
<br><br>"Of course the marriage should be withdrawn, except that Li Qingxuan, is no longer worthy to be put in my eyes." Lu Chong slightly raised his head.
<br><br>He who was originally a waste.
<br><br>At this moment, he was full of arrogance.
<br><br>Li Qingxuan?
<br><br>Desolate ancient immortal body?
<br><br>The Heavenly Daughter?
<br><br>Disciple of the West Ning Immortal Continent Lord?
<br><br>All these titles used to seem like a big mountain to him.
<br><br>But now, what did they count for?
<br><br>When he thought of the girl who often planted flowers by the dung pit on Shadow Island, she seemed to be a Draconic God Body, right?
<br><br>There is also an older sister at the transfer gate registration, seems to be an indestructible body too, right?
<br><br>By the way, the fat lady who often knocks melon seeds and squats at the intersection to talk to Master Lu, seems to be the Chaos Demon Body, right?
<br><br>As for the young lady who helped them register the number of feces, it is the achievement of a horrible fecal body.
<br><br>That little desolate immortal body, in front of any of the above physique, are not enough to see ah!
<br><br>"Since the biggest obstacle in this matter of withdrawal is this West Ning Immortal Continent's continent master, let's take him!"
<br><br>Lu Chong said proudly.
<br><br>"West Ning Immortal Continent in the three continents although quite weak, but the strength of the continent's Lord Li Hongtian, but also to the Star Immortal realm ah, and he is also the body of the demon beast, stronger than human strength, you can still be one realm short of him, have a grasp?" Gong Chen could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Of course I do."
<br><br>Lu Chong said confidently.
<br><br>The palm of his hand was raised.
<br><br>A pair of dung buckets appeared with a bang.
<br><br>Seeing this pair of dung buckets, Gong Chen instantly understood.
<br><br>This was a top-tier immortal weapon, and it was infinitely close to the heavenly level!
<br><br>With such treasures in, although Lu Chong is only late True Element Immortal realm, but clean up a Star Immortal realm demonic beast, but still have a sure thing!
<br><br>Can't help but.
<br><br>Gong Chen also became a little envious of Lu Chong.
<br><br>Envy him as soon as he arrived directly into the dung picking brigade, directly to be able to receive such equipment.
<br><br>Unlike him, although there were many top-tier immortal weapons on the island, many of them were brought from the Heaven and Earth Sect, so they people could only watch top-tier immortal weapons dangling around in front of their eyes all sorts of times every day, but they hadn't really owned one yet.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Cultivation of immortality ah.
<br><br>Qi luck is very important.
<br><br>He stayed on the Shadow Island for so long, the opportunities obtained is not as much as Lu Chong just a month.
<br><br>Especially Lu Chong became the third day of the dung picking brigade, because of the reuse of Master Lu, was assigned to pick a load of Yi Feng's toilet.
<br><br>This load, directly let Lu Chong on a flight to the sky, from the original dog is worse than the Heavenly Immortal, directly rushed to Xuan Xian.
<br><br>"Senior nephew ah!"
<br><br>Gong Chen couldn't help but rub his hands together and said with a smile, "How do you think senior uncle treats you normally?"
<br><br>"Senior uncle treats me as close as a biological father!" Lu Chong said solemnly.
<br><br>"That's a good feeling."
<br><br>"Really my good senior nephew!"
<br><br>"Then look at it, senior nephew, when we go back, can you ask Master Lu for me to see if he still has a shortage of people there?"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Gong Chen couldn't help but swing up his biceps, making a forceful red neck and said, "Your senior uncle I'm a handful of years old, but still have a little bit of strength."
