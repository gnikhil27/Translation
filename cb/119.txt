"Who is playing a song with the pipa East Windbreak ......"
<br><br>While playing the guitar, mouth lightly humming the classic song of the previous life,  On the surface, it seemed to be a way to eliminate the unhappiness in the heart, but in fact, it was Yi Feng who succumbed to the power of the system... 
<br><br>"If Renhao has the slightest accident, my Li family will never end with you <abbr title="Yujianzong">Royal Sword Sect</abbr>." At this moment, accompanied by a strong aura, two streams of light swept towards the mountains. 
<br><br>Hearing this, Xu Mozhu's face looked ugly.
<br><br>Originally, he had only come to the mountain to complete a small task, but he did not expect his disciple Li Renhao to encounter such a bizarre thing.
<br><br>And it just so happened that Li Jiaxin, Li Renhao's aunt, came to visit Li Renhao at the Royal Sword Sect, and such a thing happen at this time.
<br><br>However, even though Li Jiaxin said so, Xu Mozhu did not have the slightest temper. Who made the Li family the top three aristocratic families in the entire <abbr title="Nansha">South Continent</abbr>.
<br><br>"It's just that the benevolent message said that the monsters in the mountains are in all directions, but apart from some little monsters along the way, the strongest is the centipede in his hand." Li Jiaxin said while watching the surroundings. "This centipede is really funny. lets take it back it is also considered a valuable medicinal herbs!"
<br><br>"Yes, fortunately this change is still a good thing for Renhao."
<br><br>Xu Mozhu said with a sigh,he was obviously not much interest in the centipede, his heart is only full of worry, Li Renhao is his disciple and is the <abbr title="Literal translation: first sister">Head Deciple</abbr> of the Royal Sword Sect not to mention, from the Li family, there must not be any incidents.
<br><br>"Let's hope so!"
<br><br>The two swept along observing the movement of the mountain range below.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"That's ......"
<br><br>Just then, Li Jiaxin in flight suddenly slowed down, and finally even stopped.
<br><br>Hearing this, Xu Mozhu also looked over, what he saw made him shutter.
<br><br>"That that ...... that is more than a hundred demon spirits, and more than ten demon king corpses?"
<br><br>"Not bad!"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin also face solemnly nodded his head, his mouth could not help but subconsciously suck in cool air.
<br><br>This kind of gesture is simply terrifying.
<br><br>After all, if such a lineup was put together, even she, a Martial Emperor, would not be able to get a good deal against it, I'm afraid.
<br><br>What's more, demon beasts have always been united, such a practice, is not afraid of stirring up a hornet's nest.
<br><br>She asked herself, she may also have the ability to kill so many demon spirits and demon kings, but does not see the guts to do so.
<br><br>"No wonder all the demon kings and demon spirits in this mountain have disappeared, it turns out that they all died here." Xu Mozhu slowed down and said in a shocked, "Just, such a big gesture, what kind of person is responsible for it."
<br><br>"It should be him."
<br><br>Li Jiaxin turned her sharp gaze towards Yi Feng who was surrounded by many corpses.
<br><br>"Him?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu frowned and said, "But he has no breath, he seems to be a mortal!"
<br><br>"It's hard to say." Li Jiaxin shook her head, "Surrounded by so many demon beast corpses, wouldn't a mortal be afraid, the odds are that it's a person who cultivates a special technique and can't see the cultivation level clearly."
<br><br>"That's true."
<br><br>Xu Mozhu nodded, if it is really a mortal, then the matter is too unjustified.
<br><br>"This person should also be a Martial Emperor, let's go, go say hello and ask what's going on by the way." Li Jiaxin said, while his body swept away quickly.
<br><br>Xu Mozhu nodded, while following.
<br><br>"Ding, congratulations to the host for practicing the zither to the point of perfection."
<br><br>Listening to the system's voice, Yi Feng had no waves, after all, it was still far from being comparable to God.
<br><br>With past experience Yi Feng knows that these are probably divided into seven realms, such as the first glimpse of the doorway, a small achievement, proficency, <abbr title="out of this world">perfection</abbr>, unparalleled, back to the basics, and God.
<br><br>He wanted to practice all the qin, chess, calligraphy and painting to be on par with God, it would take at least a few months.
<br><br>And he was also lucky, perhaps because he used to play the guitar a lot, the qin art reached the realm of God after a few songs, so it was able to save him a lot of effort.
<br><br>"Let's practice again!"
<br><br>"Boring anyway."
<br><br>Yi Feng rested for a moment, and picked up the guitar again, he wanted to hurry up the practice, before his system does something to his martial gym.
<br><br>The second is that at the moment Yi Feng is indeed also bored.
<br><br>However, when the tune sounded, it swept towards Li Jiaxin and made her body tremor, she immediately stopped in place.
<br><br>"What is this person playing in his hand, the zither?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu at the side saw this, could not help but send out a puzzled voice.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>However, it was met with Li Jiaxin's ice-cold scolding.
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's face was a little ugly, at least he was also a Martial Emperor, such a disgraceful scolding was unbearable, and just as he wanted to retort, he found that Li Jiaxin had closed her eyes in agitation.
<br><br>Just when he was puzzled, Li Jiaxin's voice came out again.
<br><br>"I have no intention of scolding you, you only need to meditate and listen to this tune, then you will understand why I did so."
<br><br>Xu Mozhu frowned, unimpressed.
<br><br>However, he did as he was told, but when he quieted his mind, his casual face changed instantly, and a strong look of shock flowed out.
<br><br>"This is ......"
