Yi Feng directly grabbed the black robe, the whole of it blindfolded in it, splitting the head is a violent beating.
<br><br>And Yi Feng's move, causing a commotion in the crowd.
<br><br>"Beat the dog, beat the dog."
<br><br>Yi Feng had to explain with an embarrassed face, and after another beating, he grabbed the black robe, and dragged the whole skull head towards home.
<br><br>Dragged to the store inside, Yi Feng the more angry he thought, and again two fierce kicks over.
<br><br>This broken thing, never let him save his mind.
<br><br>Today it is not the Wang's vegetable garden to spoil, tomorrow it will be the cattle of Li's family to death, did not expect that this ate the ambition of the leopard, but also as a salty pig hand.
<br><br>But the most hateful thing is that this thing is like a maggot on the bone.
<br><br>He threw it, he ran back.
<br><br>He dug a hole and buried it, and he climbed out again.
<br><br>Finally he locked it, a total of not a few days of peace and quiet, and fucking out, in short, a variety of ways to use all, can not get rid of. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>Suddenly, that black robe a writhing, a skeleton head emerged, slapping the upper and lower jaws, towards Yi Feng to transmit the voice.
<br><br>"I a your sister."
<br><br>Yi Feng just weakened a little flame, and was rekindled, gritted his teeth and said, "Laozi demolished you this time, see what else you can do."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng knocked its skeleton head off with one fist and rolled it on the ground with a ding-dong ding-dong.
<br><br>However, the skeleton head that rolled on the ground opened its mouth again.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>At this same time, the skeleton frame that was at Yi Feng's feet suddenly extended a palm, and then raised a middle finger towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Aiya, you still learn quite like?"
<br><br>Since Yi Feng erected someone else once, this broken thing often learn to have a model, which immediately made Yi Feng angry seven orifices, the skeleton shelf under his feet, and began to open the demolition.
<br><br>"Master, there is someone outside looking."
<br><br>Just then, Zhong Qing came over and said respectfully, "It seems to be someone from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>"People from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's brow frowned and asked in a deep voice, "What are the people from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce doing looking for me?"
<br><br>"They said that Master's previous book, the Dream of the Red Chamber, still had its share of money, so they asked Master to go over and get the money." Zhong Qing said.
<br><br>"Do not go, either ask him to send over."
<br><br>The road is different, Yi Feng simply do not want to pay attention to them, really do not send over also does not matter, anyway, that book is not a few money, the big deal is not.
<br><br>"But master, they also sent someone to invite a sedan chair." Zhong Qing said again, "said must be master personally go."
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, then said, "This way apprentice, you go to go instead of me, get the money back and go, leave the rest."
<br><br>"Yes Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded respectfully.
<br><br>After Zhong Qing left, Yi Feng continued to disassemble the skeleton head, with great effort, it was only then the skeleton torso, palms, legs ah and so on disassembled, and then gave it to lock it into different rooms.
<br><br>And the skull head, also by Yi Feng pressed in the well under the cover.
<br><br>Clapping his hands, Yi Feng then revealed a smile of satisfaction, just stretched a lazy back ready to drink a mouthful of water, the door came rushing disciple ran a person, while the mouth anxiously shouted: "Master Yi, Master Yi, bad, something happened."
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly ran out.
<br><br>The person who came was none other than the boy from the beef restaurant across the street. The boy hurriedly shouted, "Master Yi, your young apprentice Zhong Qing is in trouble, I'm afraid he's not going to make it, go check it out!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face changed, he didn't even have time to close the door, he followed the beef noodle shop's boy and ran out.
<br><br>Then the two came to a hutong.
<br><br>At both ends of the hutong, there were a lot of people watching and pointing at the hutong and talking about it.
<br><br>And as soon as Yi Feng came, a bloody smell came towards him, the ground was full of corpses, the palanquin had long been attacked unlike any other, and the few palanquin bearers had long lost their voices.
<br><br>Zhong Qing, on the other hand, was lying on the ground looking at Yi Feng moribundly.
<br><br>Apparently, Zhong Qing in the palanquin had been attacked and a great battle had subsequently broken out.
<br><br>"Disciple."
<br><br>Yi Feng rushed directly towards Zhong Qing, checking his injuries, while his eyes suddenly turned red.
<br><br>"Master ...... Master, I'm afraid I can't do things for you."
<br><br>Zhong Qing said with blood all over his body and weak breath.
<br><br>"No, it's impossible, you don't say anything, master won't let you die." Yi Feng held back the anger in his heart, picked up Zhong Qing as soon as he ran, and rushed towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>After returning to the martial arts school, Yi Feng hurriedly laid Zhong Qing on the bed, and then brought out all the medicines at home.
<br><br>First, he stopped the bleeding, and then treated the wound.
<br><br>After working for most of the day, Zhong Qing's breath stabilized and he was free from life threatening, so Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>However, his eyes were replaced by anger, with raging flames in his eyes.
<br><br>"No matter who it is, I'll tell you to pay in blood even if I lose my family!"
