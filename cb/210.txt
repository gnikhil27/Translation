Jiang Yu stepped on the Emperor's Qin Platform, carrying a huge pressure all over his body as he swept all the way over Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The sound was so great that it made the whole Pingjiang City wind up.
<br><br>At the same time, it also caused a riot among the people of Pingjiang City, who all hid in their homes and closed their doors tightly.
<br><br>"Quickly tell me, where the hell is that person?"
<br><br>Jiang Yu grabbed Yu Wujie and drank urgently.
<br><br>"Over there, in the martial arts school over there." Yu Wujie shouted with a snotty nose and a tear, crying out.
<br><br>Jiang Yu's eyes narrowed, carrying an appalling might to rush, and soon saw the martial hall Yu Wujie pointed to.
<br><br>And not far away, the book qin painting and the fifth formation and other people followed Jiang Yu's breath also chased over, also saw Jiang Yu rushed towards that martial arts hall.
<br><br>But several people did not dare to approach and stayed far away.
<br><br>"That person who composed the song should be that martial school." Fifth Longkong couldn't help but say, "But what does this Jiang Yu want?"
<br><br>"He wants to seize the person who composed the song!" The fifth formation explained. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"But why does he have to take over the person who composed the music?" The fifth formation asked again.
<br><br>"Because we cultivate people with qin, and the traditional cultivation way is different."
<br><br>In the front, the book qin painting explained: "and can compose such a tune people generally have a top songwriting talent, this kind of talent for us, more important than ordinary cultivation talent, and after taking the body can inherit the original owner's talent."
<br><br>"It's just a pity that this person who composed the songs ......"
<br><br>Said, book qin painting looked at that small martial arts hall tightly frowned, can not help but reveal a regretful look.
<br><br>"So it is!"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong nodded with sudden realization.
<br><br>And at this time, Jiang Yu had already reached the martial arts hall not far away.
<br><br>"Right here, right here, this is the place, big master, you let me go, I'm really just a waste, it's not my business!" Yu Wujie cried out loudly.
<br><br>Hearing this, Jiang Yu stared deadly at the martial arts school in front of him, his aura was so dense that under the influence of his cultivation, the sky was surging with wind and clouds.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Accompanied by a thunderous roar, the sky rained heavily.
<br><br>And Jiang Yu's eyes flashed with a brilliant light as he finally rushed towards the martial school.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan, who was chatting with Yi Feng, suddenly changed his face greatly because he strongly felt that a powerful aura appeared outside and rushed towards the martial school.
<br><br>This aura must not be with good intentions.
<br><br>He was just about to get up when Yi Feng, who was playing with the sand eagle in his hand, said leisurely, "What's the hurry, what's the use of you going out now?"
<br><br>"You, sir?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's eyes widened.
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>This old man, really.
<br><br>It's raining so hard, only to think about leaving, this is not fucking shit out, only to think about picking up the pants?
<br><br>White glance, ignore him, continue to play with the hand carved out of the pistol.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan looked at the leisurely Yi Feng, the heart felt admiration.
<br><br>Mr. is worthy of being Mr..
<br><br>Outside the strong enemy attack, but still able to maintain this calm.
<br><br>But in retrospect, it is true, Mr. casually mentioned him from a hot chicken martial spirit to the half-esteem realm, and how will be afraid of such incoming enemies?
<br><br>In fact, he had overthought it.
<br><br>As Mr. said, even if he went out with this kind of strength, it would be of no use.
<br><br>I just wonder, how will Mr. wait to solve the incoming enemy?
<br><br>It seems that this is the first time I have seen you fight.
<br><br>Really looking forward to it!
<br><br>Jiang Yu had already approached the door, and from the urgency in his eyes, it could be seen that he did not intend to delay and wanted to rush directly into the martial arts school.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, around the martial hall, several huge breaths suddenly appeared.
<br><br>"Come on people stop, dare to break into the martial hall, die!"
<br><br>The ones who appeared were none other than the three Wu Yonghong who were working in the ground, and their Martial Dignity aura surged out without reservation, stopping in front of Jiang Yu and sending out a warning voice towards Jiang Yu.
<br><br>"What, three Martial Dignitaries?"
<br><br>From afar, Shu Qinhua and the others, who were observing the movement over here, instantly revealed an incredulous look.
<br><br>"How could three Martial Dignitaries suddenly appear in this tiny Pingjiang City." Fifth Longkong's mouth drew a cool breath backwards and said, "And before at the cemetery, I hadn't seen them at all!"
<br><br>"Yes, what's even more shocking is that they are actually holding holy items per capita!" The fifth formation similarly exclaimed in shock.
<br><br>"Looking at them, they seem to be protecting this martial school." Book qin painting said, "It seems that this martial daddy is not simple!"
<br><br>"Yes, it's just a pity that in front of Jiang Yu, three Martial Dignitaries don't work either!" The fifth formation sighed.
<br><br>And Jiang Yu looked at the three Martial Dignitaries that suddenly appeared, his face suddenly sank.
<br><br>"Humph, three pieces of trash dare to block the way, get the hell out of my way!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu waved his big hand, immediately causing Wu Yonghong's three faces to change drastically and collectively spit out fresh blood and flew backwards.
<br><br>But what Jiang Yu didn't expect was that just as he was about to move on, the three people who flew backwards actually flew over again and stopped in front of him.
<br><br>"Seeking death!"
<br><br>The cultivation level of the infinitely close to Martial Emperor exploded out fiercely and directly slapped a palm towards Wu Yonghong's three people.
<br><br>Under this palm, Wu Yonghong's three people felt their souls tremble, and before the attack reached them, they were spitting blood under the pressure.
<br><br>But even though they knew they couldn't resist, they still stopped in front of the martial arts school and didn't move, their eyes full of determination.
<br><br>In the nick of time, the sky smashed a pair of dung buckets, and then dung scattered long air towards Jiang Yu enveloped.
<br><br>Jiang Yu's face changed slightly, hesitated for a moment or drew back the palm of his hand, dodging the dung backwards.
<br><br>This directly saved Wu Yonghong three lives.
<br><br>At the same time, Lu Dasheng swept up, and Wu Yonghong three people stood side by side to together.
<br><br>"Dung, thanks a lot."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people looked at Lu Dasheng, revealing a touch of gratitude.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng nodded, and the four of them were on the same front, guarding the martial school closely.
<br><br>"Another martial daddy!"
<br><br>In the distance, Shu Qinhua and the others were filled with incredulity.
<br><br>"Yes, this martial school is far from as simple as we thought, if it were usual, I'm afraid our two clans wouldn't dare to offend easily, but in front of Jiang Yu."
<br><br>The fifth formation sighed, filled with regret.
<br><br>Obviously, in front of Jiang Yu who was one step away from reaching Martial Emperor, it was useless to come with more Martial Dignitaries.
<br><br>"Damn, even a few ants rush to block the way, give me death!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu was completely enraged by Wu Yonghong four people, a finger outstretched, suddenly flooded with heavenly shadow, like a pillar like the sky, then towards Lu Dasheng four people routed over.
<br><br>Under this finger, the four people's scalp numb, was suppressed even the yuan qi can not use out, can only wait for death.
<br><br>"What a terrifying strike."
<br><br>In the distance, Shu Qinhua and the others also changed color.
<br><br>"Brother, there's a lot of commotion outside." Martial Hall utility room, the dog looked back outside and said softly.
<br><br>"Oh, a little trash to make trouble, regardless of him, continue to dig the pit." Skull said with a face full of care.
<br><br>"Oh, okay brother."
<br><br>The dog continued to dig the pit.
<br><br>And outside the mighty Lu Qingshan also felt, all fidgety, urgently will look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"You old man, why do you keep looking at me like that?"
<br><br>Yi Feng white glance at him, looking at the carvings in his hands is more and more feel satisfied, in the second heart, will be the sand eagle held into the hands, grinning up the mouth at the same time closed one eye.
<br><br>"biu!"
<br><br>Mouth dubbed, to the window to a shot!
