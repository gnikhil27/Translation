For all this, Wu Yonghong did not know at this time.
<br><br>They were just about to go back to the martial arts school, but found not far from the entrance, a wretched, cloaked, up and down emitting the stench of a person is picking at the corner of the wall, full of eager look at them.
<br><br>It was none other than Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>Looking at one with an even more terrifying breath than before, his eyes were filled with envy.
<br><br>Especially when he saw that the old ancestor of the green mountains have become unfathomable to him, the mood has turned into a mess.
<br><br>And they looked at this same colleague who picked the shit under Yi Feng, but also do not know what to say, although did not say a few words, but also looked strange and pitiful.
<br><br>Just do not know, what in the end he did something to make Mr. unhappy.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong sighed, patted his shoulder, and then walked into the martial arts school.
<br><br>"You, there's always hope!"
<br><br>Chu Mad Lion also comforted as he passed by.
<br><br>"Yes, go for it!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Sun Zhuge also gave him a cheer.
<br><br>When Lu Qingshan walked by, he shook his head and said in a serious tone, "I told you not to come, but you didn't listen to me, sir didn't give the word, you'd better take care of your shit!"
<br><br>Looking at the spirited and spirited one, Lu Dasheng straight feeling nose astringent.
<br><br>A good rainy day, always feel the eyes into the sand.
<br><br>Because Lu Qingshan and others went out for an hour, so when they came back, the eagle meat and roasted wolf legs were already done.
<br><br>It just so happened that the rain had also stopped completely.
<br><br>So, Yi Feng instructed them to set the table in the small courtyard behind.
<br><br>In the pot, the eagle meat was cooked with hot bubbles, such as chili, radish, and other side dishes were cooked and rolled up, giving off a burst of fragrance.
<br><br>And the wine in addition to wolf legs, Yi Feng also got two plates of peanut rice.
<br><br>Looking at this full table, Wu Yonghong and other people's eyes are bright, rubbing their palms is already impatient, but without Yi Feng's word, they did not dare to move chopsticks.
<br><br>Looking at the old men who were restrained, Yi Feng smiled faintly and said, "They are all acquaintances, there is no need to be so polite with me, if you are obsequious, I will not welcome you next time."
<br><br>Hearing that, Wu Yonghong several old man body instantly trembled.
<br><br>One by one, they nodded their heads like chickens pecking rice.
<br><br>At the same time, his heart was also full of respect for Yi Feng, such as Mr. cultivation, in front of their juniors, not only did not put up the slightest stance, but was so easy-going.
<br><br>Such as Mr. this state of mind, if they can have a millionth, I'm afraid the achievement is not only this ah!
<br><br>"Come, come, come, I have good wine!"
<br><br>At the time of the breakthrough just now, the old ancestor of Castle Peak emptied his Castle Peak Sect's inventory and put bottles of good wine on the table.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled with appreciation, but stared at the old men and said with a smile, "But drinking is drinking, you old men are not allowed to give me slippery ah!"
<br><br>"Dare not dare."
<br><br>The people nodded their heads in a hurry.
<br><br>In fact, without Yi Feng's reminder, they did not dare to play any slippery, such as using cultivation to force the wine or something.
<br><br>Otherwise, not to mention that the gentleman will not be pleased, really use cultivation to drink, who can drink than Yi Feng?
<br><br>And in the small courtyard of the martial arts school when the atmosphere is a warm, red sun lineage of more than 20 experts is already pressure air and come.
<br><br>That aura was surging to the extreme.
<br><br>"Oh my god, look!"
<br><br>"So many experts."
<br><br>"Hoo, what kind of people are these, to be able to fly in the air, they must be at least at the cultivation level of Martial Spirit!"
<br><br>Their appearance caused countless old people and cultivators on the ground to exclaim.
<br><br>However, for these mole crickets on the ground, they were completely unconcerned, and instead, they pressed straight to that martial hall.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang, according to the tracking means Qingcheng placed on Ao Qing before, Ao Qing should not be in the martial hall right now." A person next to him reported towards Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>"One Ao Qing is nothing." Ao Bi Fang said in a cold voice: "It is because of this martial arts school that it has been able to jump so far, so it is not too late to settle this martial arts school first, and then to clean up that Ao Qing."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>At these words, the crowd nodded their heads solemnly.
<br><br>Not long after, that small martial hall had appeared in front of the crowd's eyes.
<br><br>At the same time, they saw from above the martial school with a condescending gaze that there were quite a few people drinking in that martial school, seemingly completely unaware of their arrival.
<br><br>In fact, it was not.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong several people's gaze had long since changed.
<br><br>However, looking at Yi Feng smiling and eating wine and food, completely without that look, sharp gaze also quietly restored, vaguely mobilized aura once again converged.
<br><br>Mr. here, some curmudgeons which turn to worry about them?
<br><br>After all, the previous two demon clans is a lesson learned from the past ah!
<br><br>"Sir, I'll drink to you."
<br><br>Thinking of this, several people raised their glasses and continued to toast towards Yi Feng in a warm atmosphere.
<br><br>"Didn't even notice this?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's gaze twitched.
<br><br>But remembering the previous lesson of Xiu Luo and Fu Dao, he still didn't take the enemy lightly, but transmitted a voice towards the crowd, "Spread out with the Heavenly Wolf's Formation and stand by, then listen to my order to attack at the same time, make sure to deal a fatal blow to those few people from the Martial Hall."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>With a command, the experts of the Red Sun lineage scattered in all directions.
<br><br>Subsequently, their bodies were filled with demonic Qi, some formed a formation, some made a complicated hand seal, and some of their natural attacks were already brewing.
<br><br>At one time, various attacks had already coalesced out.
