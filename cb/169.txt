"Good idea!"
<br><br>"Capture Ao Qing directly."
<br><br>"Yes, we are no match for the people of the martial arts school, but can't we handle Ao Qing?"
<br><br>An enthusiastic voice rang out, also let the crowd all see the hope.
<br><br>Under the blow of the martial arts school just now, they themselves were holding their anger without a place to vent it, and now when they talked about catching Ao Qing, they all became stupidly excited.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang, according to the tracking under Qingcheng, Ao Qing is not only not in the city, but also far away from the city, he should be on the other side of the Shifu Mountain Range, among the 100,000 mountains!" That subordinate said towards Ao Bi Fang.
<br><br>"In the hundred thousand mountains?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's pupils shrank slightly and said in a cold voice, "But it's okay, after all, for us, the farther he is from the martial school the better it is for us!"
<br><br>After saying that, he waved his palm.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>With his command, the many experts of the Red Sun Clan drove off towards the Hundred Thousand Mountains. Even though they had hit a wall when attacking the martial arts school, they were absolutely confident this time. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After all, this is a gathering of the top battle power of the Red Sun lineage.
<br><br>This lineup, still can not catch Ao Qing a waste?
<br><br>How is it possible!
<br><br>But one hundred thousand mountains and Pingjiang City also has a not short distance, even Ao Bi Fang and other people rush, also need a lot of time.
<br><br>And in the martial hall.
<br><br>Still overflowing with wine, drinking that is called a lot of fun.
<br><br>Especially the old ancestor of Castle Peak brought are not ordinary wine, plus the people do not dare to use the cultivation to drink, so some down, in addition to Yi Feng is still okay, the other four old man has become drunk.
<br><br>Especially the old ancestor of Qingshan, but also crossed his fingers, stepping on the small broken steps, told the past of the affair.
<br><br>"I'm telling you guys, not to blow, when I was young I was so handsome, the young girls who liked me at that time could form a line." The old ancestor of Green Mountain rose red and blew a cowl.
<br><br>"Cut, look at you like that, when you were young can be good to where, even if there are looking at you, afraid also Wang Biao look at green beans." Chu Mad Lion said with a face full of disbelief.
<br><br>The old ancestor of green mountain eyes glared, red face said: "Put your mother's fart, I green mountain is the kind of bragging person? I'm not afraid to tell you, once I even one imperial thirty-six!"
<br><br>"Thirty-six?"
<br><br>The crowd was shocked, even Yi Feng was a bit of an exception.
<br><br>Men.
<br><br>Drinking a little wine and blowing off steam is normal, right?
<br><br>"Tell me quickly, tell me quickly, how did you do it then." Sun Zhuge pushed and said.
<br><br>As soon as his words fell.
<br><br>All the people opened their ears over.
<br><br>"Ahem!"
<br><br>Seeing that everyone was so interested, Old Ancestor Qing Shan boasted.
<br><br>From the beginning to the result, from the top of the head to the tip of the toe, from the vision to the details were almost described all over, even he himself did not know how much exaggeration was mixed in.
<br><br>It was a full half an hour before he finished.
<br><br>"That, are you able to teach me?"
<br><br>Just at this time, the door of the room next to him, coldly came a voice.
<br><br>The crowd looked, only to find that Zhong Qing had already woken up, put together a small head picking at the door, and do not know how long there eavesdropping.
<br><br>When speaking, the little mouth did not forget to lick the lips, the eyes of the old ancestor of the Castle Peak depicted the scene is all the yearning.
<br><br>"Little brat, all do not learn, do not hurry to me to fall asleep!"
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately glared at him, scolded in a good-natured way, but also with a trace of happiness on his face, his little disciple, finally woke up ah!
<br><br>On hearing this, Zhong Qing's little head shrank in a hurry and lay back down nimbly.
<br><br>Zhong Qing's appearance did not spoil their atmosphere.
<br><br>Since the old ancestor of Qingshan, the other old men also began to blow up the bull, while also spitting out their old stories.
<br><br>For example, Lu Qingshan was good at loli and had scattered his family's wealth for loli.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong was beaten half to death when he was young because he was fighting for women, and was dropped in a cesspool for half a month.
<br><br>Sun Zhuge is a child peeking at the village flower next door bathing, if the shadow if the line of the case, looking at the white back reaction, until the man turned around to find the fucking village flower that dad, making Sun Zhuge future years of no interest in women.
<br><br>As for the Chu wild lion, but clean and white with a piece of paper, so people have to wonder if he likes men, leading to the presence of several people can not help but move the stool away from him.
<br><br>"Sir, I wonder what story you have, can you tell us?"
<br><br>After some sputtering, Lu Qingshan asked cautiously toward Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing this, the rest of the few people also looked over expectantly.
<br><br>"I ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, put down the wine glass in his hand, raised his head and slightly recalled: "I don't have any special story, if I had to say so, it would be in another world!"
<br><br>"Another world?"
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>As soon as this kind of information bomb fell, several people fiercely hit a jolt, the wine were directly awakened.
