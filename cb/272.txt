The next day.
<br><br>Hanchang City is unprecedentedly lively.
<br><br>Because today was the day when the first family of Hanchang City, the Ye family, and the second family, the Yun family, tied the knot.
<br><br>Although Hanchang City was only a small city in the entire South China Sea, this event was definitely a big deal for the people of Hanchang City.
<br><br>Yun family.
<br><br>Lights and decorations, seemingly a festive, but the whole cloud family heart a gloomy.
<br><br>What kind of person Ye Wuchen is, the Yun family knows very well, marrying Yun Mengtian to him is simply pushing him into the fire pit.
<br><br>But because of the Ye family's persecution and threats, the Yun family is no way.
<br><br>In fact, purely from the family strength and heritage, the cloud family than the Ye family is not much worse, but the key is Ye Wuchen's brother Ye Tianzhi in the blowing snow Villa as a small captain.
<br><br>Blowing Snow Villa, for a family like the Yun family and them, is simply a behemoth, and with this layer of relationship, the Ye family is the absolute hegemon of Hanchang City.
<br><br>In the room. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yun Mengtian's pretty face was covered with teardrops and was filled with haggardness.
<br><br>"Mengtian, why don't we not get married, I'll go talk to the Ye family." Looking at Yun Mengtian in this state, Yun Sheng's heart was not feeling good and said with a red face.
<br><br>"No father."
<br><br>Yun Mengtian hastily stopped him and said, "If I don't marry, the Ye family will definitely hold a grudge, and there will be no place for my Yun family in Hanchang City in the future, even for the sake of the hundreds of people in our Yun family, I have to marry!"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"It's all my fault for being useless!"
<br><br>Yun Sheng sighed heavily, hanging his head in despair, and his eyes turned red.
<br><br>If it wasn't for this, how could he have pushed his daughter into the fire.
<br><br>The auspicious time had arrived.
<br><br>Ye Wuchen of the Ye family, wearing a big red robe and riding a white horse, led a long procession, banging gongs and drums to receive Yun Mengtian into the palanquin.
<br><br>All this.
<br><br>How harmonious it looks.
<br><br>Especially in front of the white horse riding Ye Wuchen, face overflowing with a strong smile.
<br><br>Yun Mengtian this little girl he can miss for a long time, this time is finally taken down.
<br><br>When I think of tonight's wedding night, the corners of his mouth can not help but raise ...... hey hey hey ......
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>The triangular fork in the road ahead, suddenly came a loud noise.
<br><br>A large group of people stood in the middle of the road, twisting and turning in a magical dance.
<br><br>At the head of the group, was an obese woman.
<br><br>Feet on a pair of long rain boots, the lower half of the body wearing a short red skirt, you can clearly see on the exposed legs, with coarse leg hair, the upper half of the body is buttoned with a small revealing dress, but due to obesity, the whole dress will be held up tight bang.
<br><br>"Come on the left side with me to draw a dragon, the right side to draw a rainbow ......"
<br><br>Just see him shouting slogans while waving the red handkerchief in his hand, following the beat and fluttering the ponytail on top of his head.
<br><br>This eye-catching scene immediately made Ye Wuchen look over, but when he took a closer look at the woman's appearance, his eyes widened.
<br><br>The lips were painted with a red circle, and the face full of rouge was similar to the batch of layers of ash, but could not hide the bad skin.
<br><br>"What an ugly woman!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen straight shiver, feeling disgusted dry vomit.
<br><br>But at that moment, the fat woman turned sideways and cocked her buttocks, palms gently, while fiercely throwing a winks at Ye Wuchen, pouting the red and thick lips.
<br><br>Above the lips, still clearly visible unpicked clean beard.
<br><br>Mua mua mua mua ......
<br><br>"Wow ......"
<br><br>"Woo ......"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen's body churned and vomited directly.
<br><br>Hastily yanked the reins of the horse, deflected the white horse away from the direction, cursed with a black face and shouted, "What a fucking bad luck, go this way go this way."
<br><br>Saying that, the bridal party went towards another road.
<br><br>In fact, the other road is closer, but compared to the original road, it is much narrower.
<br><br>And seeing this, the fat woman dancing showed a smug smile.
<br><br>The procession, as always, walked forward.
<br><br>It was a long street, and the sides were full of people watching.
<br><br>But at that moment, there came a voice crying out.
<br><br>Then he saw that an old man with a limp leg holding a cane, directly stopped in front of the leader, Ye Wuchen.
<br><br>"You, you, you, Ye Wuchen, you have a cruel heart, you have knocked up my daughter and want to turn your face away, you you you you ...... must give us a statement today."
<br><br>The old man, holding his cane, stopped in the middle of the road and shouted with a red face.
<br><br>This scene, immediately attracted the attention of everyone, have revealed a meaningful color, crowded towards this side.
<br><br>After all, no one can escape the law that likes to read gossip.
<br><br>"Who are you, old man, don't spout blood!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen blackened his face and shouted.
<br><br>"You, you actually still do not recognize, daughter you quickly come out." The old man shouted with a trembling body.
<br><br>At the sound of his voice, the fifth Changkong burst out from the crowd, but at this moment he was dressed up in a pavilion, changed into a female outfit, originally a beautiful man in this outfit, he really had a few charming colors.
<br><br>Just see him with a hand to support the pair of buns attached to the chest, shouted: "It is you, it is you, at that time you said that this life is not I will not marry, but now turn around and marry someone else, you, you negative hearted man."
<br><br>"Ooooooooooo ......"
<br><br>"Everyone, come and do something for me!"
<br><br>The fifth Changkong's soft voice spread throughout the room, that pitiful appearance is really provoking many people's desire to protect.
<br><br>As soon as his voice came out, the crowd instantly heated up, and finger-pointing sounds came out towards Ye Wuchen.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Wuchen's face was dark.
<br><br>Although he did not put these farting people in his eyes, but this kind of thing happening on the big day would also have a great impact on his Ye Wuchen's reputation, immediately, he jumped off his horse and walked towards Fifth Changkong.
<br><br>"What are you, don't give this young master a bloody mouth." Saying that, his palm came out and grabbed towards the fifth long empty's chest.
<br><br>Fifth Longkong didn't dodge either, allowing him to grab it.
<br><br>Ye Wuchen was just about to make an effort, but felt that something was wrong.
<br><br>A subconscious squeeze.
<br><br>His face changed.
<br><br>"You actually ......"
