"Don't worry, senior, I will do a good job!"
<br><br>Lu Chong said respectfully.
<br><br>"By the way, do you know that the Great Harmony Sect has expelled you from the sect?" Gong Chen asked.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Lu Chong's face changed and he shouted, "Why?"
<br><br>"It's not because they think you've offended the Heaven's Immortal Hall and want to throw away relations with you." Gong Chen laughed coldly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Lu Chong clenched his fists tightly.
<br><br>Although his spiritual root was crippled and his cultivation was not good.
<br><br>But all these years, he had been working diligently for the Great Harmony Sect, and he never thought that he had only been locked in for less than a month, and the Great Harmony Sect had expelled him from the sect.
<br><br>For good or ill. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Wait for him for some more time ah.
<br><br>"Because of this matter, so I just now I spoke with Qing Huan Xiang Chief Steward, later I will go to talk to Chief Steward Lu, seven days later you will return to the West Ning Immortal Continent with me, let them this group of things take a good look at how wrong the decision they made in the first place!" Gong Chen clenched his fist and said.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Lu Chong clenched his teeth.
<br><br>His eyes gradually turned red.
<br><br>He had waited for this day for I don't know how long he had waited.
<br><br>Even before, he didn't even dare to think that he would have the day to rise against the heavens.
<br><br>Unable to help himself, he looked in the direction of the martial school and bowed solemnly.
<br><br>He understood.
<br><br>The fact that he had all this was given to him by the master of this island.
<br><br>Knowing that he would be able to return in a few days.
<br><br>So for the next few days, he worked to the limit, picking dung from dawn to dusk, lifting it from thirty to sixty quintals.
<br><br>And the realm soared to the Reincarnation Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Because of this island.
<br><br>Everywhere can increase his cultivation.
<br><br>Even a breath of air, smell the smell of dung, eat a grape can be raised.
<br><br>Here.
<br><br>What cultivation bottleneck, what spirit root deficiency, that is not a matter.
<br><br>Seven days later.
<br><br>He arrived at the mouth of the teleportation array, and Gong Chen prepared to teleport back.
<br><br>Just about to start the teleportation array, Yi Feng held a teapot in one hand, a fan in the other, and with a pair of homemade sunglasses, he came down under the scorching sun to observe the progress of the facilities in all aspects.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng, Gong Chen's face was overjoyed, and he quickly patted Lu Chong next to him, shouting, "Chong'er, quickly, quickly meet the gentleman."
<br><br>When Lu Chong saw this, he was startled.
<br><br>He had stayed on the island for exactly one month, and had only heard of Yi Feng's name, but had never actually seen him.
<br><br>At this moment, he saw it.
<br><br>He hurriedly knelt down to the ground.
<br><br>"Wow, young man is polite, get up."
<br><br>Yi Feng picked him up and smiled lightly.
<br><br>Seeing being helped up by Yi Feng himself, Lu Chong looked flattered.
<br><br>This gentleman, it turned out, was so down-to-earth that he couldn't help but respect him even more.
<br><br>"Old Gong ah, this young man you what person ah!" Yi Feng saw that the two seemed to have a shallow relationship and could not help but gossip.
<br><br>"Back to you sir, it's my senior nephew!" Gong Chen said respectfully.
<br><br>"Senior nephew, huh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>That was really tragic.
<br><br>The senior uncle was shut in, and the senior nephew was also in.
<br><br>"Also counted old acquaintances, the first time to see your senior nephew, there is nothing to give, eat a candy!" Yi Feng lightly smiled, took out a candy from his pocket and handed it to Lu Chong.
<br><br>Lu Chong looked at the candy handed to him by Yi Feng, for a moment did not know what to do.
<br><br>Gong Chen was the first to react and kicked Lu Chong in the buttocks.
<br><br>"What are you still standing there for, why don't you quickly thank the gentleman."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, thanks a lot sir."
<br><br>Lu Chong took the candy and hurriedly bowed.
<br><br>"You guys get busy, I'm going to take a nap." Yi Feng took a small sip of tea, waved his hand and said lazily.
<br><br>"Respectfully send off sir."
<br><br>After seeing Yi Feng leave, Gong Chen excitedly said, "Hahaha, Chong'er, you are so lucky, maybe sir knows about you and came to send you some big chance on purpose!"
<br><br>"Can sir even know about me?" Lu Chong couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Bullshit, your little shit, the gentleman can calculate it with a pinch of his finger." Gong Chen drank: "Hurry up, quickly eat that candy and see what effect it has."
<br><br>"Wow, how about we each have half?"
<br><br>Lu Chong asked.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Gong Chen licked his tongue, although very eager to eat, but the thought of sharing food with a junior, it is a bit not very good, so he waved his hand and said carelessly, "I do not need it, after all, you are a junior, this opportunity you alone take better."
<br><br>Seeing that Gong Chen insisted on this, Lu Li nodded and looked at the candy in his hand with a look of anticipation.
<br><br>Subsequently.
<br><br>One bite will eat it.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>His body plate has been, a breath of air straight to the clouds.
<br><br>In just an instant, he broke through from the Reincarnation Immortal Realm to the True Element Immortal Realm.
<br><br>"I nima?"
<br><br>Gong Chen looked, his eyes straightened.
<br><br>Before he could react.
<br><br>Another whoosh.
<br><br>A direct breakthrough to the late stage of the True Origin Immortal Realm.
<br><br>And perhaps it was because Lu Chong could not withstand such a great force, most of the remaining energy dissipated in mid-air, otherwise, Lu Chong broke through to a realm that was unimaginable.
<br><br>"Grass ah!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Gong Chen almost cried, "I should have known that I would not end up with what the master uncle frame, how must also break half to eat ah!"
