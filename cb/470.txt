Half a month later, a group of people finally walked outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun, who was sitting inside the carriage, lifted the curtain and looked outside.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Her pupils shrank, looking dead ahead at an old man who came with a cow.
<br><br>The old man was dressed in cloth, patched, and looked like he was hobbling, but in fact every step was as steady as a rock.
<br><br>"Strong man, very strong very strong ......"
<br><br>"I didn't expect to see such a strong person in such a place!"
<br><br>"And it's still an immortal!"
<br><br>Su Yunyun's eyes showed an incredible look.
<br><br>Moreover, she perceived that this immortal in front of her was not an ordinary immortal, but in no way comparable to that kind of low-level Human Immortal Earth Immortal.
<br><br>If it was in the previous life, she might not put him in her eyes, but this time is different, especially after having died once she understands more about being cautious. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>So she understands that right now this kind of character absolutely can not be provoked, or to avoid the good.
<br><br>"Pull over!"
<br><br>She said in a hurry.
<br><br>Qing Huan phase looked at her and ignored her, but turned her gaze to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Stop the car!"
<br><br>Yi Feng commanded softly, then turned his gaze to Su Yunyun and couldn't help but ask, "What's the matter?"
<br><br>"Pull over and make way for that old man."
<br><br>Su Yunyun said in a deep voice.
<br><br>While speaking, Su Yun Yun Yun completely concealed her own aura and hid among the carriage.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>It was because she was afraid that this old man would see her identity and lead to unnecessary trouble.
<br><br>Yo?
<br><br>Still respect the old and love the young.
<br><br>Yi Feng unexpectedly glanced at Su Yun Yun, also at the same time instructed Qing Huan Xiang to pull the carriage over, and then yelled at the old man leading the cattle: "Hey, old man, dressed in rags what for?"
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, Su Yun Yunyun, who was just sitting down inside the carriage, almost exploded and stood up violently from her seat.
<br><br>She was ready to open her mouth to remind Yi Feng not to make any disrespectful actions towards this old man to avoid any trouble.
<br><br>But never thought that before she had time to remind, such a voice came from Yi Feng.
<br><br>Called the old man directly, and said that others dressed in rags ......
<br><br>Know what others are?
<br><br>Know what other people are cultivation, what identity?
<br><br>How dare you speak so shamelessly, is not life?
<br><br>You really do not know the sky is high!
<br><br>The old man who heard Yi Feng's shouting heard the words and raised his head to reveal his wrinkled face.
<br><br>Then step by step, he walked towards the carriage.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Su Yunyun's nerves tensed up fiercely.
<br><br>Especially looking at the old man's deep eyes, her pressure suddenly multiplied.
<br><br>This damn mortal, obviously can avoid this person, not to produce any association, but the cheap mouth to come to such a sentence, will lead people over.
<br><br>Even if you want to die yourself, you actually have to drag her along.
<br><br>Now.
<br><br>I'm afraid it's difficult to make peace with it, right?
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Which immortal was called the old man, was said to be dressed in rags and not angry?
<br><br>Looking at the old man who was getting closer and closer, Su Yunyun was apprehensive, like an ant on a hot pot, the cultivation in her body was fully mobilized, ready to run away at any time.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The old man's next unprepared words choked her and she almost didn't gasp.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>The old man looked at Yi Feng with a smile on his face, politely passing out his voice and respectfully bowing his torso.
<br><br>This attitude, directly shocked Su Yunyun mouth enough to contain an egg, that exquisite face, flowing with a strong shock color.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What is this?
<br><br>She wiped her eyes, afraid that she had seen wrong.
<br><br>This strong man, in the face of Yi Feng's rudeness, instead of being angry, was actually so polite?
<br><br>Especially looking at the moment Yi Feng and the old man had a chat, she was even more incredulous.
<br><br>It looked like.
<br><br>Two people seem to know each other?
<br><br>And very familiar?
<br><br>The carriage resumed its journey, and it was not until the old man disappeared that Su Yunyun slowed down with hindsight, revealing a look of life after the robbery.
<br><br>Exhaling a breath of turbid air, she was busy asking towards Yi Feng again, "That old man, do you know him, who is he?"
<br><br>"That old man, huh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said lightly: "Know, cattle dealer, but what is called forget."
<br><br>"Peddler, cattle dealer?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun stared and smacked her lips.
<br><br>But in the blink of an eye, she reacted to what was going on.
<br><br>In her previous life as an immortal emperor, how can she not understand, there are many experts in order to improve the state of mind, or tired of fighting and killing life, will dive into the mundane, as a mortal experience mortal heart?
<br><br>Even in her previous life, she was ready to experience it some time.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>This must be the case.
<br><br>This old man in front of her is perhaps such a person, experiencing ordinary life in this small place, normal people do not know his real cultivation, and only she has special ability to see how powerful he is.
<br><br>Can't help it.
<br><br>She turned her gaze to Yi Feng.
<br><br>This guy, it was really lucky that he ran into a strong person who experienced a mortal heart, which saved him from a disaster.
<br><br>If it wasn't for that old man's reluctance to break the Mortal Heart, I'm afraid I don't know how many times Yi Feng would have died for those two rude words just now.
<br><br>The unaware are really fearless!
