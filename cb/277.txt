After a long, long time, Ye Wuchen finally escaped the poisonous hands of Bone Ben Wei and chased towards Ye Tianzhi.
<br><br>Unexpectedly, Ye Tianzhi was waiting for him halfway.
<br><br>Seeing Ye Tianzhi, Ye Wuchen, with a bitter face, hurriedly asked in a voice: "Brother, brother, why did you suddenly leave ah, didn't you say you would help me finish off that group of scum ......"
<br><br>But just as his voice fell, he found Ye Tianzhi smashing his fist towards him with a black face.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen flew out backwards, clutching his chest and asked, "Brother, brother what's wrong with you, I'm your brother!"
<br><br>"You shut up!"
<br><br>Ye Tianzhi could not rest in anger, grabbing Ye Wuchen and blasting him with a fist to the head.
<br><br>At this moment, he is really a belly of fire.
<br><br>Just now, he had gotten the news that the Snow Blower Villa had expelled him from the mountain.
<br><br>No need to think, must also have nothing to do with this matter. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Brother, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen asked morosely.
<br><br>"Still asking me what's wrong, do you know who that group of people are?" Ye Tianzhi hissed.
<br><br>"Who is it, isn't it just a bunch of trash?" Ye Wuchen shouted, holding his head.
<br><br>"Garbage, I'll let you garbage." Ye Tianzhi kicked one foot after another and sullenly bellowed, "Li Shuhua is trash, the fifth Tianming is trash, Yun Haotian is trash, the Martial Emperor is trash, and the high person who eats Demon Emperors is trash ......"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen was like a thunderbolt rang in his head.
<br><br>Associated with what Ye Tianzhi just said and the appearance of running away before, he also finally woke up and understood what.
<br><br>For a time, stuck in his throat, half a sentence could not be said.
<br><br>Face, filled with a strong fear.
<br><br>But he could not figure out how, such a group of big shots, how to catch him robbing his relatives ......
<br><br>A day later.
<br><br>A heavyweight news in Hanchang City spread around.
<br><br>The Ye family left all their properties and fled Hanchang City overnight. According to some people, they left in such a hurry that their pants were left hanging in the yard without time to collect them.
<br><br>The most confused belonged to the Yun family.
<br><br>Originally surrounded by the Ye family, was at a loss as to what to do, Ye Tianci with Ye Wuchen ran to kowtow a few heads and left trembling.
<br><br>If the Ye family had not disappeared from top to bottom, I'm afraid they would have thought there was a fraud.
<br><br>On the main road.
<br><br>Yi Feng and his party slowly driving through.
<br><br>But the team was not as large as before.
<br><br>The Yun family had spread the news that the Ye family had run away, so Zhong Qing took Yun Mengtian back to the Yun family, intending to stay there for a while. And those of his fans also went back for the time being because of an urgent matter.
<br><br>This is not, things are settled finished, Yi Feng plans to take old man Wang and others to take a good stroll around.
<br><br>After all, it has been so long to focus on the rush, but also did not take a good look at the local customs.
<br><br>And it happens to be spring again, think of it as a spring tour.
<br><br>"Old Wu, how is the map you were told to buy?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Sir, here is the map of the whole Nansha, you see where you want to go for a stroll." Wu Yonghong took out the map and laid it in front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>The others, too, came over.
<br><br>"How about it, where do you guys want to go?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>The people shook their heads and said, "It's fine if sir decides, sir decides."
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head helplessly, and then looked his gaze at the map.
<br><br>To be honest, Nansha was really big, what they saw all the way here was just the tip of the iceberg of Nansha.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the map carefully, and after some observation, a unique marker caught Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>"What is this place?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked, pointing at the map.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, old man Wang came over and when he saw the place Yi Feng pointed to, his eyes popped.
<br><br>"First, sir, are we going here?"
<br><br>He lifted his head and asked with some apprehension.
<br><br>"Well, this place looks pretty close, I just don't know what it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>"Here, here ...... here is a special and peculiar place in Nansha!" Old man Wang said with a complicated expression, "And because of this place, it makes such a small place like Nansha have a notable reputation in the entire Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"Oh! So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head in a daze of realization.
<br><br>Tourist attraction.
<br><br>That must be right.
<br><br>After all, to be able to make a place famous in the whole continent, I'm afraid it's only that kind of big tourist attraction that can do it.
<br><br>"Okay, let's go here."
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately clapped his hands and said.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, old man Wang and the others' bodies subconsciously trembled and their expressions became extremely nervous.
<br><br>But looking at Yi Feng's firm appearance, they did not dare to express any other opinions.
<br><br>Perhaps.
<br><br>This place is not that special for Mr. I'm afraid!
<br><br>A group of people, after a small break, then embarked on the trip ......
<br><br>PS: tonight on a chapter, sorry ha, really got a plant nerve disorder, can not breathe, heartbeat has been accelerated, a day to experience a few days of near-death feeling, I recuperate two days, really sorry.
