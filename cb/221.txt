"The two of you are really too polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and then said, "But the kindness is appreciated, I've already found something to replace that zither string, so there's no need to bother you two."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>At those words, Shu Qinhua and Xue Qinzhu both had a huge change in their faces, and their hearts suddenly panicked.
<br><br>"Sir, you, you really don't need it anymore?" Shu Qinhua asked with a face full of panic.
<br><br>And Xue Qinzhu, who was on the side, also looked at Yi Feng with a face full of nervousness.
<br><br>"If you guys had brought it earlier, I would have used it." Yi Feng excused himself with a smile, "But now I really don't need it, so I appreciate the feelings of the two of you."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made the hearts of the two people sink.
<br><br>The expression was also filled with bitterness.
<br><br>Although this person's expression is still mild, but that sentence if it was brought to use earlier, but now it is not needed ......
<br><br>This is not obviously blaming them for dilly-dallying and not seizing the opportunity to send in time? Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Okay, okay!"
<br><br>Shu Qinhua responded with a downcast expression, her pretty face becoming bloodless.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu on the side was also full of atrophy and filled with remorse.
<br><br>"Oh yes, the grandfather next door to get ribs to eat, I have to pack and clean up to go over, the two of you if there is nothing to do, come back next time to sit?" Yi Feng looked at the sky and said slightly apologetically.
<br><br>Hearing that, the two people's faces are even more ugly.
<br><br>This is, directly give the expulsion order?
<br><br>Obviously, although Yi Feng did not obviously show it, but their dilly-dallying has caused Yi Feng's displeasure.
<br><br>Even, already impatient to contact them.
<br><br>"Then sir, we two will first leave." Book Qin Painting bowed slightly towards Yi Feng and exited the martial school with a face full of reluctance.
<br><br>Out of the martial arts school, found the sky fell goose feather snow, white snow-capped, beautiful.
<br><br>But the sky, and with it, became quite cold.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The sky is cold is nothing, more cold is the heart!
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu sighed a long sigh.
<br><br>Looking at the emotionally depressed Shu Qinhua beside him, Xue Qinzhu remorse.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Disciple, it's my master's fault, it's my master who didn't seize a good opportunity!"
<br><br>Shaking her head in a complicated manner with her head bowed, her intestines were tangled together in her heart with difficulty.
<br><br>She understood that this time it was indeed she who had sat on the well and watched the sky.
<br><br>At the same time, she also felt ridiculous for her own short-sightedness, actually thinking that this one's chance was not as valuable as the Heavenly Toad Silk itself.
<br><br>And because of her misjudgment, she lost a heavenly opportunity for nothing!
<br><br>But where she heard the words of the book qin painting, the first time with the heavenly toad silk rushed to, this chance is also ten to nine.
<br><br>The master and disciple walked out of the martial arts school with a long sigh.
<br><br>But just two steps away, Xue Qinzhu's footsteps gave a jolt.
<br><br>Tightly contracted pupils, looking not far away, walking an old man holding a walking stick.
<br><br>"This damn winter can be really unbearable, but what's mister still doing, he hasn't come by the hour."
<br><br>His slow footsteps stepped on the not too thick snow, while his mouth was muttering to himself as he walked towards them step by step.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu master and disciple just quietly watched the old man walking until he brushed past them.
<br><br>Finally, Xue Qinzhu remembered who he was.
<br><br>That once in the southern sand fame of the first casual cultivator, because the two cultivation has not been similar, so also her Xue Qinzhu centuries of deadly rival.
<br><br>Only a few years ago he suddenly faded into obscurity, never to be seen again, Xue Qinzhu only blurred the memory of this person.
<br><br>But I didn't expect to run into this person again here.
<br><br>And his name, Xue Qinzhu also called out.
<br><br>"Wang Daotian!"
<br><br>She shouted.
<br><br>While shouting, Xue Qinzhu's Half-Saint cultivation exploded out silently and pressed towards the old man.
<br><br>Sure enough, as Xue Qinzhu's voice shouted out, the old man, who was walking towards the martial arts school with his walking stick, gave a slight pause in his steps.
<br><br>The hunched body slightly inclined back, with the pair of hollow eyes measured Xue Qinzhu a glance, only then lightly said: "Xue Qinzhu, is it you?"
<br><br>"Naturally, it's me."
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu sneered, "I didn't expect it, right, we are really inimical, we ran into each other here."
<br><br>"Yeah, it's a bit of a coincidence."
<br><br>The grandfather smiled.
<br><br>Then suddenly his eyes changed, and a terrifying aura suppressed towards Xue Qinzhu.
<br><br>In this instant, Xue Qinzhu, who had just been overwhelmed with a half-saint aura, was instantly suppressed with his flames all but extinguished, his paws fiercely retreated a few steps, and his heart became filled with disbelief.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>"It's actually a martial emperor!"
<br><br>"How could Wang Daotian have broken through to a Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>Her heart set off shocking waves and her body trembled violently as she redirected her unbelievable gaze towards Wang Daotian.
<br><br>Only to see the old man has returned to his earlier state, hunched over, supporting the cane step by step, carefully up the steps of the martial arts hall, while his mouth while murmuring: "the age of the old man can still meet old friends, not easy ah, but the old man is not much time, no time to accompany old friends to catch up ......"
<br><br>The voice fell, he walked step by step into the martial arts school, did not look back again Xue Qinzhu a glance.
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu's heart was pounding.
<br><br>The terrifying pressure that Wang Daotian brought to her just now made her heart palpitate even now.
<br><br>What the hell is this?
<br><br>The two people who were once indistinguishable, one had reached the awe-inspiring Martial Emperor realm.
<br><br>While the other ......
<br><br>But still in the half-saint grinding, even this life can break the saint, are still only an unknown.
<br><br>And looking at Wang Daotian's appearance, it seems that he did not put this former opponent of hers in his eyes in the slightest.
<br><br>Even.
<br><br>Not bothered to say a word more to her?
<br><br>And can not raise the other party's half interest?
<br><br>Her face was ugly to the extreme, this feeling of being belittled made her very uncomfortable.
<br><br>Subconsciously gaze, redirected to the martial arts school.
<br><br>She is not a fool.
<br><br>With a little thought, she could tell why this former opponent was able to throw her so far away.
<br><br>It was this martial arts school.
<br><br>It was the unfathomable youth inside!
<br><br>It was what made a half-saint, in just a few years, leap from the fish to become a Martial Emperor, an existence that was enough to walk across the entire Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>Her anger attacked her heart.
<br><br>A mouthful of blood spat out.
<br><br>She should have been able to obtain such a chance today, but due to her own stupidity, she buried it with her own hands!
<br><br>"Master, how are you?" Despite the many emotions in her heart, Shu Qinhua could not help but blush with fear when she saw Xue Qinzhu in this state.
<br><br>"I'm fine, go back first, I want to temporarily hide in the sect ......"
<br><br>"Alas ......"
<br><br>A long sigh, the master and disciple two lost soul away, out of Pingjiang City ......
<br><br>PS: these two days are slightly slow, forgive me, because soon to come out of the comic, in confirmation of the comic persona and other adaptations of things, so sorry.
