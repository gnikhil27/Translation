These words stunned Liu Yan.
<br><br>For a moment she didn't know what to say, and could only watch Yi Feng walk towards the stage of life and death.
<br><br>Not a human immortal?
<br><br>Then what is ......
<br><br>Think of Yi Feng who had practiced the One Thought Finger in one ye.
<br><br>Liu Yan incredible.
<br><br>It was hard to ......
<br><br>is a deep hidden expert?
<br><br>Soon, Liu Yan shook his head to shake the thoughts in his head away.
<br><br>Unlikely.
<br><br>What would a great power go to the trouble of coming to her Sun Moon clan for? The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just to be a junior disciple of her Star Peak?
<br><br>This does not make sense.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Not far away, Guo Shijie looked at Yi Feng who was walking towards the life and death stage.
<br><br>And look at the serious face pursed lips silent Liu Yan, the corners of the mouth hooked up a treacherous smile.
<br><br>This time even if you kill Yi Feng, Star Peak also has no reason to find their own trouble.
<br><br>On the stage.
<br><br>Yi Feng swept through with a glance and his gaze fell on Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Guo Shijie looked at Yi Feng expressionlessly, as if he was looking at a dead man.
<br><br>Yi Feng also had no expression, he only stared at Guo Shijie, "Peak Master Guo, do you want to stand closer?"
<br><br>"Later you can watch your disciple's tragic death more clearly."
<br><br>Even though Guo Shijie knew that Yi Feng was bound to die today, hearing this statement from him still started a fire.
<br><br>But there were many people in the field, and he did not want to lose face for a human immortal to lose his attitude.
<br><br>So with a lift of his foot forward, "Fine, this peak master wants to see your death face clearly today."
<br><br>"Right! We want to see it clearly too!" Behind them, the disciples of Sun Moon Peak also indignantly said, followed by a swarm crowded to the front of the life and death stage.
<br><br>Liu Yan was in the back, tugging his fists up nervously.
<br><br>This human immortal ah human immortal ah, but really do not let people stop ah, good to live can not, but to make things so big.
<br><br>On the stage of life and death, they can not help him.
<br><br>This can be done ......
<br><br>Can we only watch him die in the hands of the Sun and Moon disciples? ......
<br><br>Just when Liu Yan was at a loss, Yi Feng spoke up.
<br><br>"Just you come up?"
<br><br>The leader of the blue-clothed man got on the stage and stretched out his hand to the golden halo of air hanging next to him. A golden seal fell in the palm of the man in blue's hand.
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's words, the man in blue looked at him and sneered, "Don't want me to come up? Too late! Hurry up and make the deed you!"
<br><br>Yi Feng also walked to the golden halo and stretched out his hand.
<br><br>While making the seal he looked at the other four people under the stage, "Where are they?"
<br><br>"They?" The man in blue rolled his eyes, "Do you think you can pick a weak one and get away with it?"
<br><br>"Even if they are the weakest of the four, killing you is as easy as slaughtering a dog!"
<br><br>Yi Feng took out his hand and looked at the golden mark on his palm.
<br><br>Touched it, the palm of his hand looks like a powder floating up.
<br><br>Lightly touched and scattered.
<br><br>This fucking seal is too perfunctory ...... he rubbed his palm together.
<br><br>"Next year today, is the anniversary of your death!" The leader of the blue-clothed man saw that Yi Feng did not say anything and was about to wave his arm to cast a spell.
<br><br>"Wait, wait!" Yi Feng raised his hand and hurried to stop.
<br><br>"What the hell do you want?" The man in blue spoke impatiently, "Fear of death before it's too late, now you want to beg for mercy, you dream!"
<br><br>"No, you misunderstood." Yi Feng said, pointing to the four people standing next to the stage and said, "What I mean is, let the five of you trash come together."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"What a big mouth!"
<br><br>"He actually?"
<br><br>The moment these words fell, it immediately caused the following to clamor.
<br><br>All of them were staring at Yi Feng.
<br><br>A Human Immortal, where did he get the breath to say that five Earth Immortal Perfections were trash?
<br><br>These words simply made even the crowd of disciples of Star Peak unlistenable.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, don't be impulsive!" Liu Yan couldn't help it at this time, and hurriedly went forward to try to stop Yi Feng.
<br><br>And Guo Shijie, who was so angry that he laughed, stopped Liu Yan with one hand.
<br><br>"Hey! What is Lord Liu Feng doing?" Guo Shijie pulled her back and said, "The matter between the disciples on the life and death stage, you as the peak master must not interfere. You don't even care about the rules?"
<br><br>"You let go, I can't just watch him die!" Liu Yan tried to break away from Guo Shijie to go forward.
<br><br>"You can shut up!" Guo Shijie blocked in front of Liu Yan and sneered without hesitation, "I just want him to die!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Liu Yan was furious, "He a child, why do you have to be so aggressive!"
<br><br>"What the fuck child, not formed so arrogant, formed still not digging my ancestral grave?" Guo Shijie said nonchalantly, "You just don't presume to save him. No one can save him when he goes to the stage of life and death!"
<br><br>Naturally, Yi Feng also saw the movement on Liu Yan's side.
<br><br>He didn't care, but just looked at the four dumbfounded people below the stage, "I said, you four losers come up together, don't you understand?"
<br><br>"Simply rampant to the extreme!" The five people's eyes had long been spitting fire.
<br><br>Have seen arrogant, but never seen no strength and still so arrogant.
<br><br>They also do not care what more to fight less to invite people to laugh, only one mind to press Yi Feng to death.
<br><br>Four people under the stage instantly swept on the life and death stage.
<br><br>And at this time, those Sun Moon Peak disciples under the stage, has long been this change angered.
<br><br>"Brother, kill him!"
<br><br>"Brother, kill him!"
<br><br>"Yes, beat him to death!"
<br><br>"Go for it, senior brothers!"
<br><br>A clamor came from below the field, and Yi Feng took out his ears.
<br><br>Five men stood on the stage and surrounded Yi Feng.
<br><br>With a movement of their fingers, weapons of various colors were directly offered.
<br><br>The moment the elder guarding the life and death stage shouted out the start, they would collectively attack, leaving Yi Feng in the dust.
