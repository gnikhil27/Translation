Surprisingly.
<br><br>The effect was so strong?
<br><br>Especially looking at Yun Xian Que and the fifth long air, originally a hair weaker than her strength, directly soared to the martial dwelling, which made her face as ugly as constipation.
<br><br>The top level of the chance she is not qualified to compete for is just, the rest of the chance actually also slipped through their hands for nothing.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Her intestines are regretting.
<br><br>If he had just gone to compete, it would have been her who had broken through the Martial Dignity.
<br><br>The martial daddy ah martial daddy ah.
<br><br>This is the realm of walking around in Nansha, ah, if she broke through the Martial Dignity, the future head of the Heavenly Sword Sect, may be directly passed to her ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, she became more and more reluctant, and her eyes were cast towards one of the points that were being contested.
<br><br>"You guys get the hell out of my way!" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Peng Xian'er martial sect aura burst out, the long sword in her hand cold aura forced.
<br><br>There are several contending cultivators saw this, revealing a face full of reluctance, but looking at Peng Xian'er's face full of threatening color, they could only forcefully hold back their anger.
<br><br>Looking at the mud on the ground, Peng Xian'er took a deep breath.
<br><br>This kind of behavior could never happen in her lifetime when she thought about it before.
<br><br>But in front of the opportunity to break through the Martial Dignity, she endured it even if it was more degrading.
<br><br>Under the veil, she gritted her teeth, grabbed a piece of wet clay and stuffed it into her mouth.
<br><br>But the next moment, her face suddenly changed.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>She violently shook off the dirt in her hand and swept the air and flew towards the river in the distance.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Fifth Changkong and Yun Xianque looked at each other and hurriedly approached to observe.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Suddenly, Fifth Longkong couldn't help but laugh out loud.
<br><br>"What's going on?" Yun Xian Que asked with a face full of bewilderment.
<br><br>"Pfft, this, this isn't even the soup Mister poured, it's urine!" Fifth Changkong held his stomach and laughed out loud.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's face slightly twitched animal, and then also couldn't help but cover her mouth and laugh.
<br><br>The!
<br><br>Tell her to just start pretending.
<br><br>In the following time, the cultivators present almost lifted the ground to the sky, and only then did they stop.
<br><br>And after the breakthrough, Li Shuhua and the others were even more full of joy, and the conflict just now seemed to be left behind.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, with this kind of gesture, this gentleman is definitely a Martial Immortal!" Yun Haotian sighed with emotion, "I just don't know, what is this gentleman's business when he comes to my Nansha!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd fell silent.
<br><br>This was also what they had guessed in their hearts.
<br><br>Such a strong expert, suddenly came to Nansha, if there is no purpose is impossible.
<br><br>Moreover, as soon as he came, he exploded an emperor grade demonic beast like the Giant Jiao not to mention, but also vaguely changed the pattern of the South Sand forces.
<br><br>For example, the originally powerful Heavenly Sword Sect was definitely at the bottom after their breakthrough this time.
<br><br>"Seniors."
<br><br>At this time, Yun Xian Que came up and said, "I once heard Lu Qingshan of Pingjiang's Qingshan Sect say that this gentleman is probably playing a big chess game, and Nansha, most likely, is an important part of his chessboard, so he is bound to be laying out something when he comes to Nansha this time."
<br><br>"Then according to you, then we are not a pawn in the middle?" Yang Tianyu exclaimed.
<br><br>"We should be."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que nodded his head and said, "But so what?"
<br><br>This question directly caused Yang Tianyu to smack his lips, and also caused the crowd to nod their heads.
<br><br>Yup.
<br><br>Even if they were his pawns, so what?
<br><br>Isn't that an honor?
<br><br>Thinking of this, the crowd is a little excited, because it does not necessarily become a pawn is a bad thing, perhaps accidentally may be destroyed, but at the same time also accompanied by a great opportunity ah!
<br><br>Looking at the direction of Yi Feng and others left, a group of people unspoken to follow.
<br><br>In addition to picking up the opportunity behind the butt, perhaps in Yi Feng's next action, speculate something.
<br><br>If you catch a little bit of a head start, that is the moment when the fish leap dragon gate.
<br><br>Two days later, after trekking through the mountains, Yi Feng and the others finally entered Nansha from the edge for real.
<br><br>"Several gentlemen, ahead of Jiayi City is where my Li family is located, do you want to go to my family to rest for a few days?" Li Yihan asked nervously.
<br><br>"In that case, would it not be too convenient?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a smile.
<br><br>"How could it be inconvenient, sir is too polite." Li Yihan said hurriedly, on the contrary was afraid that Yi Feng would not go, after all, Yi Feng and their kind of characters went to her family, I'm afraid is really able to pomp and circumstance.
<br><br>"Then thanks a lot!"
<br><br>Thinking about this sister is getting better and better, Yi Feng also readily agreed.
<br><br>After all, these days, have not slept a comfortable sleep, here a good rest and recuperation is quite good.
<br><br>A group of people walked into Jiayi City.
<br><br>Jiayi City is not big, not small, there are countless such cities in Nansha.
<br><br>And the Li family, in Jiayi City is also considered a famous family.
<br><br>Of course, this Li family is not the same Li Shuhua's Li family, but still far from it.
<br><br>The architecture is good.
<br><br>Quite some style of a big family.
<br><br>"Han'er, you've finally come back, father I missed you." At this time, a middle-aged man dressed in fancy clothes welcomed him.
<br><br>"Father, I made you worry."
<br><br>Li Yihan said softly, saying that he remembered the few people of Yi Feng and hurriedly introduced, "Sir, this is my father, Li Yuan."
<br><br>Then said towards Li Yuan, "Father, these are Mr. Yi, they are all my ...... friends, they have taken care of me a lot along the way."
<br><br>"So they are Han'er's friends, then please come in quickly."
<br><br>Li Yuan invited Yi Feng and his group into the living room and sat down.
<br><br>"Sir, may I leave first for a moment?"
<br><br>After coming to the hall, Li Yihan asked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because after her breakthrough, she had not been able to solidify her cultivation resulting in her cultivation level had been a bit unstable, but she did not dare to make a move in front of Yi Feng, so at this moment, she could not really suppress it, so she thought of going to solve her cultivation problem.
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and thought to himself that this sister is really too polite.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's smile, Li Yi Han lowered her head, ever since she knew Yi Feng's true identity, she had not dared to look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Before leaving, Li Yihan again approached Li Yuan and solemnly explained, "Father, I will leave first for a while, remember, make sure to help me receive Mr. and the others, remember, it is a must!"
<br><br>"Sir, I'll go first and come back later to accompany you." After saying that, she bowed towards Yi Feng again, and only then hastily retreated.
<br><br>Li Yuan, who looked at his daughter rather like a little woman acting, frowned slightly.
<br><br>Then he took a glance at Yi Feng, and his frown deepened.
<br><br>In addition to Yi Feng, does not look a decent person, what is more, he actually can not feel these people have cultivation.
<br><br>But remembering his daughter's reminder, he still didn't show anything, but asked, "Several people, I wonder which sect you are, and what cultivation level you are?"
<br><br>"Ah-ha, Family Master Li is polite, we have no clan or faction, just mortals." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Mortals?"
<br><br>Li Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>He had thought that these few people had cultivated some special technique, but he did not expect that they were really mortals.
<br><br>However, the family head's urbanity didn't let him show anything, but instead, he rolled his eyes and suddenly laughed, "Duke Yi, I am a straightforward person, and since Han'er is not here, there is something I need to say to you."
<br><br>"Please speak, Family Head Li."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>Slightly pondering, Li Yuan smiled and said, "As you know, as a father, one never wants the best for his daughter, and our Li family is a cultivation family, so I hope that Mr. Yi can keep some distance from our family Han'er."
<br><br>"Of course I do not mean to look down on Mr. Yi, it's just that mortals and cultivators are really ......"
<br><br>"So Duke Yi do you ...... understand what I mean?"
