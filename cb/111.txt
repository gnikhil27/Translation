"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>As the voice fell, the Eagle King's sharp claws slashed through, blood splashed everywhere, and the bodies of the two youths just now burst into flames.
<br><br>Also at the same time, countless demonic beasts rushed out from the mountains and forests and surrounded towards these people.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Many demonic beasts?"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd immediately showed panic, this dense demonic beasts simply to their scalps.
<br><br>The woman on the floor also changed her face, and the long sword in her hand came out, accompanied by a dense sword qi, a sword mane enveloped towards the Eagle King.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>The longsword landed on the sharp claws of the Eagle King, and instantly flashed out dazzling sparks. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Human, you will die."
<br><br>The eagle king tilted his head and cried out hostilely, his wings unfolded into a sharp sword and rushed high into the sky, then turned sharply down again, with a powerful aura enveloping towards the woman.
<br><br>The woman's pretty eyebrows frowned slightly.
<br><br>The long sword swept, turned into thousands of sword mane and then united, forming a stunning sword from the bottom to the top, straight stabbed out.
<br><br>In an instant, the sword aura in the field forced people.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>The two powerful forces collided together, immediately turned into a huge shock wave spread out, countless trees under the violent fluctuations, broken waist.
<br><br>The ground, at the same time, also set off a sky of dust.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>The eagle king under the power of this sword, mouth muffled grunt, huge body was shaken tumbling out, a few hundred feet away to stabilize the body, but the claws are still wounded by the sword, scarlet blood dripping down the high altitude.
<br><br>"Stomp stomp stomp ......"
<br><br>Also at the same time, the woman's jade feet on the ground, but only a few steps.
<br><br>Obviously, this collision she has the absolute upper hand.
<br><br>But her bright eyes are filled with gloom, although she has the upper hand, but the other disciples in such a huge group of demonic beasts attack, one by one should fall down.
<br><br>In less than a few moments, half of them had fallen.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>She frowned tightly, normally there were indeed many demonic beasts in this mountain range, but as long as they were avoided there would be no trouble, never would such a huge herd of demonic beasts gather.
<br><br>And the eagle that just attacked him, I'm afraid it's already at the Demon King realm!
<br><br>This kind of role, unusual situation will not appear.
<br><br>"Roar."
<br><br>Just as she was staring, along with a roar that shook the mountain forest, a mighty leopard swept out from the jungle.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>The earth trembled again as the Pig King's heavy limbs stamped on the ground and came impacting.
<br><br>"Two more demon kings?"
<br><br>The woman frowned tightly, and when she looked up, the Eagle King, who was injured but did not lose his fighting ability, also whistled in the sky and came galloping in once again.
<br><br>Almost without saying a word, the three demon kings launched a stormy attack on the woman.
<br><br>The woman is also not willing to show weakness, obviously a woman, but at this moment burst out with a compelling aura, the whole person as if into a sharp sword, to deal with the three demon king's attack is still comfortable.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah, help!"
<br><br>But however, those disciples came more and more screams, even though the woman wanted to rescue, but under the three demon king's attack, but simply can not get away.
<br><br>Finally, the last disciple fell down in front of the woman with a face full of fear.
<br><br>On the ground.
<br><br>Pieces of corpses.
<br><br>Blood stained the ground, and the pungent smell of blood enveloped the entire mountain forest.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>The woman's face was frosty, her heart trembled violently, these were all the elite disciples of her clan!
<br><br>"Humph, fighting with us and still dare to distract."
<br><br>At this time, the leopard king a cold laugh, with the wind of the huge claws whistling, the woman's face changed, holding a sword to block but it was too late, the small abdomen of the white dress shattered, leaving a horrific wound, immediately stained the shirt.
<br><br>She hurriedly retreated, bright eyes reluctantly looking at the pieces of corpses, red lips clenched shellfish teeth, into a stream of light to flee.
<br><br>"Chase!"
<br><br>The three demon kings looked at each other, obviously did not want to let the woman go because of her beauty.
<br><br>The woman is still stronger than the three demon kings in speed, after a chase, finally temporarily escaped their pursuit.
<br><br>However, her situation is still not optimistic.
<br><br>Due to excessive blood loss, a pretty face has become white, can only stagger dragging the injured body to rush. At the same time, her clear forehead had never been soothed.
<br><br>She had come all this way and found that the entire mountain range was littered with demonic beasts everywhere, not the least of which was the aura of other demon kings sweeping by.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Her expression was filled with doubt.
<br><br>This kind of thing was unprecedented.
<br><br>Seeing a small demon not far away, she held the purpose of solving her doubts, her ghost-like body flickered away, and her jade hand landed directly on the top of the small demon's head.
<br><br>Soul search!
<br><br>Along with the little demon's memory into the mind, her beautiful eyes flickering, red lips can not help but open more and more, and finally more surprised out.
<br><br>"How ......"
<br><br>"How can there be such a powerful person?"
