Wu Tian Empire, camp.
<br><br>A roaring bonfire lit up the dark sky.
<br><br>Next to the bonfire were rows of young people dancing neatly in a square.
<br><br>Behind them on the large open ground were thousands of small cows twisting their hips to the music.
<br><br>So lively.
<br><br>Next to the iron frame is still nuisance smoke.
<br><br>Next to the iron frame stood a small fat man, while wiping the sweat on his head while cheerfully grilling skewers.
<br><br>"Come on, eat the skewers!" The little fatty carried a plate of grilled meat and trotted towards a group of people.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin hurriedly took the plate and shouted, "Come, come, this is my newly cultivated dragon divine beast! There was an accident when it came out, deformed, and died in a few days, but it does not affect the taste, just for everyone to taste!"
<br><br>He said while distributing the roasted meat.
<br><br>"Open!" Wu Tian received a string of beef skewers, surprised: "This long extinct dragons, smell the fragrance to know that is not good, which does not have a little good Kung Fu can not grill this taste!" First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Brother good strokes, such a divine beast at will to cultivate, we are still no match for brother!" Bai Qi Yu said nibbled a mouthful of beef, and asked.
<br><br>"I do not know what the achievements of all the senior brothers and sisters have been recently?"
<br><br>"Shame shame shame, I just became the king of the Heavenly Dragon Kingdom. It's not as good as your senior brothers."
<br><br>"I'm even more ashamed, I just became the Mist Sect's patriarch and annexed the Yan Sect by the way. I am no match for you brothers."
<br><br>"What about the fifth senior sister?"
<br><br>"I am even more ashamed, but I just went to the immortal world to collect a few continents, and by the way destroyed a few continents that did not obey me, not as good as the brothers." Su Yun Yun said, also ate a mouthful of beef skewers.
<br><br>"Harm, I am more ashamed!" Wu Tian only shook his head as he listened, "Up to now, I have not fulfilled Master's expectation of beating the Cloud Top Empire."
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>A bunch of people are talking, only to hear a "senior brother and sister!" came from far away.
<br><br>A group of people looked over, only to see a person came forward and said: "The four guardians were captured by the king of the cloud top!"
<br><br>At the sound of the words, everyone froze in unison.
<br><br>Instead of being worried, they laughed out loud.
<br><br>"This Genting Empire, it's really, grabbing who is not good, but actually grabbing the four protectors!"
<br><br>"Come on, let's take advantage of this opportunity, let's also go and see the fun, and by the way, join forces with the Four Guardians, and take down the Cloud Top Empire right now!"
<br><br>"Good, let's go and destroy the Cloud Top Empire now!"
<br><br>Wu Tian was the first to stand up and shouted excitedly.
<br><br>A group of people led a large army towards the Cloud Top Empire and headed towards it in a vast manner.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Genting Empire, Imperial Palace.
<br><br>The Genting king and Perdition drank freely.
<br><br>"It's been so long, those four people behind the curtain are afraid that they have already lost their lives!" The Genting king said, laughing loudly, "Come, drink this cup!"
<br><br>"Will they not die?" Perdition put down the wine cup with some concern.
<br><br>To know that the killing formation even though that is several eras left extremely dangerous and powerful formation, but behind the curtain can so turn the hand into clouds and overturn the hand into rain existence, just by a killing formation to try to exterminate.
<br><br>Extermination is always a little worried.
<br><br>"Haha, you know how powerful that killing formation is." The Genting kingdom ruler said chestily, "Besides, even if they don't die, now that so many days have passed, they must have been tortured beyond recognition!"
<br><br>"Fuck!" Perdition was also in a rare happy mood.
<br><br>This time, as long as they take out this is a behind-the-scenes manipulator, their later things will be much simpler!
<br><br>"As long as they're gone, do we still have worries about getting our Qi filled behind us?" The Genting kingdom ruler confidently said, "Hahahaha, come on, in the dry!"
<br><br>The two were drinking happily when the voice of their subordinate came from afar, "Report!!!"
<br><br>"What report! Can't you see we are drinking here?!"
<br><br>The king of Genting kicked over his subordinate who had just entered the main hall.
<br><br>The two of them continued to drink freely.
<br><br>Not long after, there was a loud noise from outside, and the sound of swords fighting clearly reached their ears.
<br><br>The king of Perdition and Genting stopped the wine goblets in their hands.
<br><br>"What's going on?!" The Genting Kingdom Monarch and Perisher hurriedly walked out and saw a boiling rebellion not far away, interspersed with waves of smoke and dust rolling in the air.
<br><br>"Report back to Your Majesty, it's the people of Wu Tian Empire who are fighting over!" The subordinate said with trepidation.
<br><br>"Why didn't you say so earlier?!" The Genting kingdom ruler slapped the man and bled to death from his seven orifices.
<br><br>"Hey~" Perdition stopped the angry Genting Kingdom Monarch, "Don't be in a hurry."
<br><br>"We have all four of the people behind that manipulation, these little shrimps can become nothing."
<br><br>Destruction said carelessly, "Only that Wu Tian is a bit tricky. You and I will go ahead and join hands to seal him directly first, and when the qi is complete, then we will ask the messenger to use absolute kilometers to make him completely disappear into dust and smoke."
<br><br>Hearing the words of Perdition, the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch then extinguished his fire and nodded in response, "Makes sense."
<br><br>"Let's go, you and I will go out to meet those ignorant little children." After the words were said, Exterminating World's silhouette disappeared in a flash.
<br><br>The figure of the Genting king followed closely behind and also disappeared.
<br><br>Outside the Genting Imperial City, on the high city wall.
<br><br>The Genting Monarch and the World Destroyer were on the left and the right.
<br><br>The two looked at the dozens of people standing in front of the ten million troops below and froze in place.
<br><br>Hearts, too, were cackling and pumping.
<br><br>Because in front of these dozens of playing the lead, actually every one of them is more powerful than their fear of Wu Tian!
