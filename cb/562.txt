"So what do we do now?" Yi Feng opened his mouth and rightfully asked.
<br><br>What to do?
<br><br>The woman in red gave Yi Feng a look.
<br><br>Shaking her head, she seemed to have heard a very funny thing.
<br><br>Then lifted a step towards the side.
<br><br>Yi Feng crossed his arms and looked at the back of the woman in red extremely seriously thinking before he followed.
<br><br>"I am definitely going to find my way out. What are you going to do?" He said in a decisive manner.
<br><br>This shitty place was something that he had been transported here by his own bad luck.
<br><br>He had only just come to the Immortal Realm, there was no way he would wait here to die.
<br><br>The woman in front of him could be in the Immortal Realm, for one thing, her cultivation level must be above his own.
<br><br>Even if you can't use your cultivation here, but she is definitely more aware of the immortal world than yourself. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>If you can convince the woman in front of you to join forces together, to find the way out, is certainly more convenient than their own alone.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi, who was walking in front, did not return his head, but only spat out two words from his mouth.
<br><br>"Wait to die."
<br><br>"Ah this ......" Yi Feng stopped in his tracks and looked at the back of Jiang to.
<br><br>For a moment speechless.
<br><br>The Jiang to in front of him also stopped in his tracks and turned his head to look at Yi Feng, "You may not use magic power here, you are merely a human immortal cultivation, be good to yourself."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>"Don't worry, I won't wait to die."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi choked.
<br><br>"I know I'm just a trash cultivator, and I know I can't use my magic power here." Yi Feng also gradually accepted the truth and calmed down.
<br><br>He looked at Jiang Zhi, "Maybe to you, I'm just a trash similar to a mortal."
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>"I've never lived off of mana."
<br><br>"Goodbye."
<br><br>Yi Feng turned to leave, raised his hand and waved at Jiang to behind him, "See you later!"
<br><br>Looking for a companion who preaches negative energy all day long waiting to die is better than no companion at all.
<br><br>Jiang to a motionless, watching Yi Feng's figure until far away.
<br><br>Long time, Jiang to expressionlessly turned his head. Continue to walk in the direction of their own.
<br><br>Do not use cultivation, and still want to live.
<br><br>The sky is a nightmare.
<br><br>As for walking out of the Shadow Island.
<br><br>A fool's dream.
<br><br>Never possible.
<br><br>And Yi Feng, after leaving the altar, headed west.
<br><br>As for why, with his own sense of. Always feel that the west side of the sea. Where there is the sea, always better to live.
<br><br>The sea was not found, and halfway, Yi Feng met a wolf pack.
<br><br>It was a wolf pack, but there were only three wolves. Because the mutation was extremely strange.
<br><br>At the head of the pack was a wolf with two heads.
<br><br>Next to it, there were two wolves with one head.
<br><br>The head wolf has a bull's horn and a mane of sharp claws with purple eyes.
<br><br>"Gollum ......" Yi Feng's stomach suddenly rang out.
<br><br>The three wolves looked at Yi Feng fiercely, showing their teeth and grinning, saliva flowing from the corners of their mouths.
<br><br>He hurriedly covered his stomach and explained, "Misheard misheard, I don't want to eat you guys."
<br><br>In the immortal river continent hunting leopards, killing eagles, that is the mortal continent.
<br><br>This immortal world ...... can go to the immortal world ...... on their own this can not use magic trash, how can have the ability to hunt and kill.
<br><br>Can not dare can not dare ......
<br><br>Just Yi Feng's explanation did not let the three head wolves let him go.
<br><br>The head wolf is now staring intently at him, the predecessor bent down and has made a sprinting posture.
<br><br>With a low whimper, the two wolves next to him went around to both sides of Yi Feng without moving, blocking Yi Feng's retreat.
<br><br>The three wolves surrounded Yi Feng in a group.
<br><br>Yi Feng began to drum in his heart.
<br><br>Damn, he won't die here today ......
<br><br>He also did not move to pull out the dagger he had been carrying.
<br><br>He pulled out the dagger, which was still stained with his own blood that had long since dried up.
<br><br>He stuck out his tongue and wiped the dagger blade over it. After licking the blood on it, he squeezed the dagger tightly in his hand.
<br><br>His eyes were like falcons staring at the three wolves in front of him, ruthless and resolute.
<br><br>It was too late! In the nick of time, the wolves on both sides fiercely tore over with a swift momentum!
<br><br>The head wolf also roared and leaped up, and its sharp teeth pounced on Yi Feng with coldness.
<br><br>Yi Feng's body was on one side, and he quickly slashed through with a knife.
<br><br>But in the blink of an eye, there were three wolves' corpses in front of him.
<br><br>One knife one.
<br><br>Yi Feng ready to escape from the gap of the body also stopped.
<br><br>He was also ready to attack while drawing his body to a safe place, to defend as an attack.
<br><br>I didn't expect ...... a knife in one hand.
<br><br>Just this???
<br><br>Yi Feng who reacted sneered, "That's it?"
<br><br>"I thought how strong it was." He walked over and kicked at the dead corpse of the head wolf, "The posture is so scary, and thought how strong it is, cut."
<br><br>Saying that, he squatted down and started to peel the skin and cut the flesh.
<br><br>"Also, didn't they say you can't cultivate here." Yi Feng murmured, "Then that means that the animals here are not much different from the mortal world."
<br><br>It should be the immortal world water and soil is different, look strange long point.
<br><br>Yi Feng cut off the meat of the three wolves one by one, cleaned up and ate part of it over a fire, and put the rest in the storage ring.
<br><br>As for the wolf skin, Yi Feng put away the skin of the head wolf intact.
<br><br>Here the wind and sand are too strong, his clothes have long been blown to tatters.
<br><br>This wolf skin can be used as clothes, wear it to block the sand and wind.
<br><br>After handling the wolf meat and draping the head wolf skin, Yi Feng continued to head west.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>The wind blew through, and I don't know how long had passed.
<br><br>A fiery red figure came out of the sand.
<br><br>The silhouette is getting closer and closer.
<br><br>Jiang to a miserable white face, these days she had an extremely difficult time in the dark shadow island. The animals that survive here have been baptized by the power of rage.
<br><br>People can not cultivate here, those animals that have adapted to the berserker force can.
<br><br>Than the cultivation of immortals, these animal thieves more terrifying.
<br><br>Because of the cultivation in the berserker force, these animals are brutal and bloodthirsty.
<br><br>If you meet, without cultivation can only be a sheep into the tiger's mouth. As for the use of cultivation ......
<br><br>For example, she is now, this time in order to deal with a lot of met mutant animals, the use of magic by the berserker force backfire.
<br><br>Not only affect the cultivation, the slightest carelessness will be a tragic death.
<br><br>So she has not dared to use the cultivation to. Can only open grain to barely survive.
<br><br>Jiang to slowly out of the sand and wind.
<br><br>And close, she saw the bones on the ground.
<br><br>Here corpse bones all over the ground, there is nothing strange, after all, those are human corpse bones.
<br><br>But she looked at the corpses of the Shadow Wolf on the ground and was shocked.
<br><br>Other animals needed to be baptized by the berserker power to survive on this Shadow Island, and then mutate to adapt to the environment.
<br><br>But the Shadow Wolves were different. They were born here and grew up here.
<br><br>Every blade of grass, every stone, every wind, every grain of sand, and even every trace of violent power on Shadow Island is the reason why they can become strong.
<br><br>On this island, the Shadow Wolves are the true overlords.
<br><br>It is no exaggeration to say that they dominate the life and death of people and things on Shadow Island.
<br><br>Except for pack fights, there is almost no power that can make them die here.
<br><br>If the pack struggle ...... Jiang to look around the.
<br><br>In addition to the corpses of the three wolves no more.
<br><br>Pack struggle, there must be more than just the corpses of the three wolves.
<br><br>Not to mention the corpses, at least there would be blood stains shed by other Shadow Wolves.
<br><br>Instead, here it looked like there were only the corpses of three wolves, and blood stains ......
<br><br>Could it be that ......
<br><br>A thought appeared from his own mind, and was quickly dismissed by Jiang to.
<br><br>It was impossible for someone to kill a Shadow Wolf, especially a fierce fury Shadow Wolf like the head wolf.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi squatted down and wanted to check the wounds of the three wolves.
<br><br>Unfortunately, once the two wolves' fur was lifted underneath, not to mention the wounds, even most of the good meat was shaved off. Just the bones were still intact.
<br><br>As for the head wolf, besides the meat, even the skin was gone.
<br><br>Looking at the boiling traces still left next to it, Jiang Zhi understood that someone must have been here before himself.
<br><br>They had picked up the wolf meat and skinned the head wolf by hand.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi swallowed his saliva, and after a little thinking, he picked up the bones on the ground, walked to the place where there was firewood before, and pounded them.
<br><br>For the first time in a long time, Jiang Zhi had enough to eat.
<br><br>Then got up and walked towards the distance.
<br><br>Yellow wind mixed with sand particles blowing, scraping Jiang to face raw pain.
<br><br>She couldn't help but think of the youth who said he was leaving Shadow Island.
<br><br>The human immortal strength, in this hell-like Shadow Island, should have died long ago.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get your own personal information.
<br><br>Even if the name is like grass, did not give up the hope of living.
<br><br>It is admirable.
<br><br>But so what ......
<br><br>Countless dead bones on this ground, all kinds of high-level immortals are endless, not to mention the human immortals ......
