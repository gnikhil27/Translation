Milk Leopard Li looked at the three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest and said seriously, "Three great commanders, first of all, let alone whether I can untie it, even if I have the ability to untie it, I can't help you untie it!"
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin said in bewilderment.
<br><br>You should know that right now Bonehead and the others are leaving, but it's a heavenly opportunity!
<br><br>"Because if I unseal you guys privately, Lord Bones will be unhappy!" Milk Leopard Li said.
<br><br>The three demons of Rhinolyn were stunned.
<br><br>Then Rhinolyn couldn't help but laugh: "Leopard Li, it's already this time, so stop joking and hurry up and try to help us unseal it!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, leopard Li, in front of that dwarf for the greater good pretend to forget, do not really become that dwarf's subordinates?"
<br><br>"Time is urgent, hurry up and lift the seal, otherwise when the dwarf ones come back, we will not be able to leave."
<br><br>Rhinoceros Miao and rhinoceros earth at the side also hurriedly urged.
<br><br>However. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li, however, slackened her face and looked at the three demons of Rhinoceros Lin, frowning and asking, "So what the three great commanders you just said means that you are not sincere in your defection?"
<br><br>"Of course we didn't defect."
<br><br>"That is, why should we defect to that dwarf and that human, just because they are a little better than us?"
<br><br>"Yes, and we were captured by him, we were controlled by him, but even if he had captured our bodies, he couldn't capture our hearts."
<br><br>"Defection, it's impossible to defect, it's impossible in this life."
<br><br>"We are demons of the Western Demon Forest, with dignity, how will we submit to a small dead spirit?"
<br><br>In a moment, the three demons turned red and emitted their firm voices.
<br><br>"I didn't expect that the three great commanders you actually, actually think like this!" Milk Leopard Li said with a pale face, "Originally, I thought that the three great commanders you guys were also sincere and surrendered with me in general."
<br><br>And hearing Milk Leopard Li's words, the three demons, whose faces were full of determination, were suddenly dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Leopard Li you ......"
<br><br>"You you you, you actually ......"
<br><br>For a time, they trembled, their palms pointed at Milk Leopard Li, and a painful voice came out.
<br><br>The three demons never thought that what Milk Leopard Li showed in front of Bones Ben Wei was actually all true and not pretend.
<br><br>"You, you really let us down too much."
<br><br>"That's right, how can we, the great demons of the Western Demon Forest, be playthings in the hands of others?"
<br><br>The three demons immediately emitted angry voices.
<br><br>The fire of excitement in their hearts was also completely doused at this moment.
<br><br>Never thought that the opportunity that was so easily expected, the only milk leopard Li as a bottom card, actually really became the opposite.
<br><br>See the situation.
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li was immediately anxious and hurriedly explained, "Three great commanders, this is all after my deep consideration, I really implore you, together with the defection."
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"You don't have to say it again, the way is different!"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin snorted coldly at once.
<br><br>"Not bad, trying to get us to defect is impossible!"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Miao and Rhinoceros Tu also emitted the same firm voice.
<br><br>"Three great commanders, you are confused!"
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li said bitterly, "This is an opportunity for our Western Demon Forest, and for you three, it is also a great opportunity that is heavenly, how come you not only don't grasp it, but also throw it away with your own hands?"
<br><br>"What bullshit chance opportunity?"
<br><br>Rhinoceros Lin coldly said: "That dwarf and that human strength is indeed terrifying, indeed strong, but how strong can it be, and what chance can it bring us?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Milk Leopard Li responded with a complicated face, "Three great commanders, it seems that you know nothing about their strength!"
<br><br>"What don't you know?"
<br><br>"Isn't it just a little stronger?"
<br><br>"But how much stronger can it be."
<br><br>"That's right, strong is just like that, can't break the sky, can't make our western demon forest increase a few demon immortals in vain?"
<br><br>For a time, the three demons cold disdain sound constantly, the face showed a vow not to yield the look.
<br><br>PS: First of all, I wish you all a happy new year, happy family, the new year we all must be cattle cattle cattle oh!
