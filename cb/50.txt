The demon's spirit is like a lost soul at this moment.
<br><br>Eyes are red.
<br><br>The first time I saw the film, I couldn't lift my footsteps, and at the same time, there was a strong fear.
<br><br>She was so sure that the two brothers were already dead that they could not even collect their bones.
<br><br>And this martial arts school in front of her looks ordinary, but conceals an absolute killing machine, a place that eats people without spitting out their bones.
<br><br>"Poof!"
<br><br>Finally, her anxious fire attacked her heart and she spurted out a mouthful of blood, her long jade hand propped up on the wall next to her, a bewitching face filled with a miserable white color.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was giving command to Zhong Qing to clean up, happened to see this scene and hesitated for a moment towards Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>"Girl, how are you?"
<br><br>Easy Feng showed a gentle smile and asked softly, he guessed it was the daughter of which family on the street was sick, the neighborhood, and could help then help a little. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The demon Ling'er wiped off the blood from the corner of her mouth and looked up with a jerk, and instantly saw the face of Yi Feng.
<br><br>She instantly changed her complexion, her face was so pale that her feet took two steps backwards in fear.
<br><br>This face, although indicating ordinary, even with a gentle smile, seemed to her that behind this smile was another face of fear.
<br><br>She had not forgotten that it was this man who had instructed the boy to use the swift cloak to wipe the dust, and it was this man who had taken the bones of her windless brother as a pet's ration, and I was afraid that the shocking stone at the door that was used to fill the steps was also this man's arm.
<br><br>The devil!
<br><br>This is the definition of Yi Feng in her mind.
<br><br>"Is it really okay, why don't you come into my house and have a seat?" Yi Feng asked with concern.
<br><br>"No, no, no, no need." Once she heard Yi Feng call her into the house, Demon Ling'er's pretty face changed greatly, full of panic, not caring about the heavy trauma caused by the anxious fire attack, dragging her heavy feet to leave in a hurry.
<br><br>Now, she only wanted to escape from this place, only wanted to escape from the sight of this human, only wanted to quickly return to Xuanwu Sect and report what happened here to Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"Do I look so scary?"
<br><br>Looking at Demon Ling'er's hurried footsteps, Yi Feng touched his face, filled with confusion.
<br><br>And after leaving Yi Feng's place, Demon Ling'er rushed back towards the Xuanwu Sect almost non-stop, and when she returned to the Xuanwu Sect, even with her cultivation level, she was close to being deflated at this moment.
<br><br>The disciples of the Xuanwu Sect were surprised to see this anxious and wretched appearance of Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>Usually to them, Demon Ling'er is the personal disciple of Ning Xuanwu, high above the world, beautiful and wise at the same time, where have they ever seen her in such a panic and disoriented look?
<br><br>The news of Demon Ling'er's return quickly reached the ears of the top brass, so when Demon Ling'er rushed back to the main hall, all the top brass, including Ning Xuanwu, were already waiting in the main seat.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu locked his eyebrows, his eyes pressed against Demon Ling'er, looking at this appearance of Demon Ling'er, a bad premonition also appeared in his heart.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>"Senior Brother Wudu and Senior Brother Wufeng he ......"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's eyes were red, her demonic body trembled and trembled, and the fear in her eyes had not subsided up to this point.
<br><br>"What happened to them!?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's pupils shrank and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"The two senior brothers have been killed by that person from the martial arts school." Demon Ling'er's voice trembled with grief and anger.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When they heard the words, the faces of the Xuanwu Sect's people, including Ning Xuanwu, all changed greatly.
<br><br>"Then how did they, exactly, die?" Ning Xuanwu held back his anger, and with a hoarse voice, he asked word by word, "I want you to tell me all the details that you know!"
<br><br>"I don't know." Demon Ling'er shook her head sadly, "But all I know is that there are no bones left in Brother Wudu's corpse, and that only Brother Wufeng cultivated the divine power of the sect and still has a bone left."
<br><br>As soon as Demon Ling'er's voice fell.
<br><br>The whole hall fell into a dead silence. It can be said that the whole Xuanwu Sect, except for Demon Ling'er, the two of them are the future hope of Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>But now the two came together and there was only one bone left.
<br><br>This news is too great a blow to the Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>"What's even more abominable is that Senior Brother Wufeng has to be humiliated after his death, and the only bone left is still used by that person as his pet's ration." Demon Ling'er clenched her red lips and said with a voice full of hatred, she felt unable to breathe when she remembered the appearance of that dog holding the bone in his mouth.
<br><br>That was the senior brother who grew up with her!
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>Once this news fell, Ning Xuanwu was equally unable to maintain his composure, and a palm fell, and the stone table next to him instantly turned into smithereens.
<br><br>A monstrous anger spread through him.
<br><br>It is simply too much to bully people!
<br><br>Two of his own disciples died so tragically, and after their deaths, they were treated as pet food, which was a great shame to him, Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>This slap came down, causing everyone to not dare to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>"Then, where are my two treasures?"
<br><br>Finally, Ning Xuanwu asked in a deep voice again, and at this moment, only Ning Xuanwu's voice was left in the whole hall.
