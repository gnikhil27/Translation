"You forget it, you are a bad old man, but you will get killed if you go." Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>This old man.
<br><br>Really do not know the sky is high.
<br><br>This thing between cultivators, you a broken bad old man run to dry grips ah, then die do not know how to die.
<br><br>Qing Shan old man's heart is tight.
<br><br>Especially to hear that sentence will send life, his heart are raised, fortunately came to ask the gentleman ah!
<br><br>He got up and bowed towards Yi Feng, "Thank you sir for reminding me, Qingshan still has some things to do, so I'll take my leave."
<br><br>After saying that, he immediately rushed back to the clan.
<br><br>Outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Several figures fell from mid-air.
<br><br>At the head of the group, was a woman in white, her face was absolutely beautiful, her figure was beautiful, this posture was absolutely the best on earth. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>On the left, is a gray-clothed old man, the appearance looks ordinary, but the body unintentionally leaked breath can be seen, this is an absolute expert.
<br><br>The markings on the clothing of the two people can be seen, it is the people of the South Sand Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>The woman at the head of the group is naturally also the proud daughter of the Wind and Cloud Valley, Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>"Uncle Lin, what about Wu Chang'an?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que frowned and said.
<br><br>"Alas, he's still at the back, I think." The old man called Uncle Lin sighed and said.
<br><br>"This is a big matter, you and I don't know if we can get out in one piece, I really don't know, why would the valley master let me bring him here, a Martial King but, won't it cause us trouble." Yun Xian Que said coldly, obviously full of dissatisfaction with this Wu Chang An.
<br><br>"Alas, Holy Maiden, please forgive me."
<br><br>Lin Lao sighed with a complicated expression, "In fact, Wu Changan's talent is very good, but I don't know why he doesn't cultivate his strength properly, instead, he stays in the sect behind closed doors, making those strange side techniques all day long, what kind of body doubling techniques, earth transport techniques, I don't know what use they have."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que had a cold face, obviously not the slightest interest in talking about this person.
<br><br>Finally, when the two people were almost out of patience waiting, only then did a figure fly in slowly.
<br><br>It was Wu Chang'an.
<br><br>Youthful-looking, not too tall, not too thin, clean-looking.
<br><br>But stopped a hundred feet away from them.
<br><br>"Wu Chang'an, what's wrong with you?" Yun Xian Que said in a cold voice, "If you don't want to go, then get the hell back."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What she didn't expect was that just as her voice fell, Wu Changan turned around and swept into the air, flying out of sight in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que froze in place, her face turning blue with anger, heavily chopping her jade feet, and chased after her with Lin Bo's face full of reluctance.
<br><br>Although she did not want to take this burden, but the wind cloud valley master has long given her a deadly order to take Wu Chang'an to see, she really let Wu Chang'an run back alone, back will certainly be reprimanded by the valley master.
<br><br>But what one didn't expect was that even though she and Lin Bo both pursued with all their might, they found no trace of Wu Chang'an.
<br><br>Even after searching around, there was still no trace.
<br><br>"How could a tiny Martial King evaporate out of thin air?" Yun Xian Que was filled with disbelief.
<br><br>Lin Bo was also full of bewilderment.
<br><br>He was a Martial Exalted, but he actually let a Martial King slip away under his nose.
<br><br>It was really strange.
<br><br>"Forget it Uncle Lin, let's ignore him for now, Jiang Yu's graveyard is important, let's rush to the Castle Peak Sect first!" Yun Xian Que frowned and said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Uncle Lin nodded, thinking that Wu Chang'an should be able to be safe and sound by himself.
<br><br>Because sometimes he always felt that Wu Changan was a bit evil as a person.
<br><br>Or maybe it was just good luck?
<br><br>But couldn't say exactly.
<br><br>Then the two swept out of the air and rushed towards the Castle Peak Gate.
<br><br>And a few moments after they left, a head emerged from the earth.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>Wu Changan looked at the two people who were far away and let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"This woman is so beautiful, she must be a redhead, inevitably there will be suitors, with suitors there must be competitors, with competitors there will definitely be conflicts, in addition to this tomb ......"
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"It's too dangerous!"
<br><br>"With my current strength, if I were to take on a martial sect, the other side would also have a one in a million chance of taking my life."
<br><br>"If there is also a Martial Dignity, then it would be even worse ah ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Wu Changan tightly frowned, his body could not help but shiver.
<br><br>Martial Zun experts according to the strength of the initial calculation, I'm afraid there is a one in 10,000 chance to kill him.
<br><br>"This kind of risk, can not be involved!"
<br><br>After some consideration, Wu Changan's heart immediately made a decision.
<br><br>He was just about to go back to his home when his footsteps gave another beat.
<br><br>"But it's not good to go back to Windy Cloud Valley!"
<br><br>"There are more and more things in the sect, there are tasks, there are all kinds of cause and effect, there are countless dangers, it seems that the wind and cloud valley can not go back, can only find a place to live!
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Why is there always so much trouble in life, it's not good to live your life in peace?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an sighed and looked at the Pingjiang City in front of him, his eyes slightly lit up.
<br><br>"This city belongs to the edge of the South Sand, the experts inside think necessary weak quite a lot, Gou in this city should not have so much trouble."
<br><br>Making up his mind, he walked towards the South Sand City.
<br><br>Just then, a bee flew in, and he subconsciously waved his hand to slap it to death.
<br><br>But the next moment, he shuddered violently.
<br><br>"Careless, getting into trouble!"
<br><br>He looked down at the bee's corpse, and a drop of cold sweat flowed from his forehead.
<br><br>The bee was a swarming insect, which meant it was bound to have companions, in case one of the companions cultivated into a demon and grew up successfully ......
<br><br>That 10,000 years later, it is likely to help his former companion revenge ah, then, for him is a big trouble!
<br><br>Thinking of this, a fear rose in his heart.
<br><br>The face was suddenly cold.
<br><br>"In that case, it is only to cut off the grass to eliminate the root!"
<br><br>After saying that, his killing intent was all over the place, and his sharp gaze began to sweep around, finally finding the honeycomb, and his powerful attack blasted away, destroying it instantly.
<br><br>Counting the bees on the ground and confirming that there were no missed fish, he let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Whew."
<br><br>"Almost got into another deadly trouble."
<br><br>"In this world, it's not easy to live, if only I could find a big brother to cover me, I could live until the end of my life."
<br><br>"Alas!"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an slowly walked towards Pingjiang City, on the way can try to avoid the crowd, finally entered the city.
<br><br>PS: Two more chapters in the second half of the night.
