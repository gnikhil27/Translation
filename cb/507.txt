After half a month of searching, Burial One finally found the flyer and successfully joined the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>After entering the Heaven and Earth Sect, he was no exception, soaking in the Book Collection Pavilion with the other four brothers all day long.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Come and see."
<br><br>Just then, Burial Three held a picture jade slip in his hand, and an excited voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The rest of the people were also busy to put their heads over.
<br><br>Then they saw that the picture jade slip presented a picture.
<br><br>Among the gusts of wind, accompanied by a magic sound, faintly see five heads wearing bowler hats, dressed in solemn black dress black men appeared.
<br><br>The leader of the man holding a scepter.
<br><br>The four men behind him shouldered the black coffin. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Under the magical music.
<br><br>They cooperate tacitly and move neatly.
<br><br>Sometimes they got down, sometimes they twisted.
<br><br>"Tao."
<br><br>"Tao, look at it, brothers is our Tao, is the Tao we have been looking for."
<br><br>Burial Five exclaimed loudly.
<br><br>And the rest of the brothers also trembled with the same excitement.
<br><br>Because Burial Five was right, with just this one glance, they decided that this was the Dao that belonged to them.
<br><br>This feeling is mysterious and mysterious.
<br><br>It is easy to tell if it belongs to you or not.
<br><br>And this dao in front of them can be said to be tailor-made for them.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The five brothers watched the picture of the black man carrying the coffin over and over again, and each time they watched, they had a deeper understanding.
<br><br>At the same time, their strength was advancing by leaps and bounds.
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>Burial Two's jade brief lit up.
<br><br>It turned out to be a letter from a close friend who was also in the Chaos Hall.
<br><br>It asked why the five no longer comprehended the Immortal River Chaos Tablet and if there was any hidden agenda.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>Burial One asked.
<br><br>"Big brother, it's Bai Yao, he asked about why we left the Chaos Grand Hall, and I was wondering if I should tell him about the Heaven and Earth Gate as well, so he can come over as well." Burial Two said hesitantly, "After all, Bai Yao and we brothers have always been good friends, what do you think?"
<br><br>"En, Bai Yao and we do have a good relationship, I think we can indeed pull him over if we can."
<br><br>Burial Three also nodded similarly.
<br><br>Bury One and Bury Four turned their gazes towards Bury Five.
<br><br>After all, although Burying Five was the oldest five, he had now become their main backbone instead.
<br><br>Who told him that he was now the senior brother of the four.
<br><br>"My Heaven and Earth Sect never hides things, and we as disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect should be the same, so what's right is right." Burial Five said, "So it doesn't matter if you tell him, except that if you want to join the Heaven and Earth Sect, you still have to see if he has a flyer."
<br><br>"Of course, it doesn't matter if there are no flyers, it's better to come to the island to pick up some trash and mix up some opportunities than to enlighten that whatever Immortal River Chaos Tablet."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Burial Two nodded his head.
<br><br>Then he told Bai Yao what he had seen and heard about the Heaven and Earth Gate, as well as the strength of the five people today.
<br><br>Bai Yao was amazed by what he heard.
<br><br>His heart began to stir.
<br><br>Although it was unbelievable to become a Xuan Xian in one month, he knew the character of the five Black Fei people and there was no need to lie to him.
<br><br>Furthermore.
<br><br>Now there was still a long time before the Immortal River Chaos Tablet opened.
<br><br>What's the big deal about going to take a look.
<br><br>So the next day, Bai Yao, who was in the Blue Immortal Pillar, set off, and he was not the only one who visited the Heaven and Earth Gate this time.
<br><br>Bai Yao has always loved to make friends, not only did he have many friends when they entered the Chaos Hall together, but he also made several friends after entering the Chaos Hall.
<br><br>Therefore, this time, he called all his friends.
<br><br>There were more than ten of them.
<br><br>In two days' time, Bai Yao had brought more than ten friends to the island.
<br><br>Although none of them had a flyer, after they got on the island, more than ten people without exception were ready to settle on the island.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>What one did not expect was that Bai Yao's best friend still had a best friend, and his best friend still had a best friend ......
<br><br>In just a month's time, there were 50 or 60 people on the island of the Heaven and Earth Gate, making the now large Chaos Hall, which had long become loose.
<br><br>In the middle of the Chaos inner space.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan knelt on the ground, trembling and shivering.
<br><br>"Waste, you dead waste, what's the use of having you?"
<br><br>"Spending a big price to make you a heaven-determined person, you are not half useful, and in a month's time, instead, you have made people less by dozens?"
<br><br>The exterminating pressure came, causing Teng Xiyuan to kneel on the ground emitting a miserable scream.
<br><br>"My Lord, I was wrong, I was wrong, I was really wrong." Teng Xiyuan desperately begged for forgiveness, his forehead sweating coldly.
<br><br>"I ask you, with so many people missing this time, have you inquired about any clues?" Perdition asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Lord I, I, I have been in the immortal pillar relying on the breath emitted from the Immortal River Chaos Tablet cultivation, the moment I opened my eyes people disappeared, I I I ......"
<br><br>The shivering voice came out from Teng Xiyuan's mouth and greeted him with another big mouthful.
<br><br>"You waste, I let you become a heaven-defined person for what?"
<br><br>"For you to blend in and inquire about some information I don't know, who let you cultivate in the immortal pillar?"
<br><br>"You motherfucker still closed?"
<br><br>The more he said, the more angry he became.
<br><br>Originally to his status, would not have lost his temper so much, but looking at the only so many people left in the hall, he was dying to slap Teng Xiyuan to death on the spot.
<br><br>He has planned several eras of the big game ah.
<br><br>All of this is the heart and soul ah!
<br><br>"My lord, I was wrong, please forgive me, give me another chance, I know what to do next." Teng Xiyuan knelt on the ground and kowtowed, said with a face full of determination.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"Get the hell back to me right now, give you another month, if you still haven't poked around, then you can go to hell!" A deep voice came from the extermination.
<br><br>Teng Xiyuan shuddered and hurriedly retreated.
<br><br>PS: Continue to code in ha, in addition to thank you all for your blessings yesterday, love you.
