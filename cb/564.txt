Jiang Zhi looked at the end of the black sea with a deep gaze.
<br><br>And then looked at Yi Feng who was in good condition.
<br><br>It was a stark contrast to his weathered and very haggard self.
<br><br>"Have you not used your magic power since you came here?" Jiang Zhi couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, "Yeah. Didn't you say that using mana here would be backfired."
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi understood.
<br><br>It was only a human immortal, and the use of magic power here could not kill any of the mutant species.
<br><br>Rather because the realm is too low, the less the berserk power affects.
<br><br>"By the way, you are a mere human immortal, what did you commit to be exiled here?" Jiang Zhi asked again.
<br><br>This place was where the immortal world exiled felons. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>As for human immortals, there is nothing significant in the immortal world. The execution of a felony is.
<br><br>The reason why will exile to the dark shadow island?
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, slapped his thighs, his face was full of hatred and chagrin, "I was fucking transported here!"
<br><br>"What?" Jiang Zhi thought he had heard wrong.
<br><br>"The immortal world summoned me, I was randomly teleported up from the mortal world and arrived here!"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi looked at Yi Feng with wide eyes, full of disbelief.
<br><br>"This ...... you are joking with me?"
<br><br>"Who's joking with you." Yi Feng let out a long sigh, "Otherwise I'm a human immortal no matter what mistakes I made, I'm not qualified to come here, right?"
<br><br>"That's true." Jiang Zhi looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Only after a long time did she spit out two words.
<br><br>"Outrageous."
<br><br>"More than outrageous, it's simply inhumane!" Yi Feng hated. "This random is too random."
<br><br>"It's just that I've never heard of anyone being teleported here by an immortal summons."
<br><br>Jiang to said, his gaze downward, before suddenly reacting to the wolf skin he was draped in.
<br><br>"This wolf skin of yours ......" she eyed with surprise, "where did it come from?"
<br><br>Yi Feng also followed her gaze to his own body, "Oh, this ah, from a wolf stripped off."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi thought of something and asked, "Did you also eat that wolf meat?"
<br><br>"Yeah. How do you know?" Yi Feng asked rhetorically.
<br><br>"I thought it was you." Jiang Zhi returned, "On my way here, I saw the carcass of the wolf horse."
<br><br>She knew that someone had eaten the head wolf before her.
<br><br>Those who could hunt and kill the head wolf would never see the head wolf carcass to eat.
<br><br>"Then you have picked up a bargain." Jiang Zhi said.
<br><br>"That's not true." Yi Feng said, "I was hungry at that time, so I came across something to eat. It's also a coincidence."
<br><br>After chatting for a while, Jiang Zhi did not want to say more, so she said, "I'm leaving, see you later."
<br><br>Yi Feng saw that she had already decided, so he did not stay, "Okay, if you figure out to join forces with me to go out, come to me."
<br><br>Looking at Jiang Zhi's figure far away, Yi Feng threw the wolf skin on his body.
<br><br>"Poof", jumped into the sea again.
<br><br>In the afternoon, Yi Feng grilled the fish to eat.
<br><br>The familiar astringent taste spread in the mouth.
<br><br>Yi Feng habitually frowned.
<br><br>Still swallowed it.
<br><br>This fish he ate for a good period of time, but the flesh is really bad.
<br><br>Eating every day, eating every day, is really a bit tired of eating.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the wolf skin next to him and remembered the taste of wolf meat before.
<br><br>He smashed his mouth, picked up the wolf skin and draped it over his body, took out his dagger and walked towards the distance.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>It was getting dark.
<br><br>The wind and sand did not stop.
<br><br>A few people high in the shrubbery, a pair of red eyes bubbling with light.
<br><br>The eyes are not unanimous, looking at a young man with a dagger, cloaked in wolf skin, walking lightly into the shrubbery.
<br><br>Some of them had bloodthirsty eyes and fierce eyes, while some of them whimpered from their throats and retreated slowly with fear.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>After wandering around Shadow Island for some time, Jiang Zhi suddenly heard voices coming from the sky.
<br><br>Her gaze changed and she hurriedly headed towards the altar.
<br><br>Only to see a man coming out of the cage of the altar.
<br><br>Dying, covered with wounds.
<br><br>Jiang to hurriedly catch up to the altar, despite the repercussions of the berserker force, luck to heal the man's wounds.
<br><br>A mouthful of blood came out of Jiang Zhi's mouth.
<br><br>At the same time, the man gradually woke up.
<br><br>"Your Holiness ......" When he saw Jiang Zhi, he was about to get up and salute.
<br><br>"No need." Jiang Zhi pressed the man back, wiped the blood on his mouth and looked at him with a pale face, "How come you were summoned here too?"
<br><br>"My subordinates insulted my orders, I was found out." The man said, lowering his head in self-reproach.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi looked at the man, "Were you tortured by him with the Zexian Whip?"
<br><br>The man bowed his head and didn't say anything, sort of acquiescing.
<br><br>Jiang Zhi was furious.
<br><br>And then got up indignantly, "I always have to go back and clean him up!"
<br><br>"But this Shadow Island ...... us out?" The man asked, looking around in despair.
<br><br>Jiang to also calm down.
<br><br>"Anyway, we can't just sit around and wait for death." After thinking about it, Jiang Zhi said.
<br><br>"We have to survive on this island first." Jiang Zhi stood up, dizzy from the repercussions of the berserk power, and was fortunate to be supported by his subordinates.
<br><br>"How can we survive on this Shadow Island?" The man asked.
<br><br>"As long as you don't use mana." Jiang Zhi said, "Use the way of mortals, live."
<br><br>"In a mortal way? Don't we have to incarnate?" The man asked.
<br><br>"No need." Jiang Zhi said confidently, "Although this island is not a good environment, but there is no shortage of things to fill the stomach."
<br><br>The man wondered, "There are things to fill your stomach on this island?"
<br><br>"At the edge of Shadow Island is a black sea, which is rich in fishery, enough for you and me to survive." Jiang Zhi said decisively, "Come with me."
<br><br>"That's great!" The man who heard the hope of survival in a desperate place showed his face with joy.
