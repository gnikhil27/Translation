 Seeing this scene.
<br><br>Countless people watching the battle were shocked out of their teeth.
<br><br>A kitchen knife?
<br><br>Afterwards, there was even a burst of teasing laughter from the direction of the Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>"A chopper, what a laugh."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, yes, the armament of the titled Old Ancestor of Castle Peak is actually just a chopper."
<br><br>"The Castle Peak Sect can't have fallen to this level, right, this Castle Peak Ancestor can't be holding a kitchen knife from their Castle Peak Sect's back kitchen!"
<br><br>The crowd of the Qingshan Sect also looked ugly one by one as they listened to the piercing sound.
<br><br>Although they had seen this kitchen knife, they didn't have much confidence in its power when applied to actual combat.
<br><br>"Qingshan, you really are at the end of your rope, actually fighting me with a kitchen knife, who are you looking down on?" The Xuanwu old ancestor said with a face full of disdain as he pushed the palm print from above.
<br><br>"Try it, and you will see." Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan said expressionlessly, while his voice fell, his pupils shrank fiercely, and his palm swung out with it.
<br><br>Subsequently, a chopper without any fancy chopping out towards Xuanwu.
<br><br>Everyone shook their heads.
<br><br>This is undoubtedly just an egg against a stone!
<br><br>But the next moment, that ordinary kitchen knife suddenly blossomed into a dazzling light, and then pulled out a thousand feet long blade light.
<br><br>Under the light of the knife, everyone was too bright to open their eyes.
<br><br>At the same time, an invincible aura permeated the entire stormy stage, and those with weaker cultivation even had an urge to prostrate themselves.
<br><br>Of course, the first to bear the brunt is the Xuanwu old man.
<br><br>As strong as he was, he felt unusually small under this light, and the cold smile on his face froze abruptly.
<br><br>One slash.
<br><br>It directly broke through Xuanwu's palm print, destroying everything, and cut off one of the Xuanwu ancestor's arms as well.
<br><br>The tremendous pain and power reverberated on the Xuanwu Old Ancestor's body, and the Xuanwu Old Ancestor, accompanied by miserable screams, was like a fly scurrying over the stormy stage.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, everyone present was unbelievable and took a breath of cold air backwards, and the Castle Peak Sect even erupted with an unprecedented cheer.
<br><br>At the same time, a pair of blazing eyes focused on the chopper in the hands of the Old Man of Qingshan.
<br><br>The power of this chopper exceeded everyone's expectation, it was actually so terrifying as this!
<br><br>Peng Ying in the crowd opened her red lips in surprise, although she had seen this kitchen knife in Yu Wu Jie's jade brief, but definitely not as shocking as seeing it with her own eyes.
<br><br>What's even more incredible is that she feels more and more familiar with this kitchen knife.
<br><br>Even she felt that she had seen it more than once, but the strong shock made her unable to recall for a moment exactly where she had seen it.
<br><br>Of course, also more feel that they feel this feeling is too much of a fantasy.
<br><br>This kind of top-level divine weapon, how could she, a person who had gone through the back door to enter the Castle Peak Gate, have seen it before?
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan was also shocked by his own slash, and let out a confident laugh in mid-air.
<br><br>"Qing Shan, you despicable villain, why do you have such a terrifying divine weapon?" And Old Man Xuanwu was furious and shouted, "If you have the guts, put down the chopper and fight me fairly, otherwise what kind of hero you are."
<br><br>"Put down the kitchen knife for a fair fight?"
<br><br>"You want to be beautiful, I bully you no, what?"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan grunted angrily, with a loud laugh holding the kitchen knife in mid-air arced, and attacked towards Old Ancestor Xuan Wu again.
<br><br>The Xuanwu Old Ancestor was full of fear and did not dare to confront the Qingshan Old Ancestor head-on, turning into an arc and running away.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, the two old ancestors swept from the stormy platform one after the other, and soon had reached Pingjiang City in mid-air.
<br><br>"Boom ......"
<br><br>"Snort ......"
<br><br>"Hoo ......"
<br><br>Chasing after the Xuanwu Old Ancestor, the Qingshan Old Ancestor slashed past with one chopper after another, and the powerful might made the whole sky resound through and through.
<br><br>And the Xuanwu old ancestor is dangerous, wretched to the extreme, in the face of this terrifying chopper, he only run.
<br><br>And then, the two old ancestors swept away to Pingjiang, not knowing where to fight.
<br><br>"Fuck you."
<br><br>Distracted by the noise, Yi Feng cursed, put down the paper and pencil and walked out the door, looking at the remaining qi fluctuations in the sky, and immediately understood that there were cultivators fighting again.
<br><br>"In the end, which son of a bitch, to fight do not know to roll away, ah, yuck."
<br><br>Yi Feng spat a mouthful of spittle, then sarcastically walked back to the martial arts school, and waited for the sound to die down before resuming his quiet mind to continue his writings.
<br><br>In the next half a month, Yi Feng can be regarded as the hands of the "Purple Haze Fairy and the Supreme Treasure" book completed, and then get up and go towards the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>The person who received Yi Feng was the president of Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, Mao Lin.
<br><br>As a chamber of commerce president, his status is much better than ordinary people, originally this kind of person would not personally come to receive people, but Mao Lin once with the chamber of commerce into the mountains, was bitten by a poisonous snake, looking for many doctors are not good, or Yi Feng's herbs cured him, so Yi Feng is also considered Mao Lin's benefactor.
<br><br>"Oh, Master Yi please have tea."
<br><br>Mao Lin sat at the top, as a chamber of commerce president, naturally dressed flamboyantly, full of red, without missing a trace after glancing at Yi Feng, and then asked, "I do not know what Master Yi came to my chamber of commerce this time, what is the matter ah?"
<br><br>"No, it's not because you want me to print those useless fairy tales again, right?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Yi Feng frowned slightly, while his face became a little embarrassed.
<br><br>"Master Yi, truth be told, ah, you come to my place to have a seat, I can be a gracious host, after all, how to say you are also considered my benefactor." Mao Lin picked up the tea cup, after a light sip then said: "But if you want to print that useless thing again, I can not help you, although it is not a big deal, but to our Chamber of Commerce is really nothing profitable ah!"
<br><br>"After all."
<br><br>"Our Chamber of Commerce up and down so many people, always have to eat, the interests of the top, you think right?"
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng pursed his lips, his heart could not help but sigh, since this is the case, he did not bother to stay much, just about to get up and leave, the door of the room pushed open, a delicate figure walked in.
<br><br>She was tall, with pretty features and eyebrows, dressed in red long satin, outlining a stunningly beautiful water snake waist.
<br><br>"Yuner, can't you see I'm receiving guests, how can you barge in so rudely?" Mao Lin said rather reproachfully, but his eyes were filled with doting love.
<br><br>"Father, I came to ask if you can find the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber or not?" The woman called Yun'er pouted, and from the name, it was clear that this should be the Chamber of Commerce Mingzhu, Mao Lin's daughter Mao Yun'er.
