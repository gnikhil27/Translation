The two wove their way through unhindered.
<br><br>"Brother, how do you know there are gold coins inside!" While following the skeleton, the dog asked in confusion.
<br><br>"You say there are things in this world that I don't know?" The skeleton puffed out his chest and said.
<br><br>"That's true, who is my brother, that is the existence of charming thousands of girls!" The dog nodded his head and patted the horse's ass at the right time.
<br><br>The skeleton was very flattered, nodded in satisfaction, but then admonished in a serious tone, "Qing ah, although the truth is true, but whether we are a man or a dog, we have to keep a low profile."
<br><br>"Brother lesson is, I endowed in mind."
<br><br>With all the small talk, they finally crossed the corridor and came to the innermost hall.
<br><br>"Haha, Qing ah, my two brothers are rich." Skeleton Head took a glance at the almost mountainous pile of gold coins behind the altar, and immediately made an excited sound.
<br><br>"Congratulations brother, congratulations brother!"
<br><br>The dog also passed his voice with the same excitement.
<br><br>Under this glowing gold coins, these two brothers directly ignored the other things. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Go, fetch the treasure with brother!"
<br><br>The skeleton strutted towards the altar.
<br><br>"Swoosh!"
<br><br>Just two steps out, those three Saint Treasures floating in mid-air suddenly emitted a tremor and then shrouded in a layer of black mist.
<br><br>Then, they moved.
<br><br>The first one that came to haunt was the Saint Grade Heavenly Spirit Rope, which instantly haunted the top of the skeleton's head.
<br><br>"A broken grass rope is also blocking me from getting the treasure?"
<br><br>The skeleton impatiently stretched out his hand and grabbed it directly, pulled it in half, and threw it to the ground.
<br><br>In the next instant, the Saintly Wind and Cloud Mortar and the Divine Divine Devil Scissors attacked at the same time.
<br><br>"Grass, there is really no end to it."
<br><br>A fist blasted out.
<br><br>"Clang" two sound, that wind and cloud pestle only half left to fall on the ground.
<br><br>"And this broken scissors ......"
<br><br>The skeleton grabbed in his hand, directly crushed into a piece of scrap iron, thrown in a corner.
<br><br>"Bah, garbage things also dare to block the way!" The dog looked at the rags on the ground, spat, and also swaggered to follow.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>However, when the three just walked to the middle of the altar, the whole altar issued a deafening rumble, and a pillar of light also emerged from the ground.
<br><br>Crisis, quietly coming.
<br><br>"Brother, there seems to be a formation here eh!" The dog's hair shrugged and involuntarily leaned toward the skull while saying, "It looks very powerful, it doesn't seem to be good to break it, does brother have any good way?"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>"It's true that it's not very good to crack, because I don't know much about formations either." The skull scratched its head and said.
<br><br>"Then you can't do anything about it?" Doggie asked.
<br><br>"That is not without a solution."
<br><br>As he said, the skeleton lifted his paw and stomped on it.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>With a roar, the entire altar was cracked by the stomping, the trembling sensation disappeared, and the light emitted quietly dimmed.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>"Bull, bully!"
<br><br>The dog was dumbfounded and only had a bull to offer.
<br><br>The two finally arrived behind the altar without any problems.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, the old man finally has money."
<br><br>"Little sisters of the Yee Hong Yuan, wait for the master, this time I want to cover the venue!"
<br><br>Skeleton excitedly laughing, hands a handful of gold coins scattered, that black robe under the head of the skeleton, but also a blink kaba kaba sound.
<br><br>"Qing, put all the money into sacks, don't keep any of them!"
<br><br>Grabbed a large handful of sacks from the black robe, the skeleton shouted sharply.
<br><br>"Okay brother!"
<br><br>The dog took the sack, legs frantically towards the sack picking up the gold coins.
<br><br>With a burst of laughter, all the gold coins were loaded into the sacks.
<br><br>"Oops, this stuff looks pretty tasty eh?" After loading the gold coins, the skeleton looked again at the pills on the side, grabbed a handful and fed it towards the dog's mouth.
<br><br>"It does taste good!"
<br><br>The dog said approvingly.
<br><br>"How about this, there are still two more sacks, do you want to fill two sacks back as dog food?" Skull asked.
<br><br>"Please brother!" The dog said gratefully.
<br><br>"Two brothers, saying this to me?"
<br><br>Another burst of busyness, brought more than ten sacks are all packed.
<br><br>"What about the rest of the stuff?" The dog asked again, "What these books, what what what gong methods ......"
<br><br>"Burn it, these things are too spicy chicken, if it flows out, cultivating such a trash gong method, will only harm people ah!"
<br><br>The skeleton made a decision after deep consideration, the white finger bones flicked, a small string of fire emerged and fell to the ground.
<br><br>"Aiya brother, there is still a stone door here, will there be treasures inside?" The dog exclaimed again.
<br><br>"Oh, inside this ah, in addition to a dead man there are one or two pieces of rags, gold coins a no, regardless of him, let's go."
<br><br>The skeleton said carelessly, then picked up seven or eight sacks, and headed out.
<br><br>The dog also dragged several, and hurriedly followed in a frenzy.
