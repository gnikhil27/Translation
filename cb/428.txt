"Scuff!"
<br><br>Just at that moment, a powerful aura emerged from inside the hall where the four people were gathered.
<br><br>Sensing this aura, the crowd fiercely turned their gazes to Jian Hengtian who was on the side.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian you ......"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi fiercely stood up and turned his gaze towards Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>"You actually, you actually want to break through again, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Li Canghai was also full of incredulity.
<br><br>"Didn't you just break through a few days ago, did you suppress it a few days ago?"
<br><br>Yun Tian Tian said in surprise, but in a flash he realized something was wrong and exclaimed, "The other day you broke through to the eighth life, now your aura is to break through to the ninth life!"
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>When Yun Tianlong said this, the atmosphere in the hall almost exploded, three pairs of eyes stared deadly at Jian Hengtian, looking at his scalp numb. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's face was ugly.
<br><br>Secretly said a bad, the realm is going to be suppressed again.
<br><br>"Uh ...... huh, yes, it's about to break through the nine lives." He said with an embarrassed expression, somewhat not daring to meet the gaze of the three.
<br><br>If they knew that he, Jian Hengtian, had eaten alone when he knew there was an opportunity, these three might rise up and swarm him.
<br><br>"You actually really broke through the Nine Lives again, what the hell is wrong with you?"
<br><br>"Yes, breaking through one after another in just a few days, what exactly are you hiding from us?"
<br><br>"You say you are some kind of genius that comes along once in ten thousand years, it's just as well, you are an old thing that is half in the ground, why do you have the right to break through one level in a few days, come on, what is going on?"
<br><br>The three people stared at Jian Hengtian broken frequently questioning voice, the sword drawn look, as if Jian Hengtian does not say to sword to sword.
<br><br>"Didn't I say, I got the inheritance of my door sword fast ancestor Lord Sword Emperor."
<br><br>Sword Hengtian rolled his eyes and hurriedly explained.
<br><br>"Hmph, your family's ancestor is only a ten life Martial Emperor, at best a human immortal, what inheritance of his is so powerful that it allowed you, a person who took hundreds of years to go from six to seven lives, to break through from seven to nine life Martial Emperors in just a few days?" Liu Gu Yi said in a tit-for-tat manner.
<br><br>"Not bad, don't fool us like fools."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong picked up the conversation at the side.
<br><br>"Alas, although he does have the cultivation level of a Human Immortal, but don't you guys look at how many years he has advanced into a Human Immortal?"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian rolled his eyes and bragged cheekily, "It's just that the path to Immortality was broken at the beginning, limiting him to such a supreme genius, otherwise he would have been a Heavenly Immortal or even a Golden Immortal upwards."
<br><br>At those words, the three looked at each other.
<br><br>"It is indeed possible, after all, back then the Sword Emperor was known as the first genius of my Northern Sea in 100,000 years." Yun Tianlong guessed.
<br><br>It was only when Yun Tianlong said this that they nodded their heads.
<br><br>It was also true.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian had always been right there with them, there was no such thing that they didn't know about.
<br><br>I'm afraid that this was the only way it made sense for him to make a breakthrough one after another like this.
<br><br>"Misunderstood you."
<br><br>"Congratulations, hurry up and break through."
<br><br>"Yes, hurry up and breakthrough, you are the strongest in the future, you have to help us with anything."
<br><br>The three people have changed their attitudes and sent out congratulatory voices towards Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>But the tone of voice, but with a strong acidity and jealousy.
<br><br>Why, in our clan, how come we don't have an old ancestor who is so powerful.
<br><br>Hate!
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>The sky a stream of light cut.
<br><br>Zhu makes light imposing landing from the sky and came outside the courtyard of Yi Feng two.
<br><br>Now his Qingniu clan, plus these two mortals is just enough to make up a hundred people, enough for him to deal with the clan's numerical assessment in a month.
<br><br>It is also thanks to his titular patriarch personally down the mountain, squatting in Baier City, only to coax in two seemingly non-local people of the Iron Bean ah!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before the sect test, be sure to pacify the two mortals, absolutely not to let them run away ah.
<br><br>This is not, the great patriarch Zhu personally came over today to condole.
<br><br>When Zhu made light landed, Xiaodai ran out and shouted with a smile, "Greetings, Master."
<br><br>"Xiaodai, why are you here?" Zhu makes the light stand with his hands, and asks in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Enlighten me, Master, I am learning to play chess with Senior Brother Yi Feng." Xiaodai said cheerfully, "Senior brother Yi Feng is very good at chess."
<br><br>"Quite good."
<br><br>Zhu made the light smile, this can help him better to leave these two mortals.
<br><br>Zhu makes the light a high man's style, standing with his hands in the small courtyard.
<br><br>"Sovereign."
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and arched his hands.
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>Zhu made Guang waved his hand and said with a majestic face, "How's it going living here?"
<br><br>"Pretty good."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"En, that's good, but there are only two mortals in the whole clan, you two have to make good relations." Zhu made light a majestic explanation.
<br><br>"Please rest assured, Sovereign, the two of us are on pretty good terms." Yi Feng looked at Wu Chang'an at the side and asked with a smile, "Right, Brother Wu Tao?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Changan, who was shrunken on the bed and sitting in the corner, winced and reacted by quickly planting his head.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, we're fine."
<br><br>But after saying these words, he was about to cry.
<br><br>These days staying with Yi Feng night and day, he was about to go crazy.
<br><br>Every moment is shrouded in the pressure of death, so that his mind and soul consumption is huge, so that at the moment his face is pale, his hair is disheveled, living like a heavenly prison suffered great torture just out.
