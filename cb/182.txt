"Master can not, must not ah!"
<br><br>Ye Bei face face anxiously shouted, the heart is more anxious into a mess.
<br><br>He knew that this matter just can not be said out.
<br><br>Because his master, not only hot-tempered, is also known for not being afraid of death, notoriously reckless!
<br><br>Of course, it is also because of his recklessness, so that the talent is not particularly good, he is instead a great achievement.
<br><br>If it was in the past, he must have followed the nature of shaking the sky Que, but this time is completely different.
<br><br>Even Ye Bei is not without speculation, the martial school of that youth and that black-robed man is beyond the existence of the Martial Emperor.
<br><br>This kind of great power, his master a small Martial Emperor, is not looking for death?
<br><br>"Master!"
<br><br>Ye Bei saw that Shaking Heavenly Que did not listen to advice, he also simply face anxiously and forced a touch of green blade to his neck.
<br><br>"Disciple you?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Seeing this, the long sword at the foot of Shaking Heavenly Que was only considered to be hanging in mid-air.
<br><br>"Master, please and listen to my disciple's advice, we really are not their opponents, and simply not a level!" Ye Bei said: "And this matter is not their fault, but I first trouble, you only need to give me the innate spiritual treasure, the other by my own apprentice to solve bad?"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Shake Heavenly Que waved his robe sleeve, heaved a sigh, then sealed Ye Bei's cultivation.
<br><br>"Master you?"
<br><br>Ye Bei's face changed.
<br><br>Shake the sky Que waved his hand to interrupt, then said in a deep voice: "Although seal your cultivation, but today I can listen to you a persuasion."
<br><br>"However, you also know my sword dao, wait for the day of my martial dao, you then follow me down the mountain!"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Shake the sky Que with a sword back.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Bei sighed and shook his head.
<br><br>His master has the name of crazy sword, for the heart of the sword dao, even if it is really death will go, today can ask for this kind of retreat, already is not easy.
<br><br>But now, his cultivation is sealed, this place is at the edge of the South Sand, from the Martial Hall is already 10,000 miles away, he simply can not cross.
<br><br>I just hope that Shaking Heavenly Que will not break through the martial dwelling so early!
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Sword light across the snow jade dragon cold!"
<br><br>"The qi is cool and the god is clear at night!"
<br><br>"The poem is not great, the words are really good words!"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng put up his pen and looked at his calligraphy, could not help but sigh with emotion.
<br><br>"Counting the time, now I'm afraid it's close to the Spring Festival in the previous life!" Yi Feng looked at the cold air outside the window, could not help but lament out.
<br><br>"Then write another pair of Spring Festival couplets!"
<br><br>Yi Feng found two more red rice paper, put his pen on the rice paper and wrote down two spring couplets, nodded in satisfaction and shouted: "Disciple ah, since it's good don't nest, hurry, put this pair of spring couplets on the door."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Little Zhong Qing put on a big cotton jacket, took a breath of turbulent air, lifted Yi Feng's two spring couplets and walked outside.
<br><br>After putting up the couplets, he returned to Yi Feng's side.
<br><br>"Disciple ah, now that you have recovered from your injury, practice martial arts well!" Looking at Zhong Qing, Yi Feng smiled, "And this sword has been given to you for so long, it seems that you haven't been taught the sword technique, right?"
<br><br>"Yes Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing tightened the long knife in his hand and nodded his head obediently.
<br><br>"For my master to practice saber to compare with God, I have summed up a total of three styles, and today I will teach these three styles to you." Yi Feng put down the brush in his hand and said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Dare I ask Master, which three styles?" Zhong Qing asked in confusion.
<br><br>"Cleave, Slash and Chop!"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed leisurely, "You have to remember that all changes cannot be separated from these three styles, as long as you practice these three styles, this sword will naturally be freely wielded in your hands."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng took the long knife and gave Zhong Qing three styles to play.
<br><br>After brushing, he returned the sword to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"From now on, you will practice these three styles!"
<br><br>"Oh, okay!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his head, although he didn't know why Yi Feng would want him to practice these three mediocre stances, he still listened to Yi Feng's words unconditionally.
<br><br>Autumn was gradually passing.
<br><br>Winter has arrived.
<br><br>Outside the house, already is floating goose feather snow.
<br><br>The day, as always, went on.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong three people are still opening up the land, so long only half of the time, forced by the weather, Yi Feng can also understand the efficiency.
<br><br>The land is not done, the natural dung can not be less.
<br><br>With Wu Yonghong three people's efficiency is reduced, Lu Dasheng every day is also a lot easier, generally in the morning to pick up the dung.
<br><br>Just let people can not figure out is, in the afternoon he can obviously go to rest, but always stay by the dung pit is until dark, while the mouth chanting words, shouting can not shout.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was wielding a large knife.
<br><br>Day after day to practice the three styles of slashing, cutting, chopping.
<br><br>However, the broken skull head still does not seem to let people worry, not to mention the whole day does not return home, Yi Feng hidden under the bed of gold coins, seems to be reduced from time to time.
<br><br>Of course, the whole day obsessed with calligraphy Yi Feng, also have no time to care about these.
<br><br>After another pair of couplets fell into his pen, a familiar voice finally appeared in his mind.
<br><br>"Ding: Congratulations to the host, the calligraphy has reached a level comparable to that of a god!"
<br><br>"Finally, it's finished."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded in satisfaction, looking at the two newly produced Spring Couplets at hand, Yi Feng shouted again, "O disciple, tear up those two couplets at the door and replace them with this one."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing put away his long knife, took down the new two couplets and put them up again at the door.
<br><br>"Master's writing, it's so beautiful."
<br><br>Zhong Qing clapped his small hands, stepped on the snow on the ground, and prepared to go back to the house.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Just then, a figure smashed from some direction and landed directly at Zhong Qing's feet.
<br><br>At the same time, in the mouth, a large mouthful of blood was spurting, and the whole person became moribund.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was stunned.
<br><br>Before he could open his mouth to ask questions, not far from the doorway, another man with a huge sword came, slowly forcing his way towards the injured man.
<br><br>"Black Sword, 10,000 miles away, you still want to chase me, what is the pain?"
<br><br>The injured man shouted with a resigned face.
<br><br>"I want to prove that I am the number one sword in the Southern Sands!" Black Sword said icily.
<br><br>"You've already proved it, why do you still want to chase me to death?" The wounded man shouted.
<br><br>"Because under my sword, I never leave anyone alive, so you must die!" With a cold voice, Black Sword stepped on the snow and finally approached, pulling out the huge sword in his hand, and wanted to cut down.
<br><br>"Stop."
<br><br>Suddenly, Zhong Qing stood in front of the injured man with red cheeks and shouted, "No fighting in front of our martial school."
<br><br>After glancing at Zhong Qing, Black Sword directly ignored it and raised the giant sword in his hand with a bang.
<br><br>"Move."
<br><br>The injured man hurriedly shouted to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>But however, the giant sword in that black sword's hand was already on top of Zhong Qing's head.
<br><br>This sword.
<br><br>Carrying an endless pressure, it came straight down.
<br><br>Seeing this, the injured man revealed a deathly pallor, because this sword came down, where the sword light passed, there would be no grass.
<br><br>Unfortunately.
<br><br>Before he died, he had to drag a small child with him.
<br><br>He closed his eyes.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>But at that moment, a pleasant sound rang in his ears, and he snapped his eyes wide open, shocked to find the little boy next to him, lifting his sword and picking off the sword.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>With a buzzing sound, the giant sword plunged straight into the ground, penetrating half a foot into the ground.
<br><br>"I told you not to fight in front of my martial arts school, why didn't you listen?"
<br><br>The little boy's face turned red and his face was full of unhappiness as he emitted his voice.
