The woman's pretty face revealed a strong look of surprise.
<br><br>These three days down, she carefully step by step, but still encountered many demonic beasts, more several times a close call, and finally with her strength and part of the luck, which survived.
<br><br>However, this mortal carrying a king's hawk is safe and sound, even the plain green robe, are still kept spotless.
<br><br>Is it that the demonic beasts in this mountain can't lift their swords, or are they blind?
<br><br>Or is this mortal too lucky?
<br><br>But she, the luck is so bad?
<br><br>How can she think, but also can not figure out how in the end Yi Feng did safe and sound, because in her opinion, not to mention a mortal, even a martial arts expert in the mountain range today, is also ten deaths without life situation.
<br><br>With great doubts in her heart, she swept her body and went after Yi Feng.
<br><br>"It's you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng saw the visitor, surprised to reveal a smile.
<br><br>But the woman did not speak, the pair of soulful eyes looked up and down at Yi Feng. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The look was even more surprised.
<br><br>Yi Feng actually, not even a trace of wretched appearance?
<br><br>Only after a long time did she take a deep breath and said with a complicated expression, "To think that you, a mortal, are still alive."
<br><br>"What kind of words are you talking about?"
<br><br>At that, Yi Feng's face sank, this is not cursing him to die?
<br><br>"Sorry, I didn't mean anything else, I was just surprised." The woman hurriedly explained, but the incredulity on her face did not dissipate for a long time.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded indifferently.
<br><br>After the two of them exchanged a few more pleasantries, the woman prepared to leave, and before she left, she said in a complicated manner, "I hope that next, you will still be so lucky!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but smile helplessly.
<br><br>This woman is really a bit nervous, this mountain which is not as dangerous as she said? So many days down, he did not see bumped.
<br><br>But this woman is still a good person, when he asked for directions and sent him down the mountain, so he took out a small package and said, "I have a bug repellent bag, I made it myself with herbs, why don't you take it with you?"
<br><br>The woman took a look at the insect repellent bag and frowned: "I think this thing, you need it more than I do?"
<br><br>"It should be you who needs it more." Yi Feng laughed leisurely: "After all, this thing is dispensable to me."
<br><br>This is not wrong for Yi Feng to say.
<br><br>In his mind, although this girl is a cultivator, she should still hate snakes and insects and ants, while in comparison, he as a man is much more immune to such things.
<br><br>"I need it more?"
<br><br>The woman felt a little amused.
<br><br>To be honest, such mortal and such items had long since lost their usefulness to martial cultivators like her.
<br><br>However, looking at Yi Feng's smiling face, she still accepted the insect repellent bag and hung it on her waist with her hand.
<br><br>Although he was lucky, but this kind of luck may not always be able to maintain ah!
<br><br>The probability is that the person will die.
<br><br>Consider it, as a final consolation for him!
<br><br>After saying that, the woman looked at Yi Feng, swept up and disappeared in the jungle.
<br><br>Another day dusk.
<br><br>A shady canyon, the Eagle King attached to the rock.
<br><br>And on the side, also flickered a pair of gloomy eyes, spitting snake letters at the same time, it opened its mouth and asked: "Eagle King, how is it?"
<br><br>"There is still no sign of the Demon Emperor."
<br><br>The Eagle King said with a frown: "And under the extermination order, except for a human martial king lingering, all other humans have been cleared out, but just now, according to the little demon to report, another human youth was found, in order to prevent accidents, trouble the Snake King you run with me!"
<br><br>"To serve the demon emperor, it should be."
<br><br>The voice fell, the two demons turned into two streams of light, leading a large number of demonic beasts towards the mountain range where they were.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>The woman who had just left with Yi Feng not long ago, felt these powerful fluctuations rushing towards Yi Feng's direction, and her beautiful eyes, which were hiding in the shadows, suddenly frowned.
<br><br>"Was he found out?"
<br><br>The woman clenched her shell teeth, hesitating whether to turn back to rescue Yi Feng.
<br><br>But feeling the two Demon Kings' breath, she still gave up this intention, because now she was heavily injured, she had long been no match for the two Demon Kings.
<br><br>If she went back, it would only be a death sentence.
<br><br>"I hope that in the next life, you won't be reckless enough to enter such a dangerous place again!"
<br><br>She heaved a sigh, her heart was sorry but there was nothing she could do, her body swept slightly and disappeared in the jungle.
