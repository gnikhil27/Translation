Yi Feng is gone.
<br><br>Left the Xuantian Sect far, far away ......
<br><br>In fact, he didn't know why he suddenly had such an awakening.
<br><br>Was it the deceitfulness within the Xuantian Sect that made him tired of it, or was it witnessing the deaths of all the Star Peak disciples that made him retreat?
<br><br>He did not know.
<br><br>But what he clearly felt was this: deep inside, a voice was calling out to him, and his subconscious seemed to be reminding him.
<br><br>There were also system upgrades of the various selves he saw hovering constantly in his mind.
<br><br>This feeling is amazing.
<br><br>Impossible to catch and feel.
<br><br>It's as if he sat down at the Grand Prix when he was haunted.
<br><br>But what the heck. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Happy is good.
<br><br>This immortal cultivation days, indeed, not as comfortable as his previous kind of salted fish days.
<br><br>Besides, nowadays there is strength, occasionally want to pretend, can also come a wave.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"A major catastrophe, finally passed?"
<br><br>"This scum can finally not have to give up my gold, back to the furnace to recreate ah!"
<br><br>Outside a tavern, the skeleton Ben Wei who was covered in gold coins looked at the sky and forked his small waist.
<br><br>"To celebrate, let's set a small goal first."
<br><br>"Spend a fucking billion today first!"
<br><br>On the sea island.
<br><br>A toad and a snail were lying on the ground, not moving for many days.
<br><br>At this moment, suddenly glared at each other.
<br><br>"Quack quack quack glare nima it?"
<br><br>"Bulu Bulu, and nima?"
<br><br>The two were lying on the ground sputtering, and finally won with a back hooked leg of the toad kicking the snail over to the ground.
<br><br>Far away at the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>Ye Bei carefully converted the emperor's treasures into a mop and carefully cleaned the martial arts hall.
<br><br>Since Mr. left, this became something he had to do every day.
<br><br>After mopping every corner, he stretched his back and got up, looking at the sky and fell into deep thought.
<br><br>When he first came to the school, he had the guts to kick the door, and the episode when he was buckled to the ground with a basket of vegetables by Mr., was still vivid in his mind.
<br><br>Although not long ago, but his life has long since been turned upside down because of this vegetable basket.
<br><br>"And I don't know when Mr. will be back."
<br><br>He was filled with longing.
<br><br>Suddenly, he noticed that the old acacia tree behind him seemed to have moved.
<br><br>"An illusion?"
<br><br>Ye Bei took a look and approached the old acacia tree and touched its trunk.
<br><br>"Some time ago this acacia tree had fallen leaves constantly, today it seems to suddenly have a new spring."
<br><br>"How nice, then ask the manure picker to carry two buckets to water it again!"
<br><br>"When the gentleman comes back, the shade will be bigger, so it will be better for the cool."
<br><br>The words fell.
<br><br>The leaves fell to the ground.
<br><br>Inside a tavern in the immortal world.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat at the window, sipping a small drink.
<br><br>"Sir, I wonder when I will return to Dark Shadow Island!"
<br><br>Next to him, was Gong Chen who stood respectfully.
<br><br>"In a few days!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said carelessly, while his mind was all on the lamb he had just accidentally dropped on the table.
<br><br>Taking advantage of people's inattention.
<br><br>As fast as lightning, he picked up the piece of meat and brought it to his mouth.
<br><br>Delicious!
<br><br>I think, no one will see it, right?
<br><br>He inclined his head to look, just in time to find Gong Chen staring at himself.
<br><br>"Sir, I don't know what realm it is to."
<br><br>"Really off the dust into the mundane ah!"
<br><br>Gong Chen heart emotion, full of worship.
<br><br>It's over, it's over, it's going to be socially dead.
<br><br>Yi Feng is full of embarrassment, his heart is in a mess, such an embarrassing thing, how to be seen by this guy?
<br><br>Two people.
<br><br>Just look at each other.
<br><br>Long long long long.
<br><br>Yi Feng passed a look towards Gong Chen.
<br><br>Gong Chen saw this, also passed a look towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"En, this guy should understand my look and won't say anything." Yi Feng thought this way.
<br><br>"En, sir should have understood my eyes, I am absolutely sincere and absolutely loyal to him." Gong Chen thought this way.
<br><br>Thinking of this, both sides looked at each other again.
<br><br>A heartfelt smile.
<br><br>"By the way, what strength are you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked, changing the topic.
<br><br>"Back sir, I'm at the True Element Immortal Realm." Gong Chen said respectfully.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"When did you reach the True Element Immortal Realm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was surprised.
<br><br>"Sir doesn't know?"
<br><br>Gong Chen was also amazed, his own strength, sir would actually not see it?
<br><br>"Indeed, I don't know." Yi Feng explained rather awkwardly, "Because I look at you and look at him, not much difference."
<br><br>At these words, Gong Chen shifted his gaze, following Yi Feng's vision, and fixed on the Human Immortal boy who was doing the chores in the restaurant.
<br><br>"In the eyes of the gentleman, we, poor ...... poor request not much?"
<br><br>Gong Chen face is quite ugly.
<br><br>"Yes, although know that you are very difficult, but indeed." Yi Feng chucked a peanut rice in his mouth.
<br><br>It wasn't that he was purposely pretending.
<br><br>After the system gave him a fifty-level promotion, he looked at all these people did look the same, and there was just a drop of points in his body.
<br><br>I do not know whether this is the effect of the system or what, in short, this is the case.
<br><br>Yi Feng also can not understand.
<br><br>But what the heck, where to see this, can not beat themselves is.
<br><br>Of course there is time later, or to understand the back of the realm to understand, to calculate, they are now a realm in the end.
<br><br>"Sir no need to explain, I know."
<br><br>Although Gong Chen did have that little bit of difficulty, but also understand.
<br><br>After all, the True Element Immortal realm and the Human Immortal in the eyes of the gentleman, I'm afraid there is not much difference, it's all a matter of a breath of air.
