Following Zhong Qing, Guan Yunpeng trembled as he walked toward the martial arts school.
<br><br>One way to go.
<br><br>One way to the heart frightened.
<br><br>Until the end, straight feel the whole person to become numb.
<br><br>From the door of that step, everywhere you look, there are treasures.
<br><br>The mirror hanging in the hall of fame, the pictures on both sides of the wall, the large black umbrella that was casually resting, the flame beads that were placed in the stove, and even the rags that were hung on the bamboo pole ......
<br><br>He has lost count.
<br><br>Only know that every time you see a treasure, the body can not help but sink a point, through this hall, he almost prostrated on the ground.
<br><br>"Master, I bring a person." Zhong Qing said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Zhong Qing's words instantly made Guan Yunpeng a jolt, which was busy looking up towards the front.
<br><br>A youth. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Fell into his eyes.
<br><br>The white robe is spotless, with a gentle and elegant temperament, the right hand holding a pen standing on the side of the desk, all through a sense of dust, is looking at him with a faint smile smile.
<br><br>This one.
<br><br>It is the senior Zhong Qing's master?
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Different from the ordinary!
<br><br>But he and Zhong Qing senior general, so I can not see the bottom of the details, and do not know what the cultivation level.
<br><br>And also at the same time, Zhong Qing told Yi Feng what had just happened in the martial arts school, and Yi Feng gave him an appreciative look, then smiled at Guan Yunpeng and said, "Sit down."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng nodded his head with restraint, even though there were stools on the side, but he still didn't dare to sit down.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>His pupils shrank.
<br><br>His eyes stared deadly at the Xuan paper filled with brushstrokes.
<br><br>A fierce thud in the heart.
<br><br>He was horrified to find that the fonts on the rice paper, all with something that horrified him.
<br><br>Such as that square font that carried the aura of greatness.
<br><br>The font that was like a blade, carrying a strong sword qi.
<br><br>There are also many, many different fonts, or sword intent, or dao rhyme, or martial intent, or calming to the mind, or making one's blood boil ......
<br><br>What makes him even more incredible is that the rice paper filled with fonts, on the ground, on the desk, even under the feet of Yi Feng stepped, spread everywhere, as if discarded garbage.
<br><br>"Mr. write the word, good, really good!"
<br><br>He swallowed a mouthful of saliva, he usually still has some level, actually can not think of a word that can reflect the praise.
<br><br>"You know how to write too?"
<br><br>At that, Yi Feng asked in surprise towards Guan Yunpeng.
<br><br>"Slightly understand, slightly understand."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng hurriedly bowed and said, "It's just that at this level, I don't dare to show off my skills in front of you."
<br><br>"Haha, you're welcome, by the way what's your name?" Yi Feng was quite excited, he didn't expect to meet a fellow practitioner.
<br><br>"Guan Yunpeng."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng hurriedly answered.
<br><br>"Guan Yunpeng, good name."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and wrote down the three words Guan Yunpeng on a new piece of rice paper, then handed it to Guan Yunpeng and smiled, "How about you look at the three words."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng took the rice paper with both hands respectfully, and then felt a strong sword intent come over him.
<br><br>"Good, good, good."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng held the rice paper with both hands, his mouth shouted out, his eyes shining brightly, he never thought that his name written out could play such a role.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled slightly, it was always exciting to be praised, so he said, "Then if you like it, it's for you."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Send, give it to me?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's heart was beating violently, trembling his body, looking at Yi Feng with an incredulous face, full of surprise.
<br><br>"Just a few words, it's no big deal!" Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"Many thanks, many thanks senior."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng held the rice paper with both hands, hot tears of excitement spread, and his trembling body was about to kneel down towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hurriedly helped him up, looking at his eyes that were vaguely tinged with tears, he couldn't help but feel, how much does this person like words?
<br><br>Thinking of his body is still wounded, so he smiled again: "I'll show you the wound!"
<br><br>"This, how dare I trouble you, sir?" Guan Yunpeng said flattered.
<br><br>"Meeting each other is fate, what's so troublesome about it." Yi Feng said with a gentle smile.
<br><br>"Well then, I'll trouble you sir."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng could hardly hold down the excitement in his heart, he did not expect that not only would he survive today's disaster, but he could also obtain such a chance continuously.
<br><br>Approaching Yi Feng, he said again with restraint, "It's just that sir, I'm afraid this injury of mine is not easy to treat!"
<br><br>"You think too much." Yi Feng gave him a white glance and said, "What's so bad about a superficial injury?"
<br><br>"Skin, external injury?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng smacked his lips and looked at Yi Feng incredulously.
<br><br>It seemed that there was only one sword mark on his body, but his internal meridians and internal organs had long been injured by the sword qi of the black sword, but this person said it was a superficial injury?
<br><br>Is he not able to see the condition of his body, or in his opinion is really so light?
<br><br>Between his surprise, Yi Feng had already asked Zhong Qing to bring crushed herbs.
<br><br>"Put it on, it will soon be healed."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng took the medicinal herb and applied it to Guan Yunpeng's wound with a "pop".
<br><br>So sloppy?
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng opened his mouth, although he admitted that this big brother cultivation is heavenly, but does he have any misunderstanding about healing wounds?
<br><br>But just as this doubt rose, he was shocked to find that a warm current had entered his body along his wound, not only dispelling the sword qi left in his body, but also repairing his traumatized meridians and internal organs at a visible speed.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Once this comfortable feeling came, Guan Yunpeng couldn't help but shiver.
<br><br>What kind of heaven-defying means is this that is so terrifying as this!
<br><br>For a moment, he looked at Yi Feng with an even more fervent gaze and hurriedly bowed towards him, saying gratefully, "Senior's means are truly formidable, not only does he have a heavenly cultivation, while carrying a junior like me, he also has a good heart to universalize all beings."
<br><br>"Cultivation through the heavens?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Guan Yunpeng, shook his head and laughed, "Are you mistaken, I don't have a heavenly cultivation, I'm just a mortal."
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Just now, the disciple who killed the black sword said he was a mortal, but now this big brother with heaven-defying methods actually said he was a mortal too?
<br><br>"Senior, you are too modest, why do you keep a low profile and conceal yourselves when you obviously possess heavenly means?" Finally, he wondered and asked the doubt in his heart.
<br><br>"I don't have any heavenly means, I'm really just a mortal."
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but give him a white look, thinking that he wouldn't run into another middle-aged bastard like Wu Yonghong, right?
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was even more confused.
<br><br>Really can't figure out, so powerful why to pretend to be a mortal.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"Sir, today's work is almost done, we came to have a chat with you."
<br><br>Just then, a few shouts came from outside the door.
<br><br>Then, under the dumbfounded gaze of Guan Yunpeng, several old men covered with mud walked in.
