After sending these immortal cultivators away, Yi Feng slept until dawn.
<br><br>Thinking about the condition of his disciple, Yi Feng did not dare to delay and continued to search for traces of cloud road flowers in the mountains.
<br><br>Snake and eagle double boil for food, rain and dew mountain springs to quench thirst.
<br><br>Unknowingly, it was another day in the evening.
<br><br>"Huh!"
<br><br>"Cloudy Road Flower."
<br><br>Finally, Yi Feng found the trail of Cloud Road Flower in a mountain stream.
<br><br>After picking the cloud road flower, Yi Feng showed a joyful smile, this trip down can be described as full of harvest ah, Zhong Qing need all the medicinal herbs picked not only, but also got a lot of wildlife.
<br><br>Of course the unexpected harvest is the ring in your hand.
<br><br>In his previous life, he had seen a lot of immortal novels, and this time he finally got what he wanted to use.
<br><br>I have to say. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This thing is really fucking convenient.
<br><br>But the sky is dark, even if the heart is concerned about the disciple, but the midnight dark rush is not quite right, the beast is just, he does not want to die in which the cliff under.
<br><br>"Looks like we have to find a place to stay at night!"
<br><br>Yi Feng slightly sighed, after all, last night's place of residence simply can not find the ground.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Among the mountains and clear water.
<br><br>The waterfall cascaded down.
<br><br>White floating hand holding the red house dream, frowning at the next Mao Mao, asked: "Mao Mao, so many days, or no news?"
<br><br>Mao Mao said in a low voice: "Miss, I have sent many people down the mountain to inquire, simply can not find the author, as if the news is deliberately blocked."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao wrinkled her good-looking eyebrows and said softly: "Then check again, in recent days I have read the Dream of the Red Chamber and the Supreme Treasure again, and have a new understanding of the books, the gentleman who wrote these two books I can't wait to meet him."
<br><br>"Ah, Miss, I thought you have not even like this author." Mao Mao rose his small mouth and said, "Otherwise you wouldn't have been staring at that mortal's verses all day long."
<br><br>White floating white Mao Mao glance, softly said: "you do not understand, the writings of the red building dream of the gentleman is everyone, Yi Feng's verses also have a special flavor, people are also very interesting people, they two are not contradictory."
<br><br>"Of course, I worship the gentleman who writes Dream of the Red Chamber, and I can only feel like a confidant to Yi Feng ......."
<br><br>"Oh, well!"
<br><br>Mao Mao scratched his little brain, then said, "But that Yi Feng recently how also not seen to come, the last time he baked something is really delicious."
<br><br>"Even if he wants to come, I'm afraid he can't find it here." Bai Piaoqiao shook his head and said.
<br><br>"Right Oh, Miss you do not say I forgot, in order to avoid this mountain demon beast riot, we have opened the formation." Mao Mao said embarrassingly, "Now with the formation on, not to mention Yi Feng, a mortal, even a Martial Emperor powerhouse wouldn't be able to find this place."
<br><br>"Forget it, let's not talk about that."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao put down the two books of Dream of the Red Chamber, stroked her jade hand to the long zither, and said in anguish: "You know that I cultivate the zither dao, now I am stuck in the bottleneck period, and urgently need to compose a zither score, so as to help me break through."
<br><br>"Last time, Yi Feng's poem gave me a lot of inspiration, and I wanted to use his poem as the words to compose a zither score, but I always felt that something was missing."
<br><br>"Miss, it's all my fault, I don't know anything about the zither, I can't help you." Mao Mao pouted her little mouth and said sadly.
<br><br>"Well silly girl, you just don't be sad for me, the time has come, I can always cross over, you'd better pass the message out well, continue to inquire about that gentleman of the Red Chamber Dream for me!" White Peopeo got up and rubbed Mao Mao's head, and explained softly.
<br><br>"Okay Miss, then you must not be too anxious, I'll leave first."
<br><br>After saying that, Mao Mao was ready to turn around and leave.
<br><br>But however, just as she turned around, the courtyard door, suddenly came the sound of knocking on the door.
<br><br>"Knock knock!"
<br><br>This sound was so pleasant to the ear.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao and Mao Mao's face suddenly changed, like a big enemy!
<br><br>Without saying a word, Mao Mao's hand long sword pulled out.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's long skirt is in the air a swing, again in the zither next to the seat and down, Qian Qian jade hand tight hook zither strings, eyes vigilantly looking at the door.
<br><br>To know, because of the mountain demon beast riot, they directly opened the formation, under the envelope of the formation, the Martial Emperor strong people can not find this place, yet outside the door came the knocking sound.
<br><br>It is simply a fine thought.
<br><br>It meant that this person was either a super expert passing by or an enemy who had come prepared.
<br><br>"Knock, knock!"
<br><br>The knocking sound, once again, sounded.
<br><br>It simply touched the nerves of the two women.
<br><br>"Miss, what should we do?" Mao Mao's face flickered with gloom as she asked in a low voice.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes turned, thinking for a moment, said softly: "Since the visitor can find here, no matter what the purpose, a door can not stop him, since you can not hide, so go to open the door!
<br><br>But despite these words, Bai Piao Piao hooked the jade hand of the qin, but more tightly.
<br><br>Mao Mao nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Tightly bite the small mouth, carefully towards the door, palm to the door bolt, pull open violently.
