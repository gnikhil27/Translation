 Hearing this, Luo Lanxue was ecstatic to the core.
<br><br>At the same time, she was also very much looking forward to what kind of book Yi Feng was writing, but she felt sure it was a best seller!
<br><br>On the side, Yin Luo Li also smiled with her eyebrows.
<br><br>She was not old, but she was more resourceful than anyone else. If this great master's book was sold in her family's chamber, it would be a great opportunity for their chamber.
<br><br>After sitting for a few moments, the three of them came directly to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>The person who received the three was the president Yin Xiong, who was tall and full of red, especially happy to see his baby daughter back.
<br><br>Of course, he was also very polite to Luo Lanxue.
<br><br>After all, no matter what, Luo Lanxue was Yin Luolie's senior sister, the most beloved disciple of Old Ancestor Qingshan.
<br><br>"I wonder if this is?" Yin Xiong looked at Yi Feng and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"This is Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue hurriedly introduced, while not waiting for Yin Xiong to speak, he directly invited Yi Feng into the upper seat. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Greetings, Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Yin Xiong bowed slightly towards Yi Feng while flashing his gaze and pulled Luo Lanxue to the side.
<br><br>"Niece, this Mr. Yi, who exactly is he?" He asked softly towards Luo Lanxue, as the president of the Chamber of Commerce, he had long lived as a human being for so many years.
<br><br>Just now Luo Lanxue's deference to Yi Feng he could see it clearly.
<br><br>What's more peculiar is that his daughter Yin Luo Li, who has always been lively and naughty, is also exceptionally well-behaved in front of him. This makes him have to be interested in the identity of this "Mr. Yi".
<br><br>Luo Lanxue glanced at Yi Feng, who was tasting tea, seemed to be asking.
<br><br>Long time, see Yi Feng and no difference, she then lowered her head softly towards Yin Xiong extra solemnly said: "Uncle, Mr. Yi's identity I am not at liberty to disclose too much, but you have to remember, even my master, in front of him also have to respectfully call Mr., and today, may also be your Baofeng Chamber of Commerce's great opportunity, so be sure to grasp. "
<br><br>At these words, Yin Xiong's body trembled.
<br><br>At once, he sucked in a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>He never doubted that Luo Lanxue said big words, the solemnity of the latter's tone he could feel, he did not expect that Luo Lanxue actually brought him such a big Buddha, a figure that the Old Ancestor of Green Mountain respects, that ......
<br><br>He as a mortal from the business, do not dare to continue to think.
<br><br>But at least, the next attitude what to do, he already has a number.
<br><br>"Someone, serve the Chamber's best dim sum." With a wave of Yin Xiong's robe sleeve, a line of delicate and beautiful maids lined up to bring up plates of dim sum, afraid of neglecting Yi Feng.
<br><br>After some conversation, Yi Feng directly stated his intention.
<br><br>"To publish a book?"
<br><br>Yin Xiong smiled, and almost without the slightest hesitation, he shouted the butler up.
<br><br>"Master, please give the order."
<br><br>The butler said respectfully.
<br><br>"From today onwards, the Chamber of Commerce will do its best to help Mr. Yi publish his book, whether it's the layout, handwriting, printing, make sure to do the best, if there's any mistake, I'll take you for it." Yin Xiong directly commanded.
<br><br>"Master, but the Chamber of Commerce is currently focused on jewelry, gold and silver, and cultivator supplies, once the slack, will be Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce to encroach on the market, do you think?" The butler looked up and said worriedly.
<br><br>"I do not know these, let you say so much?"
<br><br>Yin Xiong suddenly became angry and directly slapped the butler's face, drinking, "I told you to focus the Chamber on Mr. Yi's book, just do it, you don't need to say much about other things."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The housekeeper's color changed in fear, not daring to speak, holding his swollen face and hastily retreating.
<br><br>"President Yin, this is not necessary, it is still your chamber's original business that is important!" Yi Feng said flattered, he just want to issue books to earn some family money, but never thought of pouring the Chamber's strength to help him issue books.
<br><br>"What's wrong with that? To be honest, I like to read books myself, and our Chamber of Commerce also has plans to develop in this direction." Yin Xiong said with a smile on his face, and his words could be considered as dripping with water.
<br><br>The first time, look at the side of the Yin Luo Li and Luo Lan Xue a bewildered.
<br><br>Yin Luo Li couldn't help but slander: How come I didn't know that our family's Chamber of Commerce was going to develop in this direction?
