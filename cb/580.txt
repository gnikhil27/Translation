Yi Feng followed the crowd to Star Peak and stayed there.
<br><br>Up to this moment.
<br><br>He was still a bit like a dream.
<br><br>He just joined the Sun Moon Sect?
<br><br>What a magic fantasy.
<br><br>But it's also good, came to the immortal world Yi Feng did not know where to go, originally also wanted to find a sect to join.
<br><br>Now it is convenient for him.
<br><br>As far as Yi Feng knows, all new disciples can go to the Immortal Technique Pavilion to pick a set of immortal skills.
<br><br>Immortal skills are divided into low level immortal skills, medium level immortal skills, high level immortal skills, and top level immortal skills.
<br><br>For the human, earth, and sky three immortal realms, to be able to acquire a low-level immortal skills, can already be used as a base card.
<br><br>The Sun Moon Sect can let new disciples pick immortal skills to practice, but also can see its heritage. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And Yi Feng naturally does not want to waste this opportunity.
<br><br>He went straight to the Immortal Technique Pavilion and picked out a low-level immortal technique.
<br><br>After returning to the dormitory, he couldn't wait to cultivate it.
<br><br>Because he wanted to confirm to confirm that he is now a cultivation genius or not, last time in one night will be a good cultivation of the Heavenly Demon Body, he did not forget the matter.
<br><br>Open the jade slip.
<br><br>A complex message was imprinted into Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>One thought finger.
<br><br>It said something about being able to pierce the void with one finger.
<br><br>And the cultivation method is what qi sinks into the dantian.
<br><br>Mobilization of immortal yuan, how how how ......
<br><br>See the Yi Feng head big, drowsy.
<br><br>Just like the former world school reading a book, looking at it and fell asleep.
<br><br>When he woke up, it was already to the next morning.
<br><br>When he woke up the next morning, he was surprised to find that the finger he cultivated last night, actually was a change.
<br><br>"This change ......"
<br><br>"It seems to be a sign of having successfully cultivated the One Thought Finger?"
<br><br>Yi Feng recalled the content within the jade slip.
<br><br>It seemed that this was the state when the One Thought Finger had become a success.
<br><br>Saying that, he tried to raise his finger and pointed towards the sky.
<br><br>Then he saw that a subtle qi energy was forced out towards the sky.
<br><br>Although the sound of breaking wind did not set off, the power appears to be very small, but this is indeed the appearance of successful cultivation.
<br><br>As for why the power is so small, Yi Feng also probably knows the reason.
<br><br>It may be that his realm is too low, only human immortal.
<br><br>After all, it is said that the Immortal Realm space is incomparably stable, and the density is countless times that of the Immortal River Continent, so an ordinary Human Immortal can't even break a stone in the Immortal Realm, so it is already very good that he can hit a qi energy.
<br><br>Yi Feng's body trembled with excitement, and his mouth almost smiled crookedly.
<br><br>However, he forced himself to calm down.
<br><br>He needed to ask how long it would take for others to cultivate the One Thought Finger.
<br><br>In case it didn't take a few days for others to cultivate the One Thought Finger, then he would be happy for nothing.
<br><br>He walked out of the dormitory and searched for a target in the huge Star Peak, and also inquired that a senior brother named You Duxing also cultivated the One Thought Finger in Star Peak.
<br><br>And he has been in the Star Peak for many years, and has long been a Xuan Xian cultivation.
<br><br>So Yi Feng felt that it was always right to ask this You Duxing.
<br><br>A broken cliff.
<br><br>You Duxing was sitting here, with a long sword on his shoulder and his eyes closed.
<br><br>"Is senior brother You in?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted lightly.
<br><br>You Duxing opened his eyes and turned his gaze to the smiling Yi Feng.
<br><br>"You are the new Human Immortal disciple who came in these two days, right?"
<br><br>You Duxing turned his gaze towards Yi Feng, regarding the fact that a Human Immortal disciple had come to his Star Peak, how could he, as an old disciple of Star Peak, not know about it.
<br><br>Of course, he did not mean to look down on Yi Feng.
<br><br>How to say, is also his senior brother.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, it's exactly me."
<br><br>Yi Feng arched his hand and smiled, "I came here this time because I want to ask Senior Brother You a question, and I hope Senior Brother You can solve the problem."
<br><br>"Senior brother, feel free to speak!"
<br><br>You Duxing said indifferently.
<br><br>"It's like this, I picked a set of low-level immortal techniques in the Immortal Technique Pavilion yesterday, and it happens to be the One Thought Finger that Senior Brother You has cultivated." Yi Feng explained.
<br><br>"Oh, do you want me to teach you how to cultivate the One Thought Finger?" You Duxing frowned and said, "I'm afraid it's not a coincidence for the time being, I'll be leaving the sect on a mission in a couple of days."
<br><br>"Brother You misunderstood, I am not asking you to teach me, I just want to ask, is it difficult to cultivate this One Thought Finger?" Yi Feng looked at You Duxing hopefully.
<br><br>"Difficult!"
<br><br>Slightly pensive, You Duxing solemnly spoke out.
<br><br>"Then can you tell me, how much time did it take for our Sun Moon Sect, the fastest to cultivate the Perfect One Thought Finger?" Yi Feng asked again, "How long did it take for Senior Brother You to cultivate the perfection again?"
<br><br>"Although the One Thought Finger is a low-level immortal technique, it is still in the category of immortal techniques, even in the hands of Xuan Immortals, it can play a huge role, and according to the records, the fastest person in the history of our clan to cultivate the Perfect One Thought Finger was the previous generation's patriarch, which took exactly one year."
<br><br>"And I, it took three years."
<br><br>You Dohang is quite a bit disappointed, obviously for his three years to cultivate the One Thought finger some dissatisfaction.
<br><br>Hearing these words, Yi Feng's heart immediately rejoiced.
<br><br>Dog system ah dog system ah, you are really too cute.
<br><br>I've been a loser for 20 years, you finally let me bully up, I thought I could only be a loser when I came to the immortal world, but I didn't expect it to be the beginning of my rise.
<br><br>I Yi Feng such a day to cultivate the perfection of a thought finger of the supreme genius, will step on this immortal world ......
<br><br>Yi Feng crossed his arms, his heart was full of vigor, his heart was all kinds of crooked, and he was so excited that he almost whistled to the sky.
<br><br>He was so excited that he could hardly help himself.
<br><br>Then the fame of the immortal world, let's start with this Sun Moon Sect.
<br><br>Unable to help, he turned his gaze towards You Duxing and asked leisurely, "Then senior brother You, may I ask, if one succeeds in cultivating the One Thought Finger in one night, what is the concept?"
<br><br>"Would such a person be called a supreme genius?"
