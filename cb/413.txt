Sky.
<br><br>Gradually floated a heavy snow.
<br><br>The ground was covered with a thick layer, and everywhere was white.
<br><br>A few dozen miles outside of Guan Tong City.
<br><br>A man with a silver fang mask appeared in the wind and snow, the first step is still a mile away, the next step will be within a hundred feet, like a ghost.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>He stopped.
<br><br>"A bunch of trash."
<br><br>Under the silver fangs, a deep voice came out.
<br><br>With a wave of his big hand, the wind and snow within a hundred feet radius lifted away, revealing the original yellow soil on the ground.
<br><br>On top of the yellow soil, seven corpses were lying. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Wake up."
<br><br>He waved his palm again, and seven mysterious forces spread out from his hand, diffusing towards the seven corpses.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The seven corpses did not react in the slightest.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>Under the mask, a puzzled voice was revealed.
<br><br>Immediately after the palm of his hand moved again, seven more forces diffused towards it.
<br><br>But things did not go as expected, the seven corpses still did not move.
<br><br>"Actually, it failed?!"
<br><br>Beneath the fang mask, revealed a touch of gloom, after the voice fell, actually directly tore through space and walked in.
<br><br>A blood-red land.
<br><br>Here space is all distorted, surrounded by covered with chaos.
<br><br>After the masked man arrived here, he directly knelt on the ground.
<br><br>"Lord Perdition, the Spiral Organization has been destroyed."
<br><br>"The Raise the Dead technique has also failed."
<br><br>"It is estimated that a great person has come from the North Sea, and I am worried ...... that it is afraid that it will be detrimental to you, Lord."
<br><br>He said respectfully.
<br><br>"I know, not enough evidence, for the time being, let them go, it just so happens that I still need to sleep for a while!"
<br><br>Amidst the blood red, a deep voice came out, but no one could trace the source, and he did not take the masked man's words or the so-called big shot to heart in the slightest.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The masked man turned around and disappeared.
<br><br>The space also then regained its calm.
<br><br>"Damn, I used thirteen bags of gold coins and the clan didn't get in, what a big loss!"
<br><br>Cursing Yi Feng wrapped his thin body and went into a broken temple to save money.
<br><br>Put down the flame beads as a stove, and find firewood to cook up tea, also intended to warm up a body.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"Finally, it's ready."
<br><br>Looking at the already boiling tea, Yi Feng smiled faintly and was just about to pick it up when a long-lost voice came from his mind.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host tea art to reach the realm of comparison with God, complete all skill tasks, reward halo."
<br><br>"At the same time the system will be upgraded."
<br><br>"The system is being upgraded ......"
<br><br>Hearing this voice, Yi Feng immediately jumped up with excitement.
<br><br>Aura reward he knew before, but the system upgrade is a complete surprise to him!
<br><br>"I just don't know what use the halo actually has."
<br><br>"What's more, I don't know what the system upgrade will be able to bring me."
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart was filled with expectation.
<br><br>"Congratulations host, the system upgrade is complete."
<br><br>After a long time, the system finally came with a voice.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, Yi Feng couldn't wait and asked, "System, please ask what is the use of the halo."
<br><br>"Please host explore by yourself."
<br><br>The system's voice came and then directly fell silent.
<br><br>Yi Feng skimmed his mouth and had to explore on his own.
<br><br>"Halo, come."
<br><br>He shouted.
<br><br>However, to no avail.
<br><br>"Halo."
<br><br>He raised his palm and shouted again.
<br><br>Finally, a golden glow emerged from the top of his head.
<br><br>"Aaaah, there's a reaction."
<br><br>Yi Feng was excited.
<br><br>"Just what exactly is the use of this halo?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but murmur, "Could it be that this halo can prevent me from being hurt?"
<br><br>Saying that, he gritted his teeth and picked up a wooden board on the ground and knocked it towards his head.
<br><br>The halo didn't have the slightest effect, and the plank knocked out a large bag on Yi Feng's head.
<br><br>"Grass."
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his head and cursed.
<br><br>"It doesn't seem to be a protective halo, could it be that the words came out?" Yi Feng made another attempt, stood up and walked out of the temple door.
<br><br>"Give me rain."
<br><br>He shouted towards the sky with the halo above his head.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, the clouds in the sky began to sweep up at a speed visible to the naked eye, surging madly.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes widened, his expression excited to the extreme, and he stared up expectantly at the high sky.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Among the clouds, there were countless drops sprinkled down.
<br><br>"Ahahaha, it's really the word that comes out."
<br><br>Yi Feng stared deathly at the drops sprinkling down from the sky and shouted out excitedly.
<br><br>Words out of law.
<br><br>It's really the words that follow the law!
<br><br>This skill is really too awesome!
<br><br>Under the excitement, even the cold Yi Feng is not afraid, open arms waiting for the rain sprinkled down from the sky.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This is the rain he called out ah.
<br><br>En?
<br><br>Just then, Yi Feng blinked his eyes and looked at the rain that landed and suddenly felt something was wrong.
<br><br>"Why is it so big?"
<br><br>"Grass, it's not rain."
<br><br>"It's hail."
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Grass, it hurts."
<br><br>In a flash, Yi Feng was smashed by the huge hailstones nose-to-nose, and rushed back to the broken temple with his head in his hands.
<br><br>"Grass grass grass."
<br><br>Sitting in the temple, Yi Feng touched his head of bags, his face gloomy to the extreme.
