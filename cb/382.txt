"Just, originally did not think you Dong Sheng this group of trash can help what, in or out also does not matter, you are the head of a few listen to the words." The man in green said icily.
<br><br>Hearing that, the East Victory crowd's face held ugly.
<br><br>But forced by the pressure given by the man in green, they could only lower their heads and say, "Please also ask senior to command."
<br><br>"We were ordered by Lord Duan to come to East Victory to investigate the matter of the ancient statue, and may stay here for a while, so you have to fully cooperate with us during this time."
<br><br>"The first thing is to find a place for us to stay."
<br><br>Saying that, he turned his gaze to one of the beautiful women.
<br><br>"I heard that you, the Valley of Absolute Color, only accept female disciples?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes senior."
<br><br>The beautiful woman's face was ugly as she bowed her head and agreed.
<br><br>"Fine, you go back and make arrangements, this emperor will stay in your Jade-Like Valley for the next few days." The man in green said with a commanding tone.
<br><br>The unquestionable tone of voice made the beautiful woman feel very harsh. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>She also knew that there were many female disciples of the Jedi Valley who would suffer next.
<br><br>But she had to agree.
<br><br>"The second thing ......"
<br><br>The man in green spoke again.
<br><br>The crowd panicked in their hearts and hurriedly turned their eyes to him.
<br><br>"What are you guys afraid of?"
<br><br>The man in green asked in a cold voice.
<br><br>"No, nothing ......"
<br><br>The crowd swallowed and stammered, trying their best to hide the uneasiness on their faces.
<br><br>"Hmph, a bunch of trash."
<br><br>The man in green's face was filled with disdain, and said in a deep voice: "The second thing is that I need you to find me a map, especially one of your Eastern Victory called the South Sand Region."
<br><br>Seeing that it was just a map, the crowd was relieved.
<br><br>One of the old men hurriedly took out a map and said in a low voice, "Senior, it just so happens that I have one in my hand."
<br><br>The man in green took the map and frowned as he examined it.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, please give the order."
<br><br>The six subordinates behind him came forward in due time.
<br><br>"A month ago, Lord Duan learned through astrological orientation divination that the ancient statue was inside this Pingjiang City in Nansha."
<br><br>The man in green nodded with his finger at a small corner on the map, and a voice came out leisurely.
<br><br>"But yesterday before we left, Lord Duan re-divined once again, but completely lost the trace of the ancient statue, it seems to be shielded by some power, but no matter what, this ancient statue must have appeared in Pingjiang City, then this is also the place we must go."
<br><br>"So the six of you set out immediately and go to Pingjiang City, I don't care whether you inspect it openly or secretly, make sure to find the clues of the ancient statue."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The six nodded their heads respectfully.
<br><br>"I'll go to the Valley of the Absolute Colors and wait for your news, but remember, the ancient statue is not trivial, it's a big plan for Lord Duan to see the sun again, so you can't be sloppy, so don't act rashly when you find the clue, come back and report to me first."
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>Six people nodded respectfully, then turned into six streams of light, disappearing towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The man in green, on the other hand, sneered and followed the beautiful woman from Jedi Valley, rushing to Jedi Valley.
<br><br>Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Bao Feng Restaurant.
<br><br>"Master, why are you all sad lately?" Luo Lanxue looked at Lu Qingshan at the side and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Alas, I'm thinking about Mister!"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan poured down a cup of wine and shook his head after drinking it, "In recent months, my visits with sir have become less and less, I'm afraid sir has forgotten about me."
<br><br>"Since you want to find Mr., then go find him?" Luo Lanxue said.
<br><br>"Alas, a little girl is a little girl after all." Lu Qingshan shook his head with a sad face and said, "Mr. kind of person, how can I go to him when I have nothing to do, not to mention nagging him, I myself am really embarrassed ah!"
<br><br>"Also right."
<br><br>"Sir is what kind of person, how can we climb high."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue also similarly bitter down the face, the corners of the eyes with a strong sorrow.
<br><br>"Alas, apprentice, I also know that your mind." Looking at Luo Lanxue's appearance, Lu Qingshan sighed: "Many times I saw you holding Mr. book in a daze, often in the Qingshan cliff heavy heart, but this thing ah, is simply impossible, give up!"
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>Luo Lanxue nodded dully, eyes full of darkness.
<br><br>She had never revealed this mind, but she did not expect that it was still seen by the master.
<br><br>See out just see out, she also never thought about how, the heart thinking about is also quite satisfied.
<br><br>"Let's drink a toast, master and disciple!" Lu Qingshan said bitterly: "In the future or less to find Mr., afraid of his annoyance, his kindness we remember just fine, the future Mr. if there is a need, we do our best to do."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue nodded lightly and raised her wine glass.
<br><br>Just as they were about to tilt their heads and drink, a voice came from outside.
<br><br>"Boss, taking customers, big business."
<br><br>Hearing this voice, Lu Qingshan's master and disciple were invigorated and hurriedly got up to look towards the door.
<br><br>Sure enough, a familiar figure walked in.
<br><br>He is still in white robes, looks spotless, always with a gentle smile.
<br><br>At a glance, he made people feel close.
<br><br>"Sir, it's sir."
<br><br>The two men hurriedly and excitedly were about to welcome him over.
<br><br>But just move a step, found Yi Feng behind a rowdy walk into the big dozens of people.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan footsteps a beat.
<br><br>Eyes carefully surveyed these people, full of shock.
<br><br>"What's wrong with the master, not going to greet the gentleman?" Luo Lanxue asked urgently.
<br><br>"Alas, I also want to ah, but look at those people behind the gentleman ......"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan shook his head and stopped for a while.
<br><br>"What, what's wrong?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue doubtfully sounded out.
<br><br>"They are not as simple as you think ah, I'm afraid this is dozens of Martial Emperors!" Lu Qingshan said.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue's red lips opened, almost did not exclaim out.
<br><br>"Here sir, there is nothing surprising to see anything."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan sighed, although his strength was not high, and he could not even see through these people's cultivation at all, but he had followed Yi Feng for so long before, his eyesight and improvement in all aspects was remarkable.
<br><br>He could see at a glance that these people were all characters who could make Dong Sheng tremble three times with a single move.
<br><br>Even, as his eyesight improved, he also found out more and more how uncomplicated this Pingjiang City under the jurisdiction of his Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>Obviously it is his jurisdiction, he as the boss, walking in the Pingjiang City do not dare to speak loudly.
<br><br>"So, he is casually surrounded by Martial Emperors, and we, master and disciple, with this kind of cultivation, how do you think we can meaningfully get over there?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan said bitterly: "In front of him, we are not even small shrimps, so it is better not to get together to cause trouble for Mr.!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue very agree with Lu Qingshan's words, nodding with an even gloomier expression.
<br><br>In front of Mr., in front of these dozens of Martial Emperors, what are they worth?
<br><br>In the eyes of sir, I'm afraid that the two of them, master and disciple, are not even passing guests, right?
