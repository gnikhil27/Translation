"Big brother, you, ugh ......"
<br><br>Burial Five looked at Burial One's move with complicated eyes and sighed helplessly.
<br><br>But he still went.
<br><br>Not that he disregarded his brotherly feelings, just that he firmly believed in the feeling of the underworld. After all, this feeling is not nebulous to them cultivators.
<br><br>Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>Yi Feng was lying on a recliner, leisurely squinting his eyes.
<br><br>He was not sleeping, but consciously or unconsciously sizing up the disciples.
<br><br>Bull-riding bull-riding, mud-playing mud-playing ......
<br><br>For these oddballs, Yi Feng is the more he thinks about it, the more wrong it is.
<br><br>It's too damned wrong.
<br><br>It is reasonable to say that a normal youth joined the sect, not a single-minded desire to cultivate, eager to gongfa? Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>So at first Yi Feng was somewhat avoiding these disciples.
<br><br>After all, if these people are looking for him to ask for gongfa, he really does not know what to do, at least have to waste half of the mouth to fool.
<br><br>However, with the fifty flyers sent out some time ago, the disciples have grown to sixty or seventy, but none of them came to him to ask for advice on cultivation, and none of them showed the slightest motivation to cultivate.
<br><br>This should not be ah.
<br><br>What kind of person is not willing to cultivate after entering the sect, and chases novels and comics in the book collection every day?
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>Suddenly, Yi Feng thought of something and slapped his thighs and sat up violently.
<br><br>These disciples themselves have ordinary qualifications, they never thought they could cultivate, they all belong to the kind of role of waiting for death.
<br><br>So they came to him to make a living?
<br><br>When you think about it.
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly felt that eight or nine is not far from the truth.
<br><br>Good guys.
<br><br>Really good guys.
<br><br>This group of small coin cubs really good ruthless ah, so they did not want to start at all to cultivate, are here to stroke his wool.
<br><br>For a moment, even Yi Feng, who was carrying a huge amount of money, felt offended at once.
<br><br>"Come on people."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted at once.
<br><br>"May I ask what is it, sir?"
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang asked respectfully.
<br><br>"Gather all the disciples to me."
<br><br>Yi Feng ordered with a sullen face.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang hurriedly did as he was told, and then started to go gather all the disciples.
<br><br>In the Book Depository Pavilion.
<br><br>Burial Five was like a sealed demon immersed in it.
<br><br>Since he had joined the Heaven and Earth Sect as he wished, he had been soaking in the Book Depository all day long.
<br><br>Everything in the book collection pavilion makes him feel astonished.
<br><br>Although he hadn't found his own Dao yet, it had made his cultivation and other aspects skyrocket.
<br><br>"Although I have not found my Dao now, this vast Book Collection Pavilion will surely be able to find what I need."
<br><br>Burial Five's eyes shone with a brilliant light.
<br><br>He was very glad that he had steadfastly come down and joined the Heaven and Earth Sect with the flyer.
<br><br>Otherwise, how would he have such a blessing today?
<br><br>"Alas, it would be great if the four brothers could be here together."
<br><br>"Compared to this Heaven and Earth Sect, what's that Immortal River Chaos Tablet, just the Dao contained in this language book in my hand, I'm afraid it's not something that can be compared to that Immortal River Chaos Tablet."
<br><br>At that moment, the voice of Qing Huan Xiang Hong Zhong came from outside.
<br><br>"The patriarch has an order, all disciples go forward to meet him at the Heaven and Earth Hall."
<br><br>"Sovereign has an order, all disciples go forward to meet him at the Hall of Heaven and Earth."
<br><br>The voice came, the Hidden Scripture Pavilion, even if the crowd of people who are still engrossed in it, have also got up. Outside planting vegetables also put down the hoe, riding a bull is also jumped off the green bull ......
<br><br>Burial five is also a bright eyes.
<br><br>He also met the master when he was a teacher, when that side of him was astonishing, today is finally the privilege to see again.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>All the disciples were gathered in the square in front of the Heaven and Earth Hall.
<br><br>Each one of them was respectful, waiting for Yi Feng's lecture.
<br><br>"How have you guys been, practicing lately?"
<br><br>Yi Feng got up, looked around at the crowd, and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>No one answered back.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Although he then did not into think these people can practice a what, but which into the door he did not lull some, play a good foundation work.
<br><br>Look at this group of things, it seems that no one will be his words on the heart ah.
<br><br>"You, who is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng casually pointed to a disciple and shouted, "Use your strongest strength and slash for me."
<br><br>"It's Master."
<br><br>The thirty-eighth ranked disciple respectfully stepped out, raised the long knife in his hand, and with a loud cry, slashed in front.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>A faint wind sound rang out in space.
<br><br>Seeing this, many senior brothers nodded their heads.
<br><br>This slash.
<br><br>It was pretty good.
<br><br>To be able to flood the space on the island with a hint of wind, it seems that this thirty-eight is indeed the king of swords.
<br><br>But Yi Feng did not say anything with a sullen face, but pointed to another person and shouted again, "You, come out and hit a round of this wooden man pile."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>The disciple ranked twenty-nine came out again, put on a serious look, and hit the wooden man pile next to him.
<br><br>The wooden human pile slowly rotated, but this disciple was already sweating profusely and appeared to be extremely strained.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Burial five's eyes were blazing with enthusiasm.
<br><br>Secretly surprised this twenty-nine senior brother is really powerful.
<br><br>The wooden pile in front of you is at least top-level immortal weapon level, which contains the power of the great dao, and can feedback the power of the strike.
<br><br>Anyway, if you let him fight, it would be great to be able to rotate it.
<br><br>"Change one."
<br><br>Yi Feng remained expressionless and called out for the next attempt.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The next one.
<br><br>The next next one.
<br><br>A row of seven or eight more to change, with the previous twenty-nine are similar.
<br><br>Yi Feng, whose face was so gloomy that water was coming out, finally couldn't help himself and cursed viciously, "Waste, a bunch of waste, total waste."
<br><br>The crowd heard the sound and lowered their heads in shame, not daring to have the slightest look of refutation.
<br><br>Uh?
<br><br>Is this also a waste?
<br><br>The newcomer Burial Five was a bit puzzled.
<br><br>These senior brothers and sisters, obviously already good and strong, why would the master still call them waste.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>He finally knew.
<br><br>The furious Yi Feng kicked on the wooden man pile, which spun up rapidly and then fell to the ground ......
<br><br>It fell apart.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Burial Five was so shocked that he felt his scalp to explode.
<br><br>I never thought that the first time I saw the might of the master was such a scene.
<br><br>They can not even hit the wooden pile, at least the existence of the top immortal weapon, in the master lightly a kick, and fell apart?
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>Brother and sister so strong, in the eyes of the master is still waste.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>I have to cheer up ah.
<br><br>Otherwise, I can't even be a loser!
<br><br>Looking at this group of disciples with their heads down, Yi Feng's heart is even more nasty.
<br><br>Not a single bloody one.
<br><br>But where there is a little blood, was he yelled at waste not refute refutation?
<br><br>But now it is low head silently accept.
<br><br>What does this mean?
<br><br>It means that this group of disciples have been sitting and waiting for death to a certain level, has lost any fighting spirit.
<br><br>Today, to put it bluntly, he was deliberately gathered to test this group of people.
<br><br>And the test also confirmed his thoughts.
<br><br>This group of guys, is to mix the food, not even a little strong heart of the disciples.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes, look at this group of disciples is not good.
<br><br>Originally thought that when they can cultivate, each teach them a move and a half, and not in vain their expectations.
<br><br>Now it seems, teach a chicken hair.
<br><br>When a hundred people arrived, will have to be this group of waste to dispatch.
<br><br>No one will be left behind!
