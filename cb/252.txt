 At one time, the dark clouds pressed the sky and the mighty pressure was dense.
<br><br>The sky suddenly became gloomy for a thousand miles around, bringing a heavy pressure to the whole ground, and many living creatures prostrated and trembled under this pressure.
<br><br>"This weather, it really changes at the drop of a hat."
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head, he was not afraid, he must have been prepared for this time out, he had prepared two super big sun umbrellas long ago.
<br><br>Just pity these poopers.
<br><br>When it comes to the field, the rainstorm, it's a sour ......
<br><br>Ugh.
<br><br>Sit down and wait.
<br><br>"You guys sit down too!" Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>When they heard the words, the two of them nodded their heads, only looking at the high altitude pressure, they did not dare to relax in the slightest.
<br><br>Getting closer, the robbery clouds in the sky are getting denser and denser. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Then under the two people's nervous gaze, two lightning bolts as thick as a bucket slowly condensed out.
<br><br>"How terrifying!"
<br><br>The two people felt their scalps tingling, but without preparation, they didn't know what to do for a while, and in their hearts they could only hope that Yi Feng would make a move.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The thunderbolt was getting closer and closer.
<br><br>The two hearts stuck to their throats.
<br><br>Sir, how come you still don't do it?
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, Yi Feng suddenly stepped out from under the sun umbrella, thinking that it was going to rain soon, and cleaned up the guy who had made snake soup before.
<br><br>However, at the moment when Yi Feng stepped out of the sun umbrella, the two tilted down thunderbolts fiercely shook and the speed of descent plummeted.
<br><br>At this moment, the two thunderbolts appeared as if they had spiritual intelligence, revealing a fearful appearance.
<br><br>It was as if this figure, inherent with the gods, made them feel fearful.
<br><br>Then under the shocked gaze of Pork Rong, the two thunderbolts rolled in mid-air and instantly ran out of shadow.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This scene stunned the two people of Pork Rong.
<br><br>They originally thought that Yi Feng would be able to help them resolve this kind of thing that came down from the heavenly dao, even if he could help them, it would take some effort.
<br><br>But who would have thought that the emperor's fate heavenly calamity, actually directly by Mr. scared away?
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>What kind of divine tactics is this?
<br><br>This heavenly tribulation, it represents the heavenly dao!
<br><br>What kind of cultivation is the gentleman who was scared away by what the Heavenly Dao descended?
<br><br>The two felt that the highest cultivation they perceived was not even one ten thousandth of that of Mr.
<br><br>At this point.
<br><br>The two also found that their dantian had silently changed, and their strength had increased by an unknown number of times compared to before, in addition to the invisible control of a domain thing.
<br><br>Phew.
<br><br>The two of them could not slow down for a long time.
<br><br>I didn't expect that the Second Life Emperor Tribulation would be so easily passed.
<br><br>Sir is really terrifying as hell!
<br><br>Not long after, the ones who went out for convenience also came back, and originally their breakthrough was more than just this moment.
<br><br>But with Yi Feng out, they also have long prepared a formation that can briefly control the flow of time, and after the breakthrough inside the formation, it is only half an hour outside.
<br><br>However, half an hour is not too short.
<br><br>Easy Feng said with a black face, "You guys have been shitting for too long, aren't you afraid of getting hemorrhoids?"
<br><br>The faces of the people were embarrassed.
<br><br>"Sir, it's all our fault, we will improve next time, we will definitely improve." Wu Yonghong several people hurriedly apologized.
<br><br>And at the side, Li Yihan was like a chicken, not daring to say half a word.
<br><br>Just now she took advantage of Wu Yonghong and the others to enter the formation and witnessed the breakthrough of four Martial Saints, which had already given her enough shock.
<br><br>And she herself, too, had soared directly from the Martial King's realm to Martial Emperor, and that was with just a small sip.
<br><br>Only next she didn't dare to drink any more, with his cultivation level if he shivered another mouthful, even if the medicinal effect of this soup was tempered by Yi Feng more mildly, she couldn't hold on and could only bring the rest home in a container.
<br><br>"All right, keep hurrying!"
<br><br>Easy Feng took a look at the sky, thinking that the weather was still unpredictable, multiplying that it would not rain, and hastened to tell the crowd to hurry up.
<br><br>The crowd packed up their things and got ready to leave.
<br><br>On the occasion of leaving, Yi Feng wanted to take the pot of snake soup with him, but remembering that one by one they all had diarrhea, he kicked it over to the ground with no good grace.
<br><br>It took all morning to make this stuff.
<br><br>Not satisfied!
<br><br>The crowd took a look at it and was filled with complicated faces.
<br><br>This soup is more precious than even agarwood, yet this one said he kicked it over.
<br><br>Heart and liver hurt!
<br><br>But they also understood that to the gentleman, this is nothing at all, after all, he is able to make this soup anytime.
<br><br>A few miles away.
<br><br>Thousands of cultivators stood in the same place.
<br><br>In addition to the original Blowing Snow Villa, Wind Cloud Valley and the Royal Sword Sect, the later Heavenly Sword Sect, the Devil's Voice Sect and other family forces, large and small, all gathered here as well.
<br><br>All of them, with their hearts in their mouths.
<br><br>"Just now, was that an imperial destiny tribulation on that day just now?" Book Qinhua said with a palpitating heart.
<br><br>"That terrifying movement, I think it was." Fifth Longkong said.
<br><br>"Just what exactly happened there, there were actually two emperor fate tribulations at the same time, there were two Martial Emperors breaking through at the same time!" Yun Xian Que also said in shock at the side.
<br><br>The crowd shook their heads, no one knew what had happened.
<br><br>And what they couldn't figure out even more was that the emperor fate tribulation had clearly landed, yet it had turned back again.
<br><br>But they knew.
<br><br>The place where the emperor's destiny tribulation descended was exactly where Yi Feng and the others were camped.
<br><br>"Report, those lords have already left."
<br><br>At this time, a disciple came with the news.
<br><br>Almost the moment the voice fell, almost everyone moved.
<br><br>Scramble towards the front.
<br><br>And the fastest ones were Li Shuhua, the head of the Li family, Yang Tianyu of the Royal Sword Sect, Xue Qinzhu of the Magic Sound Sect, Fifth Tianming, the head of the Blowing Snow Villa, and Yun Haotian of the Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>These people are all at the top of Nansha.
<br><br>They were the first ones to arrive at Yi Feng's campsite.
<br><br>"Here, there doesn't seem to be anything special!"
<br><br>Yun Haotian observed the surroundings and murmured.
<br><br>"Yeah, but let's see again, maybe that gentleman left a chance." Yang Tianyu said.
<br><br>"That's a good point, even what that gentleman casually discarded may be of endless use to us." Xue Qinzhu lamented, she kind of knew better than anyone how big this one's hand was.
<br><br>Maybe dropping a piece of paper to wipe their buttocks and taking it back could make their Magic Sound Sect prosper for ten thousand years.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Just then, the fifth Tianming picked up a pot on the ground and looked at the little bit of unturned soup left inside the pot and revealed a thoughtful look.
<br><br>"This is ......"
