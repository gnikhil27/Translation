 "I can have what plan." Yi Feng lamented, said with a helpless face: "For the time being, I can only keep this mu of land to make a living, of course, if I can receive a few more disciples, that is also excellent!"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain nodded, slightly disappointed in his heart.
<br><br>The reason why he asked, in fact, is also expected to be able to ask Yi Feng about the future direction of the big picture, if you can know one or two, then his master and disciple is on a shortcut.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's words, it seems to be answered, but said nothing.
<br><br>Since Yi Feng did not want to reveal, then he naturally did not dare to ask more questions.
<br><br>However, today's success in borrowing the sword, is already a success, after a burst of pleasantries, the two hastened to say goodbye.
<br><br>After walking far away from the martial school, the two of them regained their breath and flew towards the Castle Peak Sect as two streams of light.
<br><br>Just after they returned to the Castle Peak Gate, the old ancestor of Castle Peak hurriedly walked towards the inside.
<br><br>"Senior uncle, wait for me, wait for me?" Zhu Yun followed behind the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak with a flattering face.
<br><br>"What for?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan asked in an unpleasant manner as he returned to his senses.
<br><br>"Hehehe." Zhu Yun rubbed his palms and said with a smile, "Senior Uncle, can I see that sword?"
<br><br>"What do you have to look at?" Old Man Qing Shan drank.
<br><br>"Just one look, just one look." Zhu Yun bowed and said in a humble manner.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan snorted coldly and impatiently took his sword out.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>Once the blade came out, it brought up a different aura, Zhu Yun's small eyes narrowed into a slit, and carefully raised his palm to touch it, and in a flash, the old ancestor of Castle Peak put the blade away.
<br><br>"Well look finished, I'm going to close for a day, notify the clan's top brass, tomorrow's meeting."
<br><br>Said, the old ancestor of the green hill into a stream of light and has disappeared.
<br><br>The palm hanging in mid-air Zhu Yun's face twitched, shattered in the direction of the Old Ancestor Qingshan left, but still did not dare to neglect his orders, and hastily notified the clan's people to hold a meeting tomorrow.
<br><br>"Doggie, come here."
<br><br>Lying in the courtyard, Yi Feng beckoned towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>Ao Qing wagged his tail with an attentive face and came to Yi Feng's feet with narrowed eyes.
<br><br>Jerking off the dog, Yi Feng's daily routine.
<br><br>After jerking off, Yi Feng stretched, and then took off his shirt, revealing the smooth and healthy skin.
<br><br>"Make a fist, do not move again, the tendons are about to fall apart."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng stretched stretching muscles and bones, walked to the side and has settled.
<br><br>Then a set of Shaolin fist flowing, although he did not cultivate, but the fist has been to the level of God, he played is also the wind, a move is a sense of beauty.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>On the side, Ao Qing stared at his eyes, his mouth could not help a howl, simply excited about to go crazy.
<br><br>From the moment Yi Feng started, the surrounding space has been filled with martial intent, obviously the stance is not complicated, obviously a simple punch, but permeated with an extremely profound feeling.
<br><br>Unknowingly, Ao Qing seemed to have comprehended something, and the realm directly broke through a level.
<br><br>Gradually, though, he became increasingly unable to understand.
<br><br>What was even more peculiar was that he had wanted to write down this set of fists, but found that he could not recall what moves Yi Feng had fought before.
<br><br>And at this time, the set of punches had been fought by Yi Feng to a white-hot state, and when Ao Qing excitedly tried to look at it again, he found that his head was dizzy and the strong impact of martial intent almost burst his whole body.
<br><br>Ao Qing hurriedly closed his eyes, knowing that this was simply not a level realm he could salivate over.
<br><br>Gradually, Yi Feng finally closed his momentum.
<br><br>"Comfortable."
<br><br>Wiped the sweat on his forehead, not exercising for a long time, playing a set of punches is simply soothing to the extreme.
<br><br>Looking at the appearance of the dog next to him, Yi Feng smiled and laughed after rubbing his dog's head: "How about it, your master is great, right?"
<br><br>"Ow."
<br><br>Ao Qing barked twice.
<br><br>"Little kid, still smart." Yi Feng took a sip of water and laughed, "In that case, I'll play another set."
<br><br>Putting down the teacup, Yi Feng reentered the meditation.
<br><br>It was hard to enter this state, more exercise is also excellent, another set of internal fist slowly unfolded in his hands.
<br><br>Ao Qing's face was ugly.
<br><br>Seniors ah seniors, I know your good intentions, want to cultivate me, but you old man, also have to see if I can hold up ah!
<br><br>Just now that set of Shaolin fist has made him dizzy and about to burst, the result Yi Feng and another set of more profound fist.
<br><br>This fist, he is not even dare to look!
<br><br>Of course, not do not want to, the key is to have that life to see ah.
<br><br>A set of internal fist down, Yi Feng sweat, but feel extraordinarily comfortable, after taking a shower, Yi Feng re-lay down on the recliner.
<br><br>Subsequently, the old ancestor of the Castle Peak gave him the flame bead took out, placed in the hand to figure out ......
