Although named Heaven Devouring Emperor, but Ao Zhong's strength can not only be as simple as Demon Emperor, but has reached the realm of Demon Sect.
<br><br>Therefore, even in the face of Ao Bi Fang, a group of experts, he was fearless, and the leader's might spread out invisibly, pressing towards Ao Bi Fang and the others.
<br><br>"Bi Fang Demon Sect, this emperor is dealing with the clan's important matters, why are you leading so many people to disturb me for no reason?" Ao Zhong said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang said with the same cold face and said in a deep voice, "I'm afraid there is nothing more important than us coming to you right now."
<br><br>"What do you mean?" Ao Zhong frowned.
<br><br>"Still asking me what I mean, do you know what treacherous thing your son Ao Qing has done?" Ao Bi Fang questioned in a cold voice.
<br><br>"My son Ao Qing?"
<br><br>Ao Zhong sneered and said, "Ao Bi Fang, I suspect you have nothing better to do than to eat, it is well known that my son has long been expelled from the tribe, can you find a better reason for your trouble?"
<br><br>"You go, this emperor has no time to leave you."
<br><br>Saying that, Ao Zhong waved his palm, full of impatience, and prepared to leave. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Humph, I don't have the heart to joke with you." Ao Bi Fang said coldly, "Do you know that your treacherous son broke the intact body of my Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan's Holy Maiden."
<br><br>As soon as these words fell, Ao Zhong, who was sweeping the air and preparing to leave, almost didn't fall down from mid-air.
<br><br>"Are you talking about Ao Qingcheng?" Ao Zhong asked in shock.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's mouth let out an eerily cold voice.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>However, Ao Zhong laughed violently and mocked loudly, "Ao Bi Fang, everyone knows the wolfish ambition of your Red Sun lineage, always spying on the status of my royal lineage and thinking of ways to mess with us every day, but can you find a reason that is a little more convincing."
<br><br>"Say my waste third son screwed Ao Qingcheng, really put your mother's fart, you also have to have someone to believe ah!"
<br><br>After saying that, Ao Zhong impatiently gave them a white glance, thinking that the instantaneous seconds just now must have caused his wife's displeasure, rather than tangling with these old pickpockets, it would be better to coax his wife.
<br><br>"I'm not kidding with you!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang gritted his teeth crunching, word by word, an ice cold voice came out.
<br><br>At the same time, the line of people behind him all stared at Ao Zhong with deadly eyes, flashing with thick hatred.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the original did not believe Ao Zhong's heart and soul trembled violently.
<br><br>Looking at Ao Bi Fang and others with wide eyes, asked incredulously: "What you say, is it true? My son, really screwed Ao Qingcheng?"
<br><br>Without waiting for Ao Bi Fang and the others to answer, looking at their faces, Ao Zhong instantly determined the truth of this matter.
<br><br>Can't help but, Ao Zhong couldn't help but let out a "poof".
<br><br>Then let out a loud laugh.
<br><br>"Ha ......"
<br><br>"Hahahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>"Niu, my son Niu ah, really deep your father's true heritage, worthy of my Ao Zhong's son, ha ha ......"
<br><br>However, Ao Zhong's laughter, but let Ao Bi Fang and other people's faces gloomy can drip out of water, but also have the silk killing intent straight out.
<br><br>"Ao Zhong, you're still laughing, what do you mean?"
<br><br>"This treacherous son of yours broke Qingcheng's intact body, which is tantamount to destroying my Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan, not only do you not give us an explanation, but you are still laughing here, how on earth do you, this Heaven Devouring Emperor, serve?"
<br><br>"That's right, do you know that Qingcheng is the Saintess of my Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan, and is responsible for the future of my Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan!"
<br><br>For a moment, Ao Bi Fang and the others' faces were filled with anger, and voices of scolding and admonishing were transmitted towards Ao Zhong.
<br><br>"The future of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan?"
<br><br>At that, Ao Zhong put away his smile and snorted, coldly said: "This emperor is not yet dead, talk about the future, you really put gold on Ao Qingcheng's face, to really say, I think he is the future of your Red Sun lineage, right?"
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang drank in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Nothing, who doesn't know that you want to rely on Ao Qingcheng and turn the Red Sun lineage into a royal lineage?" Ao Zhong bellowed in a silent manner.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang was said by Ao Zhong, but his face did not look embarrassed at all, instead, he said with a straight face, "Since ancient times, the position of Heaven Devouring Emperor is always occupied by those who have the ability, Qingcheng, as the number one in the young generation of Heaven Devouring Demon Wolves, even if she leads my Red Sun lineage to become an imperial lineage in the future, it is also natural and righteous."
<br><br>"Humph, then you also wait until this emperor dies!"
<br><br>Ao Zhong snorted angrily.
<br><br>"Ao Zhong, this clan does not want to argue with you about this, the matter of that trash Ao Qing, you must give us an account today!" Ao Bi Fang shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>"Not to mention that you are the Heaven Devouring Emperor, your son has done such a treacherous thing, you must give an account!"
<br><br>In a moment, the crowd behind Ao Bi Fang also exerted pressure at this moment.
<br><br>"Saying?"
<br><br>Ao Zhong let out a cold laugh, "I still want to ask you guys for a statement, my family Qing'er is so pure, hell knows if that Ao Qingcheng of yours seduced my family Qing'er!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>When Ao Zhong's words fell, he was so angry that Ao Bi Fang almost vomited blood.
<br><br>Such shameless words, how can you say that!
