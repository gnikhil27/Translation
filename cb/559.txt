And then, he carefully opened the book once again.
<br><br>Read the last few lines, carefully, back and forth countless times.
<br><br>Trying to find out the points of knowledge that he misunderstood in reading.
<br><br>In the end, what came out was nothing but a head full of question marks.
<br><br>He suddenly jumped up, the book fell to the ground fiercely, a foot stomped on it.
<br><br>"Your mother's broken system let me go to the immortal world! I go to the immortal world and the lowest level!" He was so angry that his feet tensed up and jumped up to stomp.
<br><br>"What's the fucking difference with the mortals here in the universe spiral dead mother watermelon rind?!!!"
<br><br>A rolling roar of anger came from the depths of the earth.
<br><br>Outside the small island, the entire Immortal River Continent shook. A monstrous earthquake swept through all directions.
<br><br>Mountains collapsed and waves swept the sea.

<br><br>......
<br><br>Just after informing the disciples, out of the island ready to buy the three WuYongHong was a shaking shaking eyes and head swelling!
<br><br>It's hard to stabilize your body, "Quickly, go see Mr.!"
<br><br>Once inside the island, only to find that the island is not at all.
<br><br>After thinking about it, Wu Yonghong and others are still ready to go to Yi Feng to report.
<br><br>Knocked on the door.
<br><br>"Sir?"
<br><br>Inside, Yi Feng had quieted down.
<br><br>A sullen face silent.
<br><br>Looking up through the door without using his divine sense, he could hear that it was Wu Yonghong's voice.
<br><br>Just in time, he also had something to order.
<br><br>"Coming." He opened his mouth, his voice was somber and reticent, "Let all those disciples not come back. From today onwards, I'm going to be in seclusion."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong answered.
<br><br>"Is there anything else?"
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>"Go down."
<br><br>"Yes." Wu Yonghong and the others retreated.
<br><br>Chu Wild Lion followed behind, and couldn't help but open his mouth and wonder, "It looks like sir is just waiting for the three of us to go over."
<br><br>Before they could speak in the past, they started to order.
<br><br>This is the meaning of knowing they would go over a long time ago.
<br><br>"In that case, could that mountainous commotion just now be what sir meant when he summoned us to go over there?"
<br><br>"Even the clan meeting is not open. It seems like something has upset the gentleman."
<br><br>Several people were talking while walking down the mountain.
<br><br>Martial Hall.
<br><br>In the dry well of this matter, a skeleton abruptly jumped up.
<br><br>His extremely weak voice came from the well.
<br><br>"Brother Mon, ninety-nine ...... me ......"
<br><br>At the well not to eat or drink day and night guard the dog several people, heard this weak voice, each of them are excited.
<br><br>"Big brother big brother, you finally came out ah!"
<br><br>Several people said, combined efforts to push away the stones on the well.
<br><br>With all their strength, they only pushed open a small crack.
<br><br>Fortunately, the skeleton below Ben Wei a little strength, with a few people to move the boulder away a third.
<br><br>"Brothers, fish my head up first ......"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!"
<br><br>The ghost floated down and held the skull of Bone Ben Wei up.
<br><br>He also had to go down and hold the other bones up one by one, but was stopped by a voice from Bones Benway.
<br><br>"Stop hugging, run, run, run, run!"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei said, the head has hurriedly jumped out to go out.
<br><br>"Big brother, your body don't want it?!" The dog couldn't help but call out.
<br><br>"The body itself will find over, run, run, if the master now back, we are dead!"
<br><br>"Then it will not be the usual small fight ah ......" he muttered, anxiously.
<br><br>Dogs and other will understand, hurried to follow the skeleton Ben Wei. A few people out of the martial arts school door, a slip of smoke and disappeared.
<br><br>Ten thousand miles away.
<br><br>Five people walked in the desert.
<br><br>"Brother, where should we go now?" Dog looked around and frowned, "This shitty place, but we just robbed so many gold coins, we have to find a place to squander it!"
<br><br>"Yeah."
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei dragged his chin and said thoughtfully, "This time out, one is to escape the destruction of the master, the second is to have to take advantage of this time to use up the gold coins."
<br><br>"So, we should go to a place where the master will not go, and there should be people, can be fast and easy, and use up the gold coins before going back."
<br><br>Skull Benevolent said, and then he laughed.
<br><br>"I know where to go." He said with a clear mind.
<br><br>"Where?"
<br><br>"The Immortal World."
<br><br>The eyes of the few people behind him lit up.
<br><br>"Big brother is mighty! Big brother is wise!"
