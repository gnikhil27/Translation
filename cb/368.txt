But in the face of the three people's attitudes and rambling laughter, Milk Leopard Li slowly and methodically emitted a serious voice.
<br><br>"What the three great commanders said is good."
<br><br>"They can indeed break the sky, and they can indeed create immortals with their bare hands."
<br><br>The three demons were instantly stunned.
<br><br>Turning their gazes towards Milk Leopard Li, they then laughed out loud at the same time.
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>"Milk Leopard Li ah Milk Leopard Li, you are really too disappointing to us, not to mention that you yourself defected from my Western Demon Forest, not to mention that you lost the dignity of my demon race, but you actually dare to say such big words to compel us!"
<br><br>"Thanks to us before we left, we even raised you as the successor of my Western Demon Forest."
<br><br>"Look away, look away!"
<br><br>"No, I didn't say big words, much less lie to you." Milk Leopard Li said seriously.
<br><br>"Humph!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The three demons remained disdainful and said in a deep voice: "Then tell me, how do they break the sky and create immortality?"
<br><br>The three demons questioningly forced their eyes towards Milk Leopard Li.
<br><br>The milk leopard Li also did not conceal.
<br><br>She told the story of how Bone Ben Wei single-handedly captured the Irrigation of Immortality and forcibly elevated the seven coyotes into immortals.
<br><br>Then he slowly told about Yi Feng's light-hearted fist that broke the sky as well.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"Milk Leopard Li, you are really compelled by them, actually this kind of lie has been made up by you." Rhinoceros Lin said in a cold voice.
<br><br>"That is, actually really portrayed the shape, made up as if you had seen it with your own eyes." The rhinoceros earth also sent out a voice.
<br><br>"The rhinoceros earth commander is right, I just saw it with my own eyes." Milk Leopard Li said seriously.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>But the response to Milk Leopard Li was just a cold snort.
<br><br>And a fist broke the sky.
<br><br>Create immortal with bare hands.
<br><br>Blind chicken bullshit it.
<br><br>So heavenly things, fools believe.
<br><br>In the dense forest.
<br><br>Black feather surrounded by a dozen people dressed in different costumes, they have men and women, different postures.
<br><br>But without exception, the body is emitting strong fluctuations.
<br><br>They were none other than the demon experts that Black Feather had brought from the Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>"Black Feather, are you lying to the Lord of the Continent?"
<br><br>"That's right, where are the dead spirits you mentioned here? Tell me quickly, did you trick the Soul Regent Blade and the Immortal Pill from the Lord of the Continent for another purpose?"
<br><br>"What kind of tricks are you playing?"
<br><br>"If you dare to play tricks, the Lord of the Continent will not spare you."
<br><br>All at once, the crowd sent accusing voices towards Black Feather.
<br><br>Inherently, they are not a fan of black feather, because in terms of strength and skills, many of them are stronger than black feather.
<br><br>But black feather by virtue of oily mouth, mixed better than anyone.
<br><br>And this time even more let black feather led these people, so they are more unconvinced.
<br><br>However, in the face of their questioning, black feather is not afraid in the slightest.
<br><br>"What are you shouting, just stay here honestly, don't push the scum with me."
<br><br>Black Feather shouted extremely arrogantly, "Also, don't mention that old bastard Su Xuanjun in front of Laozi, here Laozi doesn't believe in his evil!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You!"
<br><br>"You actually don't even put the continental lord in your eyes, are you looking for death?"
<br><br>Black Feather's words instantly made the crowd move with anger.
<br><br>One by one, they revealed their aura and were about to make a move towards Black Feather.
<br><br>However, Black Feather didn't even look at them, but looked in a direction with a smile and knelt down to the ground in advance.
<br><br>"Black Feather, welcome Lord Bones, Lord Dog, Lord Centipede, and Lord Bear."
<br><br>Not long after, Bone Ben Wei landed in front of him with Ao Qing and others.
<br><br>Seeing this, the immortal demon crowd collectively paled.
<br><br>"Indeed, you have really betrayed Lord Continent."
<br><br>"How dare you be so treacherous as to betray the Lord of the Continent, aren't you afraid of death?"
<br><br>However, Black Feather ignored them all and instead respectfully said towards Bone Ben Wei, "Jagged Big Brother, my subordinate has returned without disgracing his mission."
<br><br>"That's right."
<br><br>"These are some small pills, and a small immortal weapon, brought over as an extra tribute to a few of you, and that terrifying lord behind a few of you."
<br><br>Saying that, Black Feather fished out another crystal clear jade vase from his ring, and a black short knife that emitted a languid fluctuation.
<br><br>On top of the short knife, the fierce aura was overwhelming, sealing the souls of many powerful beings.
<br><br>It was the Soul Regent Blade.
<br><br>"Please laugh at it."
<br><br>Black Feather respectfully handed it out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This scene directly caused the immortal world demons to explode.
<br><br>"You actually tricked out the Soul Regent Blade and Immortal Pill of the Continent Lord and gave it to someone else."
<br><br>"You traitor."
<br><br>"You deserve to die, you deserve to be struck by five thunderbolts from heaven."
<br><br>"You will suffer an unimaginable punishment!"
<br><br>"The Lord of the Continent will never spare you, and will make you go to heaven without a way to enter the earth without a door."
<br><br>Angry voices spread across the sky.
<br><br>Black Feather, however, twisted his ears, disdaining it.
<br><br>Instead, with an emboldened posture, he continued towards Bone Ben Wei and said, "Lord Bone, these are the very demons that were brought here at Lord Bone's command, and they have been chattering away here, so please kill them all as soon as possible!"
<br><br>PS: the second day of the year to welcome the God of Wealth, blessing everyone New Year big hair ha ha ha ha, the God of Wealth live at home not go ha ha ha!
