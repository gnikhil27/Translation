However.
<br><br>When the results came out, Yi Feng was immediately dumbfounded.
<br><br>Large dozens of human-looking young talents, actually one to ordinary talent are not, the talent is all super garbage.
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately let out a breath, his face became black.
<br><br>I thought I would be able to complete a large part of the apprenticeship mission today, but who knows, a mission progress can not be completed.
<br><br>This group of old men and women, why is not so unreliable ah!
<br><br>"That's it for today, let's disperse!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, no longer having the heart to talk more.
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>"Yes, why can that fatty and we can't?"
<br><br>"Obviously our strength is not worse than his!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng's words immediately caused many young talents in the field to emit unwilling voices and ask out towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Luckily, the old man and woman behind them were quick-eyed and instantly dried these young talents to the ground with a slap.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>"You bunch of unenlightened things."
<br><br>"Are you able to argue with the decision of the gentleman?"
<br><br>"Get lost, hurry up and get lost."
<br><br>The old men and women hurriedly blasted these young talents away, before they turned towards Yi Feng with apologetic faces and said, "Please don't be ordinary with them, sir."
<br><br>"It's okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said indifferently, after all, he himself, like them, was a waste that could not cultivate, so the heart of that cultivation heart he could understand.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>"But sir, we still want to take the liberty to ask a question, why sir before said to accept a hundred disciples, but now ......"
<br><br>The crowd cautiously looked at Yi Feng and couldn't help but ask out.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Looked at the young people who have left, Yi Feng is not afraid to hit their self-confidence, so truthfully said towards these old men and women: "In fact, it is not that I do not want to accept, mainly because you bring these young people ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng shook his head and then said, "The talent is really too poor."
<br><br>"Too poorly endowed?"
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and said rather breathlessly, "And not just poor, but so poor that there is no lower limit, of the super trash kind."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The crowd was filled with bitterness.
<br><br>One should know that these young talents were actually counted as the future Immortal River Continent, the successors of the top battle power.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It was such a group of young talents that in the eyes of Mr., they were actually the kind that was so bad that there was no lower limit?
<br><br>What kind of genius should it be to enter the eyes of Mr. ah!
<br><br>"Sir, then you mean, that boy of mine?" And the only lucky one, old man Chi, looked at Yi Feng with wide eyes.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"He counts as an accident."
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at the fat man next to him, also quite speechless.
<br><br>Just this received in public received, and always can not be backtracked.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>Yi Feng took Chi Yi bucket to the only main hall of the Heaven and Earth Gate, the Heaven and Earth Hall, under the certification of several people in the Qing Huan phase, Chi Yi bucket kowtowed to the master.
<br><br>Looking at Chi Yi Bucket who was kneeling on the ground, Yi Feng was anxious.
<br><br>This received a disciple who can not complete the task, but also have to take responsibility for teaching disciples, really difficult ah.
<br><br>This is not for nothing to find a trouble for themselves?
<br><br>But people have to have a beginning and an end, Yi Feng then had to start a serious lull.
<br><br>"As we all know, everyone has a path, you can eat so well, I think you will be able to achieve something in the path of eating, this book is my recipe, you take it to understand it well."
<br><br>"When you have accomplished your enlightenment, come back to me."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Yi Feng took out a "Complete Book of Recipes" from the ring of space and threw it to Chi Yi Bucket.
<br><br>Chi Yi Bucket took the "Complete Book of Recipes", flipped it open, and those small eyes that were squeezed together suddenly shone with a dazzling light.
<br><br>"Thank you master, thank you master, I will definitely penetrate it properly, and will definitely not let master down."
<br><br>Chi a bucket knocked his head heavily on the ground, clutching the "Complete Book of Recipes" lovingly, emitting a voice full of excitement.
<br><br>"Go on!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and dismissed the fatty.
<br><br>After all, there was nothing he could do today.
<br><br>Can not teach people the real thing, can only rely on this approach to stabilize first.
<br><br>When he can cultivate in the future, then find a way to teach this fatty a move and a half.
<br><br>Just let Yi Feng did not expect is that this fatty is actually so good to fool, a "recipe book" actually will really send him off.
<br><br>Wind Ling North words: re-state the system talent detection, the system upgrade over, Xian below lazy detection, because not worthy, human immortal ground immortal start are super garbage, of course, this is only an unusual situation is not absolute, the follow-up will also have exceptions, such as a certain martial spirit, have the supreme bone or something, will be detected to ordinary or more advanced.
