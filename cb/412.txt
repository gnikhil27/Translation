"Why can they all enter and I can't?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Why can't you enter, don't you have a number in your heart?" The Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart thumped.
<br><br>Was it a direct glance that saw that he had no talent.
<br><br>He smiled bitterly, but still didn't want to give up and said with a clasped fist, "It's true that I don't have talent, but I have a heart to join your sect, so please make it easy."
<br><br>Yi Feng's attitude made the Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch a little surprised.
<br><br>Usually in this kind of situation, most people would force their words and refuse to admit the fact that they had no talent, but Yi Feng directly admitted it, this attitude was really precious.
<br><br>He sighed and said, "Sorry, my Cloud Dragon Valley does not accept people without talent, there has never been a precedent broken for this, so my Cloud Dragon Valley cannot accept you, however, you can ask other clans instead."
<br><br>After saying that, he looked at the three people next to him and said softly, "Although this son has no talent, but his heart attitude can be made, my Cloud Dragon Valley has an ancestral training that cannot be broken, you can instead make an exception once and give him a chance."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hurriedly looked at the other three patriarchs. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Sorry, the same goes for my Heng Tian Jian Zhai."
<br><br>Hengtian Jianzhai patriarch said expressionlessly.
<br><br>"Although my Taiyi Valley is not as glorious as it was in the past, it is not so bad that it has fallen to the point of accepting mortals." The Taiyi Valley Patriarch refused outright.
<br><br>"Naturally, I, Canghai Mountain, can't either. If we break this example for you today, what should we do if other people in the field also ask for the same?"
<br><br>The Canghai Mountain Patriarch waved his hand and said, "Today we will not pursue how you actually mixed in, hurry back!"
<br><br>And at the same time when the four patriarchs sent out their voices, the other pending candidates next to Yi Feng had all been taken away, leaving him alone.
<br><br>In the square next to him, there were still various voices pointing at Yi Feng from time to time.
<br><br>Attracting the attention of all the people, he couldn't help but let out a long sigh.
<br><br>Afterwards, only then fell into the crowd and disappeared ......
<br><br>Yi Feng's appearance could only be considered a minor hiccup for the four clans, and just as they were about to beat a path back to their homes, an urgent report suddenly came.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The Four Great Patriarchs couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Your four Patriarchs, the scouts have sent a message that the Punitive Organization has set its eyes on the Night Family, and I'm afraid that they will launch an operation against the Night Family today."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The Four Patriarchs couldn't help but be shocked.
<br><br>"What should we do?" The Taiyi Valley Patriarch asked.
<br><br>"Although the Night Family and my four sects have an average relationship, they have to be saved this time." Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch said.
<br><br>"Not bad, this suddenly appearing spiral organization, first exterminated the Fang and Yun families, and now they are eyeing the even more powerful Night Family, what about the future?" The Canghai Mountain Patriarch said gruffly.
<br><br>"Yes, the rabbit died and the bird died, maybe it will be our turn next time." Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch said, "There is bound to be some heavenly conspiracy hidden behind this!"
<br><br>"Since the four of us are united, then it is not too late, let's rush to the night family rescue as soon as possible!" Heng Tian Jian Zhai patriarch said.
<br><br>The crowd nodded solemnly and handed over the disciples to the people below, and the four of them swept out into the air and rushed towards the Night Family.
<br><br>"I hope we're not too late to go and the Night Family can hold out!"
<br><br>In the rush, the four could not help but sigh.
<br><br>But just halfway through the rush, they came across two figures in mid-air.
<br><br>"Night energy?"
<br><br>Seeing the appearance, the four people were taken aback and couldn't help but ask, "How did you get here?"
<br><br>"Who should I be, it turns out to be the four of you, but I would like to ask, why can't I be here?" Night Energy asked rhetorically.
<br><br>"Didn't the Parallel Organization have their eyes on your Night Family?" The Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch asked, "Where did you get the free time to appear here?"
<br><br>"That's right, the PASSION is fixated on our Night Family." Night Energy nodded and said, "But how did you know about it?"
<br><br>"Our scouts got the news, this is not the four of us were about to rush over to support your Night Family, but we didn't expect to run into you halfway." Taiyi Valley Patriarch said.
<br><br>"So that's how it is, it's thanks to the four of you."
<br><br>Hearing this, Night Energy said thankfully, "But the four of you can rest assured that the crisis of my Night Family has been lifted, and the spiral organization has also been destroyed."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The organization has been wiped out?"
<br><br>The four people were shocked at the words and said, "Killed by you Night Energy?"
<br><br>"I would like to."
<br><br>Night Energy gave them a blank look, then explained, "It was a supreme master who struck and wiped them out."
<br><br>"What supreme master, they were seven Martial Emperors!" The four people said in surprise.
<br><br>"What are seven Martial Emperors?"
<br><br>Night Energy snorted coldly, then cast a wink at Ye Yi and said, "Yi'er, tell them about the scene at that time, so that they can open their eyes."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Ye Yi nodded her head.
<br><br>Afterwards, she organized her language and told the scene at that time when Yi Feng killed the seven members of the Parade Organization, and then told them one by one towards the four patriarchs.
<br><br>After listening to it, the four were amazed.
<br><br>"I can't imagine that there is such a high level person in this world."
<br><br>"Yes, to kill seven great Martial Emperor experts with the means of a mortal is simply unheard of!"
<br><br>"Such means, I'm afraid it's really an existence beyond the Human Immortal level."
<br><br>"This kind of senior, if you can meet and deal with them once, it is not a waste of this life!"
<br><br>The four people revealed a yearning look, and then looked at Night Energy.
<br><br>"Night can, can you know where that senior is, can you take us to pay a visit."
<br><br>"According to my daughter's guess, the senior should be inside the official pond city." Neng Neng said.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Official Pond City?"
<br><br>The four people were shocked, they never thought that the senior was in the official pond city where they were just now.
<br><br>"Go go go Night Energy, let's leave immediately and pay respect to the senior."
<br><br>The four were already impatient and more anxious than Night Energy.
<br><br>Night Energy nodded, then took Ye Yi, and with the four of them, they increased their speed and rushed towards Guan Tang City.
