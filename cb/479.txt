Su Yunyun, on the other hand, was quietly standing beside Yi Feng, helping him serve tea and pour water.
<br><br>On the one hand, her state of mind was also being influenced by Yi Feng, rapidly improving.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>Zhong Qing ran in.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng put down the jade slip and looked at him.
<br><br>"Greetings, Eldest Brother."
<br><br>And Su Yun Yun also hurriedly bowed her head in greeting.
<br><br>"Greetings Master, good day Fifth Senior Sister."
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded towards the two, and then said, "Master, just now there was a foolish crane outside, dragging a lot, not to mention injuring the old man Zhang who supported the boat, but also named to kill the fifth senior sister, so I cut him to death with a knife."
<br><br>"What, to kill your sister?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's gaze moved slightly and said, "Drag his body in to see." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And hearing that people were coming for her, Su Yunyun also suddenly got nervous and guessed in her heart who it could be.
<br><br>Soon after.
<br><br>Zhong Qing dragged in a corpse from outside and threw it on the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun's eyes snapped wide open.
<br><br>Because ......
<br><br>Because this silly gibberish that her Eldest Brother was talking about was no other than her deadly enemy, Chen Yi Zhen.
<br><br>And this is not Chen Yi Zhen's doppelganger, but the real body of the real thing.
<br><br>But at this moment, he is lying on the ground like a dead dog, and with the wound, it seems that he should be killed by a knife.
<br><br>Su Yunyun couldn't help but look at Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Originally.
<br><br>She has not been able to see what this elder brother has the ability, usually honest and simple iron naive, but who would have thought, a knife to Chen Yi Zhen dry over?
<br><br>But thinking back, it is.
<br><br>Just the old man and woman on the street outside, have a strong strength, not to mention her big brother?
<br><br>Master's disciples inside, can there be mortals!
<br><br>"Disciple don't be afraid, a trash only, your big brother has already helped you cut down." And when Yi Feng saw Su Yun Yun Yun's appearance, he couldn't help but speak out in comfort.
<br><br>Girl well.
<br><br>Seeing this kind of dead body, it is inevitable to be a little shocked.
<br><br>As for himself.
<br><br>It is true that he did not put this dead body in his eyes.
<br><br>This is after all the Xuan-fantasy world, so many years after crossing over, and have seen a lot of things to fight and kill, a dead person is indeed no big deal.
<br><br>Moreover, even Zhong Qing can be a knife over the people, is not a trash is what, completely not afraid to have any worries and trouble.
<br><br>"Zhong Qing ah, this trash dare to come to cause trouble, and want to move your fifth sister, drag him to the lake to feed the fish!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand towards Zhong Qing and instructed.
<br><br>"Yes, Master, I'll drag this trash away."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>Zhong Qing then dragged the corpse away.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Hearing Master and Eldest Brother say one word of trash, Su Yunyun's face was wonderful to the extreme.
<br><br>At least.
<br><br>Chen Yi Zhen was also an Immortal Emperor.
<br><br>One must know that if this matter were to spread in the outside world, it might cause what kind of turmoil.
<br><br>But her senior and eldest brother, but no such thing at all?
<br><br>Even the body of the titular Immortal Emperor, dragged to the lake to feed the fish?
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng continue to sit on the recliner to read the jade, not the least bit serious appearance, Su Yun Yun Yun heart for Yi Feng's admiration, has long been climbing to the top.
<br><br>What is a real high person?
<br><br>I'm afraid that only a man like her master who doesn't let him frown at anything in the world is worthy of being called a nobleman.
<br><br>Even the death of the immortal emperor, still can not let the master's state of mind fluctuate half, really do not know, the master has actually reached what realm.
<br><br>Thinking back.
<br><br>The things that she pursued in her previous life, what is it.
<br><br>I'm afraid they are not in the eyes of the master!
<br><br>After all, she was proud of her identity existence in her previous life, even if she died, in the eyes of the master only want to be as simple as a dead chicken ......
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Such being protected and protected, and someone to back up the feeling is really good it.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun extremely enjoy this feeling.
<br><br>This feeling, she has never enjoyed, after all, in her previous life as a female emperor, she was never the one to back up others.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>She turned her gaze towards the Book Collection Pavilion, with a vague flicker of surprise.
<br><br>In the Book Collection Pavilion.
<br><br>Including Chiyi Bucket, they were all flipping through the books in their hands as if their heads were lowered into the devil.
<br><br>"This one-punch bull is just too good-looking."
<br><br>"Because of it, I'm bald, I'm bald hahaha ......"
<br><br>A bald man in a cloak stood up and clenched his fist tightly, his eyes shining with a brilliant light.
<br><br>"Able to use a fist to solve things, after I still use what sword ah!"
<br><br>After saying that, he put his own native treasure sword, and damaged it on the spot.
<br><br>And on the beach by the lake, a man was lying on the ground, breeding a hen and a rooster.
<br><br>He took the eggs laid by the hen and began to hatch them according to the tips on top of "On How to Breed Poultry" in his hand ......
<br><br>Half a day later.
<br><br>A chick broke out of its shell.
<br><br>And in this chick's body, possessing a trace of seven-colored feathers, shining with a glittering light.
<br><br>Seeing this, the man laughed like crazy.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, the divine phoenix bloodline, actually really matched the divine phoenix bloodline, I, as the eighteenth generation heir of the imperial beast lineage, will definitely be able to shine the ancestors, no, surpass my predecessors."
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Meanwhile.
<br><br>Again at the edge of a cliff in the remote area of the Heaven and Earth Gate, a man with an eight-string beard held a copy of "A Billion Cold Jokes" in his hand.
<br><br>While studying it, while pulling and inserting the long sword in his hand.
<br><br>Just like that, the cycle was repeated.
<br><br>At this time, Wu Chang'an, who was practicing earth transport in the distance, burrowed out from inside the earth.
<br><br>But just out, a force came over him, and his body fell to his knees uncontrollably, while his hands merged upward, making an empty-handed white blade action.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an stared wide-eyed at the eight-letter beard that practiced drawing swords.
<br><br>He exclaimed in amazement.
<br><br>"Good man, even such an odd skill, 100 percent being practiced by the empty hand catching the white blade!?"
