A few days later.
<br><br>Yi Feng's sad face.
<br><br>"The dog system pitted me again!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed out, because the flyers had been sent out for several days, and still none of them came to worship.
<br><br>But the good thing is, the sects in East Victory are not like the North Sea, the disciples who can cultivate are much more than the North Sea.
<br><br>Every few years, the Alliance of Sects will organize a new initiation ceremony.
<br><br>The new ceremony is, frankly speaking, the recruitment of disciples.
<br><br>By the sect alliance unified in a place to open, to meet the cultivation requirements of the disciples will become to be selected.
<br><br>Then each major sect can select suitable disciples from among those to be selected to join their own sects.
<br><br>And Yi Feng was informed that his Heaven and Earth Sect also had a selection slot.
<br><br>This is a benefit given by the Sect Alliance. His Heaven and Earth Sect is at least a ninth grade sect certified by the Sect Alliance. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>At that moment.
<br><br>Yi Feng took Qing Huan phase and set off.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This white pick up disciples don't want for nothing ah.
<br><br>And this time into the new ceremony is opened in Nansha, Yi Feng on a flying sword, carrying Qing Huan phase grazing the ground towards Nansha.
<br><br>A few days later, the two came to the South Sand.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>In fact, Yi Feng's flying sword can still be much faster, but just out of the Ping River, the two people almost hit the trees, Yi Feng this is to reduce the speed.
<br><br>But even so, the wind blew all the way over, also messed with migraines are guilty.
<br><br>When the two arrived at the ceremony, the new ceremony is already nearing the end, those high ranking sects have taken those talented disciples away.
<br><br>The only ones left on the field were some of the eight or nine ranked sects.
<br><br>And the disciples who were not selected, most of them were only some crooked.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Even these eight or nine grade sects of the sect master, also looks deep breath, tiger.
<br><br>Yi Feng, according to the quota, stood with these eighth and ninth grade sect masters.
<br><br>He who straightened his back, but also has the aura of the master of a sect.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>His heart panicked a group.
<br><br>He is a waste mortal, to pretend to be a cultivator to enter and leave this occasion, is really difficult ah!
<br><br>You know, the people here are not an empty shell like him, but are all authentic experts.
<br><br>He even saw a terrifying martial spirit expert among them!
<br><br>"Old Qing ah, although I am very strong, but to keep a low profile, never cause trouble, you hear!"
<br><br>Yi Feng gently explained solemnly towards the Qing Huan phase next to him.
<br><br>"Yes, sir."
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang nodded respectfully.
<br><br>At these words, Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>And as the time passed, the disciples of the eighth-grade sects had already been selected, next, it was them, the ninth-grade sects, that were left.
<br><br>"That disciple, I'll take the Heavenly Moon Sect, you guys don't have a problem with that, right?"
<br><br>A middle-aged man took a step out and looked at one of the flashy-clad disciples.
<br><br>"Hmph, my Demon Heavenly Clan wants him too."
<br><br>Another old man stepped out and launched a scramble.
<br><br>"Hmph, are you sure you want to go against my Heavenly Moon Clan?" The man said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Is my Demon Heavenly Clan afraid of you?"
<br><br>The old man was tit-for-tat.
<br><br>"Then let's have a match."
<br><br>The middle-aged man slapped out his palm towards the old man, and immediately the two fought together.
<br><br>Although the disciples at the moment were all crooked ones left over from other sects' selections, they were still considered good seedlings for these ninth-grade sects.
<br><br>This battle, after all, was won by the Heavenly Moon Sect.
<br><br>And after these two sects, several other sects began to grab the disciples.
<br><br>As for Yi Feng.
<br><br>As for Yi Feng, he was standing there with no expression.
<br><br>Go ahead and grab it, grab it as hard as you can.
<br><br>Anyway, I am not involved, just leave one to me.
<br><br>After all, in case of provoking that clan, he heaven and earth door can not stand.
<br><br>But after two hours had passed, the disciples in the field had all been selected, not a single one left.
<br><br>Yi Feng had a black face.
<br><br>That fucking trip for nothing?
<br><br>How is this good?
<br><br>He couldn't help but look at an old man next to him.
<br><br>This old man was the master of the Nine Heavens Sect, and since it had been founded for a long time, it was there were several quotas, and thus several disciples had been selected.
<br><br>"Cough cough old man, I am the Heaven and Earth Sect Master, I came all the way over here and didn't get a single disciple, so can you discuss and let me have one?" Yi Feng said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>"Older brother, everyone is not easy, you are indeed quite pitiful, in that case, then I will let one to you!"
<br><br>The Nine Heavenly Clan old man smiled and immediately agreed readily.
<br><br>After all, to him, the few he received were all crooked, so letting one was no big deal.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>He picked out another worst woman from this group of crooked girls and gave it to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng turned his gaze to this female disciple.
<br><br>She was cold and beautiful, with stunning features.
<br><br>The body is even better, tall and ...... upright, there is a unique aura.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>In front of most cultivators, talent is everything, even if she looks beautiful, but no talent, it belongs to the existence that can be cut off at will.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly used the system to give her a test.
<br><br>Hi ah.
<br><br>The fucking ordinary qualification.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng happy.
<br><br>It is worthy of being selected by the sect alliance, even the worst qualifications are ordinary, those better disciples system are too lazy to test it.
<br><br>This is much more powerful than the group of old men and women in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Last night to now write two and a half, not satisfied and deleted two and a half, rub, really hard woo ......
