A few people just ready to go out, they saw the return of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Scared cold hair best!
<br><br>Just to slip.
<br><br>In the twinkling of an eye was caught by Yi Feng who appeared beside him.
<br><br>"Dog stuff! Still want to escape in front of me?" He grabbed Bone Ben Wei and threw him into the martial arts school.
<br><br>In order to show his sincerity, Bone Ben Wei stood up with a roll from the ground and was about to rush towards his small dark room.
<br><br>Unexpectedly, he was once again grabbed by Yi Feng.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was lifted by Yi Feng suspended in the air, so scared that the bones that had just been dismantled were shaking apart.
<br><br>The next moment, skeleton Ben Wei never thought of the gentle voice from the mouth of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Do not be afraid, how can I hurt you." He said, put Bone Ben Wei down gently.
<br><br>Also did not forget to pat the dust he just fell to the ground stained. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"You just have to do one thing for me, and I won't shut you down." He said gently.
<br><br>"Abba abba!" Bones Benway's eyeless eyes popped out in surprise.
<br><br>"Give me practice."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei was dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Poof!" Kneeled down with a bang!
<br><br>"You're not the number one expert." Yi Feng said comfortingly, "I'll just try."
<br><br>"Aba Aba ......" he shook his head frantically at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not care, raised his palm and struck towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>A palm slap over, skeleton Ben Wei was slapped to the wall directly scattered.
<br><br>No more movement.
<br><br>Next to the dog howling centipede crawling bear running.
<br><br>There is a ghost floating in mid-air directly stunned.
<br><br>"A bunch of waste." Yi Feng cursed, walked over and kicked the scattered bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>Still no movement.
<br><br>Just this???
<br><br>Yi Feng got angry.
<br><br>"Can't even take a single slap, and still the number one high ranking person?" He cursed angrily, "I pooh!"
<br><br>That's it?
<br><br>The first fucking master!
<br><br>What range of the first senior person ah.
<br><br>This broken martial arts school?
<br><br>The more Yi Feng thinks about it, the more he thinks yes.
<br><br>When he got the system to open the first issued is the martial arts school, and then is the self-proclaimed first master of the skeleton.
<br><br>This is not to say that the skeleton martial arts school of the first master?
<br><br>This pitiful broken system ...... but fortunately, one's own from this broken system white whoring martial emperor cultivation.
<br><br>This is the only thing that this system does.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the still scattered on the ground unmoving skeleton Ben Wei, grabbed a skeleton frame a brain thrown into the well!
<br><br>"I'll see how you can still run!" He said, a luck will be a large stone pressed on the well, "just you this waste still have the nerve to day still want to run out for sins!"
<br><br>Said, but also did not forget to rush in the side of the dog centipede and other curses, "really things to gather, follow the waste mixed you all also mixed into the waste of waste!"
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng went out again to find cultivators.
<br><br>But a little observation with cultivation, it was found that the whole city is weak and pathetic.
<br><br>Really time has changed ah.
<br><br>Yi Feng then understood that the people of this one city are all trash who can't cultivate.
<br><br>But think about it, even if you can find a cultivator, what can you do, this little Pingjiang City, there are cultivators are also trash.
<br><br>After all, you are the highest level of cultivator, Martial Emperor!
<br><br>The reality of not being able to cultivate suppressed for too long, this time suddenly become the world's invincible existence, not to say to people is simply the night of the brocade.
<br><br>Heaven forbid, heaven forbid!
<br><br>One day, Pingjiang City, it rained heavily, the alley where the martial arts school is located, few people, everyone closed the store, nestled in the old man Wang's house baked sweet potatoes natter to relieve boredom.
<br><br>At that moment, the courtyard door was pushed open and a man came out of the rain with an umbrella.
<br><br>Clear and proud and dusty, the world and independent.
<br><br>The whole a transcendent look.
<br><br>Several people looked dumbfounded.
<br><br>Only when the person entered the house, several people reacted.
<br><br>"Mr. ......" have risen, "Why are you here."
<br><br>"Sit sit sit sit." Yi Feng waved his hand and followed the crowd to sit by the fire.
<br><br>"I came today because there is a matter that has been pressed in my heart for a long time." Yi Feng said, with a distressed look on his face, "Want to talk to you guys about my troubles."
<br><br>"Sir you say, what is it?" Several people pricked up their ears, serious.
<br><br>"I am, in fact, not a mortal." He spoke with chagrin, "This matter has been weighing on my mind for a long time."
<br><br>The backs of several people suddenly straightened, their scalps trembled!
<br><br>Could it be!
<br><br>Could it be!
<br><br>The identity of the gentleman they have been curious about is about to be revealed?
<br><br>"I'm going to show my cards, in fact I'm not a mortal." Yi Feng put his hand on display, "I'm an absolute master!"
<br><br>"Uh ......" Several people looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Several people nodded, "And then what?"
<br><br>"There is no then ah." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Several people then picked up the still unbaked sweet potato and turned it over.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>"Sir is really good."
<br><br>That's it?
<br><br>That's the reaction?
<br><br>"You guys aren't surprised?" Yi Feng couldn't help but open his mouth and ask, repeating again for emphasis, "An expert, an absolute expert, an absolute ah!"
<br><br>"Surprised." Pork Rong hugged the sweet potato and nibbled, "Very surprised."
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>Yi Feng was speechless.
<br><br>He let out a long sigh, it seems that these people simply do not realize what this Jedi master means.
<br><br>It is also true that these mortals who only nibble on sweet potatoes, how can they know the troubles of cultivators.
<br><br>"Forget it, I shouldn't expect you guys to be surprised either." Yi Feng said and stood up, "How can you guys be surprised."
<br><br>"How uninteresting."
<br><br>Said, holding the umbrella and left.
<br><br>Several people nibbled on sweet potatoes and watched the sound of Yi Feng disappearing in the rain.
<br><br>"What's wrong with sir?" The shopkeeper couldn't help but speak, "Listen to the words of the gentleman must know that we won't be surprised, then he must know that we know his greatness, and how will he come to surprise us?"
<br><br>"I know!" Old man Wang slapped his thigh with remorse!
<br><br>"What's going on?" The next few people couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Have you forgotten, sir was previously experiencing life as a mortal in front of us all." He analyzed in a serious manner.
<br><br>"Even if Mister can know all the things in the world, he also knows that we know how powerful he is. But after all, he has been dealing with us as a mortal."
<br><br>"Now that he has confessed his greatness, he just wants a surprise congratulation among mortals." Said the old king's head to catch up, "We, however, did not understand the meaning of the gentleman, actually did not give him a little surprise reaction."
<br><br>Several people were enlightened, "I know, that's why Mr. left so disappointed! And said we should not expect a surprise reaction, because he knew that we already knew his power! Just wanted us to cooperate with him to have a mortal surprise!"
<br><br>"That's why sir said we were uninteresting!" The old king's head slapped his thigh, "That's sir's play, and sir's fun, too. And we are not cooperating!"
<br><br>"Aiya, I can't believe we didn't understand what sir meant! Really stupid as pigs!"
<br><br>"But now, hurry up, send someone to say hello to everyone next to you!" The old king's head hurriedly said one after another, "Tell them that if anyone is shown their identity by the gentleman, they must cooperate with the gentleman and pretend to be a million times surprised!"
<br><br>"Right, right!" The store boy next to him echoed, "Sir has already been disappointed once in our place, we can't let him down again!"
<br><br>"I'll go I'll go!" Porky Rong said, got up and ran into the rain.
<br><br>Looking at Porky Rong's disappearing back, the old king's head fell into contemplation again.
<br><br>"But why would Mister choose to confess his identity?"
<br><br>"Yes, before that, sir had been pretending to be a mortal."
<br><br>"Could it be that ......" the old king's head was abruptly horrified, "Could it be that mister is starting to get into the game?!"
<br><br>Several people heard the words like a thunderbolt fried brain!
<br><br>All of them around Mr., as soon as they opened more or less aware of, Mr. in laying a shocking chess game.
<br><br>Now Mr. suddenly abandoned his mortal identity, does not that mean, Mr. began to enter the game ......
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>After Yi Feng left the neighbor's house of baked sweet potatoes, and several people he knew had a showdown about his greatness.
<br><br>There was not even one surprised.
<br><br>Because of obtaining the martial emperor cultivation and exultation, he is like being poured with a pot of cold water after a pot.
<br><br>More and more feel the tastelessness of these mortals.
<br><br>But he still wasn't ready to brood.
<br><br>Light mouth said they mortals do not know how powerful.
<br><br>Then let the action tell them!
<br><br>For a long time since then, Pingjiang City can always see a figure flying around in the sky.
<br><br>When Porky Wing chopped the pig's head, he could always see Yi Feng walking out of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Before he could say hello, he saw Yi Feng flattening himself and floating with his feet completely off the ground.
<br><br>Then he smiled evilly at him and disappeared.
<br><br>Or, it was the beautiful little dame of the Red House walking in the alley, suddenly a flower pot falling from the sky, before she could make a reaction, her body was wrapped around a fly and disappeared in place.
<br><br>When he came back to his senses, only to see a young man to a shake his forehead of broken hair.
<br><br>"Do not ask who I am." Words, back hands fluttering and fly away.
<br><br>Or, it is the riverside laundry dame, see a figure on the other side of the river to the river like crazy swinging fists, the river water will be high in the sky.
<br><br>The curtain of water fell, only to see the opposite side of the man blew his fist at the other side of the river itself, an evil smile, dashing away ......
