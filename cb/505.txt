A time.
<br><br>Burial one anxiously jumped to his feet.
<br><br>Again, he smacked himself two mouths wildly, secretly hating himself for doing something brain-dead.
<br><br>"Second brother third brother, big brother must ask you guys to do me a favor, help me together to think of a way to get that sealed flyer out." Burial one black face towards burial two burial three to ask for help.
<br><br>But which knows, burial two burial three turn their heads to slip away.
<br><br>"Old two and three of you, you just abandoned your brother like this?" Burial one shouted with a stern face.
<br><br>"Aiya big brother, you say this is where the words, we several brothers who with who, just I think ah, usually is always big brother you protect us brothers, now how must also be the turn of the younger brother to protect you." The second burial said: "So brother is not thinking of joining the Heaven and Earth Sect as soon as possible, so as to improve the strength to protect you."
<br><br>"That's right, second brother is right."
<br><br>Burial three also hurried to pick up the cadence: "So I and second brother first go to rendezvous with the fourth old five, big brother you take your time here to find flyers, can not find no need to rush, we four brothers will protect you."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Burial two burial three without saying anything, blinked and flew up into the sky, disappeared. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The corners of the mouth of Burial One left behind twitched.
<br><br>A good plastic brotherhood.
<br><br>But looked back at the land of lava, rolling heat waves came to the face, and immediately cried.
<br><br>Damn.
<br><br>This is what kind of sins are suffered ah.
<br><br>When I think back on the action of throwing away the flyers, it was really too rash.
<br><br>It's like lifting a stone to smash your own feet.
<br><br>But remembering the burial four full of immortal weapons, and remembering the burial five Xuan Xian's super strength, burial one can not care so much.
<br><br>Eyes closed, legs clamped, head into the lava.
<br><br>"Ow."
<br><br>"It's hot for old me."
<br><br>Just into the lava, there came a mournful scream of burial one, in the lava a fierce a tear, the chicken are scalding red.
<br><br>Time has passed many days.
<br><br>Buried a still carp in the lava, the heart only that leaflet.
<br><br>As for what immortal river chaos monument, now long forgotten by him to the clouds.
<br><br>In the chaos.
<br><br>Extinction once again opened his eyes.
<br><br>Because the time since the last time he woke up, it just happened to be another month had passed.
<br><br>He could not help but raise the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>Last month there was not one more person in the hall, now two months have accumulated, there can always be more than ten or twenty people.
<br><br>If you're lucky, you might even get a few dozen more.
<br><br>"I just don't know how many people have been added to the most crucial red and blue immortal pillars."
<br><br>"What an expectation!"
<br><br>He got up and opened his eyes, his sharp gaze sweeping towards the hall.
<br><br>The first thing he locked on was the red immortal pillar.
<br><br>This does not see nothing, a look at the great, the whole person almost did not jerk over.
<br><br>The original red immortal pillar has seven people, two months have passed, there is not one more person is just, but only the two remaining white floating and Yun Yaoyao, black non-five people have long disappeared.
<br><br>"What's going on, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Extinction almost roared.
<br><br>"Lord, don't be anxious, it may be that the five Blackfeet have personal matters to deal with, you see they remain in the immortal pillar of the intentional doppelganger is not still there?" The silver masked man knelt on the ground and said respectfully.
<br><br>The exterminator inclined his head to take a look, his face only slightly recovered nodded.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>Black Africa five people left the idea of the doppelganger is still there, the probability is to go out to do things.
<br><br>After all, the idea body will also consume part of the cultivator's mind and cultivation, if it really left, the idea body can not remain here, in vain to consume the mind.
<br><br>But even if the five black fei did not leave, the extermination of the heart is still very difficult.
<br><br>Because two months of time, still did not allow the red immortal pillar to increase one person.
<br><br>The mood calmed down for a long time ......
<br><br>Only then did he turn his gaze to the blue light pillar.
<br><br>Although the pieces of the blue light pillar were not as good as the red light pillar, they were still one of the important pieces.
<br><br>Since the red immortal pillar did not increase one person, I think the blue immortal pillar should not be so, right?
<br><br>But this look.
<br><br>The corners of his mouth twitched straight, almost directly committed a heart attack.
<br><br>The blue immortal pillar is also the same, not only did not increase one person, but also missing one person.
<br><br>And the person missing is not like the black non-five, there are still intentional doppelgangers, the person in front of you is not even hair left.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on."
<br><br>Exterminate a hiss, a big hand, the sky astrology four up, began to deduce.
<br><br>The silver-masked man was kneeling on the side and did not dare to move, apprehensively waiting for the extinction of the world's deduction.
<br><br>Finally, when the deduction came to an end, the extinction mouth out of the incredible voice, "dead, actually dead?"
<br><br>The silver masked man kneeling on the side, hearing this news also changed his face.
<br><br>The people of the Heaven's Determination.
<br><br>One actually died.
<br><br>This is a great thing in the sky!
<br><br>One must know that the Exterminator had calculated through the astrolabe that at this moment, today in October, the Immortal River Continent would see a heyday of strong people.
<br><br>The accumulation of several epochs would allow the number of strong people to reach two hundred and thirty-four.
<br><br>This is the art of heaven's determination.
<br><br>No matter the accident, karma, many reasons, there will be no variation in the two hundred and forty-three.
<br><br>Because this was supposed to be the result in ten months.
<br><br>This is also the reason why the World of Destruction set up this big game and set the Immortal River Chaos Tablet to open in ten months.
<br><br>Therefore, if someone falls after ten months, this belongs to the normal category, after all, the number of two hundred and thirty-four is already the top.
<br><br>But now the Immortal River Chaos Monument has not even been opened yet, and one of the 234 people already confirmed as one of the two hundred and thirty-four has died.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on."
<br><br>The palms of his hands were shivering.
<br><br>The death of one person meant that the number of two hundred and thirty-four could not be made up at all.
<br><br>Then, his big game could not be activated.
<br><br>However, he did not completely panic, for the time being, there was only one less blue immortal pillar person, as long as it was not a red immortal pillar person, there might be a little remedy with a little effort.
<br><br>But however, more devastating things came one after another.
<br><br>The five black African people just still existed in the idea of the doppelganger, a swish.
<br><br>It directly disappeared.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It made the eyes of the masked man kneeling on the ground stare straight up.
<br><br>And the exterminator could not help but spit out a mouthful of old blood.
<br><br>Got.
<br><br>Even the last comfort was gone.
<br><br>"Damn damn damn, what kind of change has occurred."
<br><br>"Astrology, rise again."
<br><br>"Check for me!"
<br><br>Perdition was gloomy, and a heavy voice came out.
<br><br>At once, the sky astrological signs rose again.
<br><br>Also want to find out the cause of this person's death, find out where the five black non-friends have gone, and more importantly, find out where exactly there was a change of heart.
