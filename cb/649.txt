Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>Lu Zun had an angry face.
<br><br>Only now did he realize what it meant to have a cold heart.
<br><br>Still because of the matter of Lu Chong being imprisoned in the Dark Shadow Island, the senior management of the Great Harmony Sect not only expelled Lu Chong from the Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>Now he, Lu Zun.
<br><br>In the Great Harmony Sect also fell, even the disciples began to look at him with colored glasses.
<br><br>Now even after hollowing out his authority as an elder, he was directly removed from his position as an elder.
<br><br>In the hall.
<br><br>Hearing the clan's decision just now, Lu Zun clenched his fist tightly.
<br><br>"Wait on, wait on two months."
<br><br>"When my son's training is three months full, I want you to be impressed." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Report!"
<br><br>"Sovereign, the continental lord's house has sent someone!"
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>A disciple came to report.
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>Patriarch Fang Scarf's eyes were raised and he stood up in a hurry.
<br><br>"Quickly please."
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>The man who had been sent by Li Hongtian walked into the hall.
<br><br>"We have met the messenger."
<br><br>The people saluted one after another.
<br><br>Although the man did not know why Li Hongtian was suddenly so polite to the Great Harmony Sect, but remembering his explanation, he did not dare not take it to heart.
<br><br>He hurriedly helped the crowd up.
<br><br>"Aiyaa, Sovereign Fang is polite, please get up, please get up."
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Fang Scarf and the others looked puzzled.
<br><br>When did.
<br><br>The people of the West Ning Immortal Continent were so polite?
<br><br>For the subordinate sects, which of the messengers sent were not nostrils up to the sky.
<br><br>He especially remembered that a few days ago, because of Lu Chong's matter, the West Ning Immortal Continent was furious and suppressed his Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>"Messenger, dare to ask you to come this time?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf asked apprehensively.
<br><br>"This time, I am here to bring you a great news." The man said with a smile, "The continental lord specially asked me to invite you to come to the residence of the West Ning Immortal Continent to discuss the matter of cooperation in mining mineral crystals within the West Ning Immortal Continent."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this news, Fang Scarf and the others stared in awe.
<br><br>It was actually a matter of crystal mining cooperation?
<br><br>To know.
<br><br>Who can cooperate with the continental lord's office on crystal mining matters, is equivalent to being one with the continental lord's office, considered the spokesman of this continent.
<br><br>But for this inexplicable good news, Fang Scarf still felt some apprehension, busy asking: "Dare to ask the messenger, why all of a sudden?"
<br><br>"Uh, the continent lord didn't say much about this, I think it must be because your clan's recent actions, as well as its performance in all aspects, have made the continent lord very satisfied!" The man smiled and said, "Well, I will not say much more, first go back to resume orders, your clan's people please come as soon as possible, please do not make the continental lord wait!"
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>The man had left.
<br><br>And Fang Scarf and the others were still speculating on what the man said.
<br><br>"Our performance and actions have satisfied the Continent Lord?" One of the elders murmured, then his eyes lit up and said, "I know."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf turned his inquiring gaze to look.
<br><br>"Sovereign, I'm afraid it's because of Lu Chong's matter!"
<br><br>That elder said with a smile, "Lu Chong burned down the branch of the Heaven's Immortal Hall, causing the Heaven's Immortal Hall to become furious, and the West Ning Immortal Continent almost suffered from the implication."
<br><br>"But we handled this matter properly!"
<br><br>"First, we compensated the Heaven's Immortal Hall's losses, you personally apologized, Patriarch, and expelled Lu Chong from the division, so I guess it was our attitude plus quick response that made the continent lord look at us and made him rush to satisfaction, which gave us this great opportunity!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Fang Scarf and the others' eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"I'm afraid it's as you said, eight or nine."
<br><br>Inevitably, Fang Scarf, whose face was full of joy, turned his gaze to Lu Zun, whose face was gloomy at the side.
<br><br>"Lu Zun, as you can see, if your son was not expelled from the clan, where would my clan get such a blessing today?" Fang Scarf said, "If not, not to mention this kind of blessing, I'm afraid my clan would still be suppressed to what extent."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Lu Zun clenched his fist tightly, lowered his head and said half a word.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Fang Scarf saw this, came over and patted Lu Zun's shoulder, "It can't be helped, it's all for the sake of the sect, so next, have to continue to condescend to you."
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Lu Zun lifted his head.
<br><br>"Since the continental lord can look up to us and give all the crystal mines to my Great Harmony Sect to be in charge, then we should do better." Fang Scarf raised his head and said, "So next, please leave the Great Harmony Sect as well!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Lu Zun's eyes instantly turned red.
<br><br>"I Lu Zun since childhood in the Great Harmonization Sect, for the Great Harmonization Sect has made a great deal of achievements, son died a not to mention, I for the clan with serious injuries eight times, light injuries countless, but also left a stubborn disease."
<br><br>"Even my heavy son's foundation problems, but also because of the early years of the clan mission injuries caused."
<br><br>"It can be said that our family has given our lives to the Great Harmony Sect, but we did not expect to end up like this today."
<br><br>"I have nothing to say."
<br><br>Lu Zun removed the symbol of the Great Harmony Sect from his clothes and walked out of the hall in a despondent form.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Behind him, there was a crowd of ridicule, as well as joy for the invitation from the continental lord's house.
<br><br>As for the old man who had given countless hours for the Great Harmony Sect, not a single person cast a half-hearted look of pity.
<br><br>And after Fang Scarf and the others packed up a little.
<br><br>With Fang Scarf as the leader, with a group of elders, changed into formal new clothes, a group of people full of red face set off towards the West Ning Immortal Continent.
