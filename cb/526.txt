"Uh, what's wrong with this book, Uncle Bai?" Yuan Jing couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"I'm asking you, where exactly did this book come from?"
<br><br>White Leader Tian's voice turned hoarse at this moment, that urgent look, as if Yuan Jing was going to kill someone if she didn't tell him.
<br><br>"The book, the book is Brother Yi's!"
<br><br>Jing Yuan was obviously stunned and said hurriedly, "Big Brother Yi originally wanted to treat these books as trash for me to throw away, but I felt it was a strange pity to throw them away, so I just put them on this empty shelf."
<br><br>"Big Brother Yi?"
<br><br>"Who is Brother Yi, but the one who injured the starting drain?" White Leader Sky asked with an urgent voice.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Yuan Jing tightly bit her red lips and nodded her head stiffly.
<br><br>At these words, Bai Lingtian took a deep breath, and without saying a word turned his head and walked quickly towards Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yuan Jing's heart panicked and she hurriedly caught up. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Uncle Bai, listen to my explanation, things aren't like that."
<br><br>"It was Bai Qiqu who provoked first that day, and Duke Yi had no choice but to strike."
<br><br>"And he struck out because of me, if you want to blame me, it's really none of Duke Yi's business."
<br><br>While chasing after Bai Lingtian, Yuan Jing explained in an anxious tone.
<br><br>But the sullen Bai Lingtian ignored Yuan Jing, instead, he accelerated his steps and rushed towards the entrance of Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>Seeing this appearance of Bai Lingtian, Yuan Jing's face was bloodless.
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>Trouble is really big!
<br><br>At the door of Yi Feng's room, when Yuen Long Tian saw Bai Ling Tian rushing to the door, he also looked anxious and hurriedly greeted him and said, "Master Bai, don't be anxious, this kid is shrinking inside the room, no matter how much he shouts, he just won't come out, I will break the door and take that kid out and hand him over to you for disposal."
<br><br>With that, Yuen Long Tian's qi surged, an arrow step back to Yi Feng's door, a lingering immortal yuan palm, directly towards Yi Feng's room door.
<br><br>"Father don't."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yuan Jing shouted with a miserable white face.
<br><br>However, her shouting, where to stop Yuen Long Tian who was bent on performing in front of Bai Ling Tian?
<br><br>But what no one had expected was that in the nick of time, Bai Lingtian suddenly raised a slap and smacked Yuen Long Tian to the ground.
<br><br>The scene suddenly froze.
<br><br>Yuan Jing was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian was paralyzed on the ground, holding his face also full of confusion.
<br><br>"Bai, Family Master Bai, why is this, why did you hit me?"
<br><br>The aggrieved Yuen Long Tian couldn't help but ask out loud.
<br><br>But what the two people never expected was that the sullen Bai Leader Tian, without saying half a word, lightly stepped to Yi Feng's door and bent his body respectfully.
<br><br>"Yuancheng Bai Family, Bai Leader Tian, meet sir."
<br><br>"I don't know that sir is visiting Yuancheng, I am guilty!"
<br><br>As soon as his words fell.
<br><br>The Yuan family's father and daughter next to him, their eyes almost fell off in shock.
<br><br>For ......
<br><br>Why?
<br><br>Didn't you come over to ask for punishment?
<br><br>You injured your son, and you still have this respectful look?
<br><br>And say they are guilty?
<br><br>The shocking waves in the hearts of the two people no longer know what to use to describe.
<br><br>They had no idea what was going on.
<br><br>But Bai Lingtian still ignored the two people's shock, but continued to bow, standing at Yi Feng's door.
<br><br>Seeing this kind of posture of Bai Lingtian, spare the Yuan family father and daughter two people have countless questions in their hearts, at this moment, they also do not dare to make a sound.
<br><br>The surrounding space.
<br><br>A batch of quiet.
<br><br>Under the extreme silence, a sound finally came from within the room.
<br><br>"Hoo!"
<br><br>"Ha!"
<br><br>The three people moved their ears.
<br><br>It seemed to be Yi Feng's purr.
<br><br>White Leader Tian's expression immediately moved, "Since sir is resting, then I will not disturb for now."
<br><br>After saying that, White Leader Tian re-bowed and hurriedly exited the room door with light steps.
<br><br>And the puzzled Yuan family father and daughter also hurriedly followed.
<br><br>Retreating back to the inner hall, the Yuen Long genius finally couldn't help but ask out once more.
<br><br>"Family Master Bai, what the hell, exactly?"
<br><br>Yuan Jing also cast her gaze over.
<br><br>Seeing the two's puzzled appearance, the White Leader genius took a deep breath and asked quietly, "Do you still remember, what Lord Wu Tian once told us?"
<br><br>At these words, Yuen Long Tian's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Speaking of this person, a strong reverence had grown in his heart.
<br><br>He was the pride of the Heaven of the Wu Tian Empire, the absolute overlord.
<br><br>Now only in his twenties, he was already the ruler of the Wu Tian Empire, and even the strongest expert within the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>The entire empire was convinced of him.
<br><br>It was also thanks to White Leader Tian that he was qualified to meet.
<br><br>"At that time, Lord Wu Tian said that back then, when the barrier between the Lingxu Realm and the Immortal River Continent had not yet passed, the teenage him had arrived at the Immortal River Continent by mistake due to spatial turbulence."
<br><br>"He originally thought he would never return to his hometown, but inside a small city, he met a gentleman."
<br><br>"This gentleman taught him cultivation, relieved him of many confusions, and helped him break the barrier to cultivation, so that his cultivation was smooth sailing from then on."
<br><br>"It was because of this gentleman that he had the skill of tearing through space and reentered the Lingxu Realm by tearing through space when the two realms were not yet connected."
<br><br>"And all of his achievements today, becoming the first person in the empire and the king of the empire, are all because in addition to that gentleman's teachings to him, but also because when he was parting, that gentleman gave him a supreme divine skill."
<br><br>"But this is also Lord Wu Tian's regret, because at that time when he was young, he did not know where that small town was, so since that parting, he has never seen that gentleman again, much less personally thanked that gentleman a word."
<br><br>"So since that time, Lord Wu Tian has asked us to keep an eye out, and if we see someone similar to that gentleman, we must treat him respectfully and inform him at the first opportunity."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian said in a heartfelt manner.
<br><br>As he spoke, his eyes showed his admiration for Wu Tian, and he was also full of aspiration for that legendary gentleman.
<br><br>And Yuan Jing at the side was also listening in fascination.
<br><br>Never would have thought that the number one person in their empire actually had such a past, and was even more curious as to what kind of person that gentleman who nurtured such a person as the Wu Tian Guojun should be?
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"It seems that you remember the words of Lord Wu Tian very well." White Leader Tian nodded in satisfaction.
<br><br>"But Family Master Bai, what do these words that Lord Wu Tian had said have to do with this person in front of me?" Yuen Long Tian asked incomprehensibly.
