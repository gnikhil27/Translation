"Whew!"
<br><br>Outside the 100,000 Great Mountains, Ao Bi Fang and the others who were transported out by the scrolls were breathing heavily.
<br><br>One by one, they all had palpitations in their hearts, accompanied by an ugly look.
<br><br>Who would have thought that Ao Qing, who was once looked down upon by them, would actually force Ao Bi Fang to take out the teleportation scrolls that he had treasured for thousands of years.
<br><br>This kind of treasure, in Ao Bi Fang's view, is a life ah.
<br><br>Ao Qing actually used it on Ao Qing.
<br><br>Moreover, when they came, there were more than twenty people, but by now there were only a few demon clans left, and there was not even a single demon emperor left.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The moment he thought of this, he couldn't help but burst out in full rage, and the countless rocks around him burst under this roar.
<br><br>But right now, they were only able to rush back towards the tribe with their heads in the dust.
<br><br>After passing through the transmission array, they soon had returned to the Red Sun lineage. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Some of the people stationed in the Red Sun Lineage and some of the descendants heard the commotion and even hurriedly welcomed them over.
<br><br>However, when they saw Ao Bi Fang and others, the faces of all of them changed.
<br><br>What, only a few people left?
<br><br>And each one is still so wretched!
<br><br>But even seeing this scene, the crowd still did not think in a bad way, after all, they went to the lineup is clear, especially Ao Bi Fang personally, there can not be any accidents.
<br><br>As for the wretched and less people, I'm afraid it's back in batches, but that said, the enemy should really not be weak either.
<br><br>Therefore, the crowd still warm smiles to welcome them.
<br><br>"Greetings to Lord Bi Fang, Lord Bi Fang is out, I think he took down that martial school!" A descendant Demon King hastily said in a flattering manner.
<br><br>"Yes, yes!"
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang is really powerful."
<br><br>Seeing this, the other descendants also hurriedly slipped up and patted their horses.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang was poked to the pain point, his face slightly changed, but did not pay attention to them.
<br><br>But this demon king obviously did not react, and continued to say flatteringly: "Since that martial arts school was taken down, I think Ao Qing must have been captured back by Lord Bi Fang?"
<br><br>"Where are you talking so much?"
<br><br>Being poked again, Ao Bi Fang finally couldn't bear it anymore, and slapped over, that slippery demon king was instantly slapped on the ground by him, dead as can be.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd was in a state of shock.
<br><br>Looking at the gloomy faces of Ao Bi Fang and others, a bad feeling emerged in the hearts of the crowd.
<br><br>I'm afraid that something is really wrong.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang ignored them and settled down on the head seat, gloomy face, did not speak for a long time.
<br><br>The hall, into a silence.
<br><br>At this moment, not a single person dared to speak.
<br><br>"Someone, bring out the Zun-breaking Pill for me!"
<br><br>Finally, the more he thought about it, the more reluctant Ao Bi Fang passed out a commanding voice.
<br><br>"You want this?"
<br><br>The crowd looked at him with shocked gazes.
<br><br>"Good, can't wait any longer." Ao Bi Fang said in a hoarse voice: "Ao Qing has been out of our control, Qingcheng ...... Qingcheng this hope has also been dashed, only I can do it myself."
<br><br>"I took the Broken Dignity Pill although I can not become a true demon dignity, but enough to make me a half dignity, half dignity realm, enough to defeat the Devouring Heavenly Emperor."
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, the crowd in the arena was in shock.
<br><br>"Bi Fang Demon Clan, you should know that there is only one Dignity Breaking Pill for our Red Sun Tribe, if you take it, there will be none left, and even if a talented descendant pops up in the future, you won't be able to make him break the Dignity."
<br><br>At this time, several other demon clans came out with worried voices.
<br><br>You have to know that the Demon Clan and Demon Dignity is an absolute big hurdle, and I don't know how many talented clansmen have been stuck.
<br><br>For example, the Heaven Devouring Emperor, Ao Bi Fang were both Demon Sect Grand Perfection, but they could never break through that step.
<br><br>Of course, because of the talent, even if they take the broken Zun Dan, they can only break a half Zun at most.
<br><br>Originally, this Dignity Breaking Pill was reserved for Ao Qingcheng, but with Ao Qingcheng intact, it was no longer worth what they were giving.
<br><br>"I thought it over!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang gritted his teeth and said, "This is what they forced us to do, if Ao Qing returns, we will have no more chance, and as long as we take down the Heaven Devouring Emperor, we have plenty of ways to deal with Ao Qing!"
<br><br>The crowd weighed the pros and cons and finally nodded their heads.
<br><br>After getting the Dignity-Breaking Pill, Ao Bi Fang then went into seclusion, and under the Dignity-Breaking Pill, he successfully entered the Half Dignity realm.
<br><br>And the first thing he did when he came out of seclusion was to launch a civil war.
<br><br>In less than half a month, the vast territory of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf was divided into two pieces.
<br><br>Also today, Ao Bi Fang and Heaven Devouring Emperor finally broke out in a battle.
<br><br>And because Ao Bi Fang is a half-exalted realm, even though the Devouring Heaven Emperor has considerable resources because of the royal family lineage, but still lost, took a slap from Ao Bi Fang and fled in haste.
<br><br>Night.
<br><br>The pale Sky Devouring Demon Emperor and a dying old man sat together.
<br><br>"Elder Jin, now the clan has broken out in a civil war, and that Ao Bi Fang has broken through the half-exalted realm, if we delay, we will definitely be won over by that Red Sun lineage!"
<br><br>The Devouring Heaven Emperor looked at the old man with an ugly face and asked in a soft voice: "Although you have been in seclusion for hundreds of years, your divination has been rumored even among the previous generation, so today I asked you to come out of seclusion because I want your help to tell a trigram."
<br><br>"Nowadays, how can the danger of the royal family be solved?"
<br><br>"Alas!"
<br><br>The old man sighed softly, a few runes rose in his hand, and as slight fluctuations flooded his body, he slowly closed his eyes.
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor waited nervously on the sidelines.
<br><br>A full three hours later, the old man opened his eyes, and the already dying man was shrouded in a layer of death.
<br><br>"Elder Jin has worked hard."
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor hurriedly spoke out, and then turned his expectant gaze toward him.
<br><br>"There is only one person to save your royal lineage today!" The old man said tiredly.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>The Devouring Heaven Emperor's eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Your son."
<br><br>The old man said.
<br><br>"My son?"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor was incredulous, none of his three sons seemed to be able to hold up this kind of thing ah.
<br><br>If the best ......
<br><br>"My eldest son?"
<br><br>The old man shook his head.
<br><br>"That's my second son?"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor frowned, since it was not the eldest son, it must be the second son, after all, besides the eldest son, the best is the second son.
<br><br>However, the old man shook his head again.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor trembled, stood up, stared and asked, "Ao Qing?"
