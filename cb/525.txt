The courtyard door of Yuan Jing's residence was pushed open.
<br><br>The three uninvited guests, Yuen Long Tian, White Leader Tian, and Shadow, barged in directly.
<br><br>The atmosphere inside the house was instantly heavy.
<br><br>Seemingly sensing that the visitors were not good, three shadows descended from the sky.
<br><br>A bear.
<br><br>A dog.
<br><br>A black robe.
<br><br>As for the small centipede lying on the dog's head, it was completely ignored by the three.
<br><br>After the three shadows landed, the black robe in the lead glanced at the three and sat down directly on the main seat in the hall.
<br><br>Crossed his legs.
<br><br>The dog and the milk dose, on the other hand, stood behind the black robe left and right. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Seeing the three in this manner, the leader of the white collar days eyes narrowed.
<br><br>"This black robe is the one who injured the starting drain?" White Leader Tian asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"White Family Master, it wasn't him." Yuen Long Tian echoed in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Then where did he run out from?" White Leader Sky asked with a frown.
<br><br>"It is said that this black-robed man is that person's subordinate, and that black bear and dog are also that person's pets." Yuen Long Tian whispered, "According to the reliable information scouted before, this three does not have much strength."
<br><br>"Subordinates?"
<br><br>White Collar Sky frowned slightly.
<br><br>The eyes directly moved away from the three Bone Ben Wei's bodies.
<br><br>Since they were subordinates, it wasn't worth making him make a big deal out of it, much less making him invest more energy.
<br><br>Then directly instructed: "Shadow, here is left to you."
<br><br>After saying that, he directly skipped over the few skeletons Ben Wei and led Yuen Long Tian towards the inner courtyard behind the hall.
<br><br>After the two of them left, Shadow moved his palm and a stool moved directly behind him.
<br><br>He sat down directly.
<br><br>He went toe-to-toe with Skeletal Benevolence.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>Another buzzing sound came out, and a long sword was directly inserted between him and Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Seeing this stance, do you think you have some strength?" The shadow looked at Bone Ben Wei and emitted a meaningful voice.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei didn't pay any attention to him.
<br><br>"Heh!"
<br><br>The shadow coldly laughed, pulled out a white cloth from his pocket, and leaned down to gently wipe the longsword's body.
<br><br>"In fact, just now you are considered to be aware of the time, when the lord was here, you did not talk too much to delay him."
<br><br>The shadow passed out a voice to itself.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>Then, his words turned again.
<br><br>"Although my lord did not put you in his eyes, and you did not talk too much, but just by your posture alone, you have already made my lord unhappy."
<br><br>"So even if the lord did not explicitly give orders, but as a person who has followed him for hundreds of years, I still feel the need to give you a little lesson to see ......"
<br><br>Through the inner courtyard, at this time the white collar days and Yuen Long days have come to the inner hall.
<br><br>With a sweep of his thoughts, Bai Ling Tian found two different rooms with different two people living in them.
<br><br>It was none other than Yuan Jing and Yi Feng who was hooting and hollering.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>For their arrival, these two did not know about it now.
<br><br>"My lord."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian slightly bowed his head and waited for orders.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>White Leader Tian nodded, glanced at Yuan Jing's room, and said indifferently, "Go bring that person here, and I will go talk to Jing'er about the matter of the marriage contract."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>A shady look flashed in Yuen Long Tian's eyes, and then he went straight to Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>After Yuen Long Tian left, White Leader Tian was silent in place for a while.
<br><br>In his mind, he prepared his words.
<br><br>His eldest son, Bai Yanchun, was super talented and could foresee a future where he could lead the Bai family to greater glory.
<br><br>For this purpose.
<br><br>He, Bai Lingtian, could give everything for it.
<br><br>Even if he, as the head of the Bai family, stooped to his status to personally come to a junior to talk about the marriage.
<br><br>The heart says the words are already set.
<br><br>Even in order to be able to get Yuan Jing to agree, he was ready to make some concessions.
<br><br>But just when he wanted to move, he suddenly found several books on the bookshelf beside the hall.
<br><br>The book at the top, the three words of Taijiquan reflected in his eyes and deeply attracted his eyes.
<br><br>He crossed over with an arrow step.
<br><br>Close up will be tight pupils, dead eyes on that book "Taijiquan".
<br><br>He fiercely shivered.
<br><br>This book gang, it was actually exactly the same as the one he once had the pleasure of seeing.
<br><br>"No, it can't be true!?"
<br><br>The scene that had once shocked him came to White Collar Sky's mind, and his breathing sharpened in this moment.
<br><br>Trembling palms fell to the book help of "Taijiquan" and nervously flipped it open.
<br><br>Only a corner was revealed, and after peering into a small scene, it was like a thunderstorm resounded in White Leader Tian's mind, and at the same time, he couldn't help but retreat several steps.
<br><br>"Which gentleman is it?"
<br><br>"Or is it a certain expert who also received the blessing?"
<br><br>Just as he couldn't help but murmur, a person came up next to him.
<br><br>"Greetings, uncle Bai, I don't know that uncle Bai is here, so I apologize for the delay."
<br><br>The visitor was none other than Yuan Jing who had just stepped out of the room.
<br><br>Only at this moment, her face was slightly pale.
<br><br>Because Bai Lingtian's presence was not only flattering to her, but more of a real shock.
<br><br>Even his reason for coming here, Yuan Jing had a general idea in her mind.
<br><br>Either it was about her marriage contract with Bai Yanchun.
<br><br>Either it was about Yi Feng's injury to Bai Qiqu.
<br><br>Both were no more than that.
<br><br>But no matter which reason, for Yuan Jing, it is absolutely big trouble.
<br><br>But also know, run is not to run away.
<br><br>The only way is to face it.
<br><br>She tightly bites up her red lips, her heart has already made up her mind.
<br><br>The matter of marriage, dead not to agree.
<br><br>The matter of Yi Feng, she to resist.
<br><br>She slightly angled her head, gritted her teeth and waited for the rise of the white collar days.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What she did not expect was that Bai Lingtian grabbed her shoulders with both hands and asked in an urgent voice, "I ask you, this book, where did it come from?"
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>The question that caught her off guard caused Yuan Jing to freeze.
<br><br>She had even prepared a set of words to face Bai Lingtian's question, but who expected Bai Lingtian to ask this instead of following a routine?
