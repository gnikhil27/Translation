"What?"
<br><br>"Immortal Irrigation, it's really Immortal Irrigation!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, everyone present was stunned.
<br><br>When Skeleton Ben Wei said just now that he was going to make the seven coyotes become immortal on the ground, they thought it was an adult teasing a child and making a joke.
<br><br>After all, it seemed to them that this was simply impossible.
<br><br>You know, although the seven little wolves are gifted and born with the strength of demon kings, even so, they are still far from becoming immortal.
<br><br>But directly subverted them is the blink of an eye immortal irrigation will be enveloped and come.
<br><br>And under the envelope of immortal irrigation, the strength of the seven coyotes grew like mad under the eyes of everyone.
<br><br>Demon King.
<br><br>Demon Emperor.
<br><br>Demon Sect. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Demon Sovereign.
<br><br>Demon saint.
<br><br>Demon Emperor ......
<br><br>Then again, from the One Life Demon Emperor, directly to the Ten Life Demon Emperor.
<br><br>And after the ten-life demon emperor again received the irrigation of immortality, it was already completely become the human immortal realm.
<br><br>Such a scene.
<br><br>Let the crowd present collectively dumbfounded.
<br><br>For a time, the crowd was breathless, dumbfounded and staggered.
<br><br>This completely overturned their perceptions and refreshed their concepts.
<br><br>Like Ao Zhong and the others, they had worked hard for thousands of years to cultivate and were able to reach the realm of demon dwelling with the help of spicy strips.
<br><br>But the seven coyotes have not yet reached the full moon, and they have become immortal directly fucking.
<br><br>What kind of divine means is this!
<br><br>On the side, Milk Leopard Li also stared in the same way.
<br><br>The scene in front of her eyes, in addition to shocking not to mention, was like a heavy slap on her face.
<br><br>Especially when she remembered that she had previously said that she had brought the seven young wolves to the Western Demon Forest to be able to obtain good cultivation, she could not wait to find a crack in the ground.
<br><br>Their West Demon Forest's cultivation, in front of this one, I'm afraid it really is the younger brother of younger brothers.
<br><br>You know, her three Western Demon Forest leader, desperately cultivating, eat countless heavenly treasures, but only to reach this realm.
<br><br>And this one, in the blink of an eye created seven immortals!!!
<br><br>It is equivalent to you wasting thousands of years of time, but not as good as someone just came out of his mother's womb.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>The crowd was also surprised to find out at this moment that this black-robed person was the real big brother!
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"My Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan is going to rise today."
<br><br>Ao Zhong even opened his arms to the sky and roared, then he hugged Ao Qing's mother and shouted, "Madam, I'm really too excited, or this son you gave me is useful!"
<br><br>"I'm planning to go back later, we two must celebrate, and by the way, we will create another son with you who is as promising as Qing'er, adding another hope for the rise of our Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>After the excitement, Ao Zhong excitedly walked towards Bone Ben Wei again and said enthusiastically, "High man, you are really awesome."
<br><br>"Yes, yes!"
<br><br>"It's really better to be known than to see!"
<br><br>"The tall man is really great."
<br><br>"If only I could be like the tall man in this life, it would be great, it's so admirable."
<br><br>"Yes, that palm of the tall man just now explored the sky and pulled the Irrigation of Immortality hard, it is simply too imposing."
<br><br>The Sky Devouring Demon Wolves clan, others have also emitted sounds of admiration.
<br><br>Especially some single female demon wolves had starlight in their eyes and looked like they were committing nymphomania.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"You're welcome you're welcome."
<br><br>Listening to this sound of praise, Bone Ben Wei could not help but raise his chest, could not help but pretend to be modest and said: "In fact, I am not as powerful as you guys say, will these seven little guys elevated to immortality, I still have to consume a lot, it is estimated that it will take a night of spending and drinking to make up for it ah!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said this, so the crowd present could not help but choke.
<br><br>This consumption.
<br><br>Really big ah!
<br><br>But Ao Zhong immediately captured the true meaning, throwing a reassuring look at Bone Ben Wei, patting his bladder and saying, "Don't worry, I'll arrange it."
<br><br>Ao Zhong seemed to remember something else and hurriedly asked towards Ao Qing at the side, "Uh yes Qing'er, this high person should be the supreme master you conveyed before, right?"
<br><br>At the sound of his voice, the rest of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan also looked over.
<br><br>"Father, what are you babbling about?" Ao Qing frowned and said, "This is my big brother, the master is the master, and is not the same person."
<br><br>"Not bad, I'm just the master's servant, the master's number one fighter, the name Scum Bone Ben Wei." Bone Ben Wei also said at the side.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>These words caused the crowd present to be shocked once again.
<br><br>The Jedi master was someone else?
<br><br>What made them capture the important confidence even more was that this scum who created immortality with his bare hands had just said himself that he was just a servant of that one, that one's fighter.
<br><br>If a servant has the strength to create immortals with his bare hands, then what kind of terrifying strength does the true supreme being have?
<br><br>Inevitably, all the people of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan yearned for the real appearance of this high person.
<br><br>However, Milk Leopard Li did not think so.
<br><br>Secretly thinking, if you had seen the terrifying scene of that person breaking the sky with one fist, I'm afraid you wouldn't think so.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow, thank you grandpa."
<br><br>At this time, the seven coyotes cheered excitedly and looked at Night Wind and Milk Dose again.
<br><br>"Third Uncle your scales are so beautiful!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, and Fourth Uncle your belly."
<br><br>"We want to play we want to play."
<br><br>"Good boy, discerning, since you like Uncle Three's scales so much, then Uncle Three will play with them for you!"
<br><br>"Whoosh!"
<br><br>As soon as the night wind centipede's voice fell, a huge breath erupted from him, then a 10,000 feet long centipede stood up on the plain and went straight to the top of the clouds.
<br><br>"Come, little ones, come to the top of your third uncle's head and take you on a roller coaster ride."
<br><br>The centipede's body moved and snaked into a complex passage that towered down, allowing the seven coyotes to slide down his scales, while the hundred feet were protecting the surrounding area, carefully preventing them from danger.
<br><br>"Ahahahaha."
<br><br>"So happy."
<br><br>One coyote slid down the scales, emitting a milky and happy voice, and then climbed back up to the top of Night Wind's head.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Just then, there was a boom, and the milkshake grew violently larger, its huge body occupying a small half of the plain, then lying flat on the ground, patting its belly and shouting.
<br><br>"Little ones, I'll take you to play some new tricks."
<br><br>"Jump down quickly."
<br><br>The coyotes' eyes lit up and they stood directly on top of the Night Wind Centipede's head and jumped down from the towering sky.
<br><br>Landing on the belly of the milk dope, they bounced up again in a tentative manner.
<br><br>For a while, the coyotes were laughing and playing.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan and Milk Leopard Li and the others were trembling on the side.
<br><br>This motherfucker.
<br><br>You guys are having fun, but this bear and a centipede revealed all over the breath, but they will be scared enough ah!
<br><br>But these seven coyotes really have a lot of love in one ah!
<br><br>This motherfucker, with this grandfather and two uncles, the whole immortal river continent who fucking dare to mess with?
<br><br>"Son, you are really awesome."
<br><br>"Your father my group of foxes and friends, topping you here half, your father now I am not this way."
<br><br>Ao Zhong endured the intimidating pressure with difficulty and gave a thumbs up towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Qing Yu Immortal Continent Lord Su Xuanjun sat at the top, frowning tightly.
<br><br>And beside him, there stood a figure with a thick breath, among them were demon, human, and giant races.
<br><br>In the Immortal World, it is not as opposed to the Immortal River Continent, where strength is everything, plus the vast territory and the ascendants of the major realms, so gathered countless races.
<br><br>Therefore, these human-demon races standing beside Su Xuanjun are his right-hand men.
<br><br>"It's been so long since Black Feather went down to a tiny lower realm, why hasn't he heard back yet?"
<br><br>He asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Continent Lord, this Black Feather has always been eccentric in nature, he couldn't have betrayed the Continent Lord and defected to another continent in the name of investigating the lower realm, right?" At this moment, someone guessed.
<br><br>"That would not be the case."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun waved his hand and said confidently: "Black feather followed me for more than ten thousand years, and I have a very good relationship, and I also treat him well, especially I know that it likes to eat raw meat, so it is fed with Heavenly Immortal meat every day, so the probability is that there is some kind of change that needs to be resolved!"
<br><br>Sky-devouring demon wolf plain.
<br><br>"Big brother, although I came from the immortal world, or the Green Jade Immortal Continent Lord's cronies, but I really was forced to ah!
<br><br>Black feather kneeling in front of the skeleton Ben Wei, said from the bottom of his heart: "That old bastard simply do not treat me as a person, no, do not treat me as a bird, the most damned is, every day feed me raw meat, enough to let me eat 10,000 years, but I really are about to vomit, I am clearly with the scum big brother, like to drink and eat cooked food ah!"
<br><br>"So you believe me, I couldn't have been sent down by that old bastard to cause havoc, I just wanted to escape that bastard's clutches."
<br><br>"Therefore, you must not doubt my loyalty."
<br><br>"I am sincere, from the bottom of my heart, as long as you don't kill me, I will be your little brother, and I will do whatever you tell me to do."
