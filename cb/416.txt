Night can find that he completely underestimated Yi Feng, from the point of view of Yi Feng's words revealed, Yi Feng completely surpassed his perception.
<br><br>"Forget it, there's no need to dwell on this topic, it's not a level." Yi Feng shook his head and said, secretly sighing at the pedantry of these otherworldly natives.
<br><br>A lot of things never only look at the map, heard from others, never pay their own practice, quite some sitting on the well to see the sky.
<br><br>This is the same as the ancient people in his previous life, never know that the earth is round.
<br><br>And as a modern man, his thinking is naturally different.
<br><br>Only out of the Earth, only to know what the Earth looks like, to know the galaxy outside the Earth, the solar system, but also to know how small the Earth in the universe.
<br><br>In short, Yi Feng is also right.
<br><br>In terms of ideology, the two are indeed not a level.
<br><br>To Yi Feng's words, the night can not be half angry, on the contrary, lowered his head a look of being taught.
<br><br>Because he and Yi Feng, indeed is not a level of people ah!
<br><br>Also considered in Yi Feng here opened eyes. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After all, in the past, crossing two domains in one night was something he didn't even dare to think about.
<br><br>After changing the subject, there was another burst of pleasantries.
<br><br>Outside the door, the snow seemed to be falling even heavier.
<br><br>"This day in the North Sea, it has become a bit sudden and somewhat unpredictable!" Yi Feng side-eyed, could not help but sigh.
<br><br>Looking at the out-of-body Yi Feng, the two father and daughter of Night Energy were slightly startled.
<br><br>Mister.
<br><br>Is this revealing some message to them?
<br><br>The two sat upright and listened with rapt attention.
<br><br>"This sudden snowstorm, is already a lot of people died!" Yi Feng sighed again.
<br><br>North Sea weather before, although also cold, but long ago there are signs of a turnaround, this situation, I'm afraid many people did not anticipate this time will suddenly change the sky, many people were caught off guard.
<br><br>This way, just in the official pond city, he saw a lot of curled up in the street corners, bridge holes frozen to death starving people.
<br><br>A sigh of relief.
<br><br>Even if it is a mysterious world, after all, the poor people are mostly ah!
<br><br>"The sudden snowstorm, a lot of people died ......"
<br><br>Night can carefully stare at Yi Feng, secretly chewed Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>Murphy.
<br><br>Sir is talking to me about the situation in the North Sea?
<br><br>Thinking of this, Night Energy suddenly realized.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>Such as the spiral organization such as never heard of, but the outrageously strong forces suddenly appeared, and there are all kinds of things that have not emerged in the dark surging, this North Sea is not a sudden change in the sky, sudden rain and wind?
<br><br>And this storm, has died a lot of people, is not exactly the same?
<br><br>For example, the Fang family, the Yun family, which was exterminated by the organization of the parade, is this.
<br><br>Even his night family, if not Yi Feng's hand to destroy the organization, also followed the same footsteps.
<br><br>"In your opinion, how long will the storm continue to fall?"
<br><br>Night can ask tentatively.
<br><br>"Should still be a long, long time ...... and I'm afraid the big storm is still behind."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the sky outside, boldly guessed, his mother's hail are smashed down, a short time I'm afraid it really will not return to warm.
<br><br>"The big storm is still at the back, and will continue for a long, long time ......"
<br><br>Night can heart a thud, gaze narrowed his eyes.
<br><br>It seems that this North Sea storm, is not as simple as he said on the surface ah! Just, as a native of the North Sea, how should they survive this storm?
<br><br>But although the night can not bottom in mind, but also did not how to panic.
<br><br>After all, they are not already on line with the seniors, he believed that since Yi Feng revealed this to him, he should show him the way.
<br><br>He just did not dare to ask.
<br><br>He could only wait for Yi Feng's next revelation.
<br><br>"There seems to be no firewood!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the campfire in front of him and couldn't help but frown, this fire was burning really fast.
<br><br>Originally he could have used flame beads to keep warm, but in this windy and snowy weather, the value of flame beads is greatly increased.
<br><br>Maybe there are frozen to death to snatch, before robbing his seven people is not so?
<br><br>So Huai Bi guilty of the reason he understands, put away the flame beads long ago.
<br><br>Just this temple indeed no firewood, the campfire in front of him or he put a few discarded door slabs inside to split down to light up, how can next be good?
<br><br>Thought about it, no way Yi Feng multiplied the two not paying attention, from the ring of space took out a few wooden carvings.
<br><br>These several wooden carvings out, the night can father and daughter two immediately look silly.
<br><br>Just now the night can just with the eyes of the statue of a glance, then feel a tremor.
<br><br>This lifelike statue, which contains a great power ah!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What the father and daughter did not expect was that Yi Feng directly threw the wooden statue in his hand into the bonfire.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Night Energy saw this and fiercely stood up.
<br><br>This this, this, this atrocity!
<br><br>He looked at Yi Feng with a puzzled face and asked, "Sir, such a wooden carving, you, why are you burning it ah."
<br><br>"There is no firewood." Yi Feng said helplessly: "But it does not matter, before the practice of carving skills carved by hand, these are not much better, it is just some defective products, burned also burned."
<br><br>"Ruined, defective!
<br><br>Night can teeth are shivering.
<br><br>This gentleman's handwriting, really big to the sky ah.
<br><br>This random wood carving, enough to be their night family heirloom, in the eyes of this man, actually just used as firewood?
