Look at the dog's sitting next to the spicy strips, looking at him expectantly.
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head no way, so he grabbed a handful of spicy strips and threw them to the dog, while looking at the pot of spicy strips, and said to himself, "But this spicy strip, have to fill a bag, eat it to have the essence of ah!"
<br><br>The dog gratefully bowed his head towards Yi Feng, biting into the spicy strips and ran out of the martial arts school.
<br><br>"Keep it!"
<br><br>Finding Uncle Yun again, the dog instructed, "Tell that old man to eat two of them at the moment of duress!"
<br><br>"This, this is?"
<br><br>Yun Bo looked curiously at the spicy stick in his hand, full of doubts, this thing is really that powerful?
<br><br>Can directly make the imperial family lineage turn defeat into victory?
<br><br>Unable to help, he subconsciously bit into a small section.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>This bite went down, he immediately straightened his back, staring with eyes full of incredulity. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And his cultivation actually soared straight up, starting from the demon spirit breakthrough across several small orders, directly to the demon king realm.
<br><br>"This ...... this this this this ......"
<br><br>Yun Bo shivered, just can't even speak well.
<br><br>"This is only the master's small means but, no need to be too surprised, bring him back to that old man!" Ao Qing's face was flat and did not show any surprise.
<br><br>After all, this spicy strip made him a demon daddy eat, cultivation can be refined a few points, let alone a small demon spirit?
<br><br>Besides, they have experienced such unreal things from the demon king to the demon dweller, this is not called a matter.
<br><br>Saying that, Ao Qing turned around and left.
<br><br>However, seems to remember something, he turned back and said: "Remember, find a bag to carry, the master said, inside the bag to eat is considered the essence!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Yun Bo carefully put the spicy strip away, as if he had won a treasure never dared to have any doubts about the effect of this spicy strip, then found a bag to put it in, kicked it in his arms and left.
<br><br>The whole way.
<br><br>He was careful.
<br><br>After all, he understood that what he was kicking in his arms at the moment was the future of the entire royal family lineage!
<br><br>"Greetings to the Devouring Heavenly Emperor!"
<br><br>After the trek, Uncle Yun finally returned to the Heaven Devouring Hall and came next to the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>"Well, didn't you bring Ao Qing back, where is he?" The Heaven Devouring Emperor looked at Yun Bo who was laying his hands on him and asked leisurely.
<br><br>"Third prince, he had important matters to attend to and couldn't come back, but he brought me surprising treasures, please look at them, Your Majesty the Wolf Emperor."
<br><br>Saying that, Uncle Yun carefully pulled out the spicy bar tucked in his arms.
<br><br>"A surprising treasure?"
<br><br>"Just this?"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor lightly glanced at the spicy strip, revealed a disdainful voice, and said in a deep voice: "Ao Yun ah, I know you have a good relationship with Qing'er, and usually have no problem protecting him, but you still tell such lies in front of this Emperor in order to embrace him, what crime should you be guilty of?"
<br><br>When his voice fell, Ao Yun fell to his knees in fear.
<br><br>"The Wolf Emperor does not dare, this is really a surprising treasure!" Ao Yun said respectfully.
<br><br>"Hmph, I'm still not sure about that waste son of mine, what surprising treasure could he want you to bring back?" The Heaven Devouring Emperor snorted lightly and said, "You should stop saying that, for the sake of your usual loyalty, I won't pursue you this time."
<br><br>"Wolf Emperor, I really didn't lie to you." Ao Yun knelt on the ground and continued, "And the third prince is not a waste as you said, but because of the help of a precious person, he has reached the Demon Dignity realm."
<br><br>"Demon Dignity?"
<br><br>Ao Zhong was first shocked, then his voice was tinged with sulking anger, "Ao Yun, you're blowing even more than that old man Ao Jin, if you're still like this, this emperor is really angry!"
<br><br>"Wolf Emperor, I did not tell half a lie, you will know once you try!" Ao Yun offered his hands to the spicy strip in his hand and said respectfully.
<br><br>"Good, then if it's not like what you said, then I will execute you?"
<br><br>Ao Zhong sunken face, staring at the kneeling Ao Yun sullenly said, at this moment he is really angry, originally in this crisis, a small housekeeper, actually also teased to his head!
<br><br>"At the disposal of the Wolf Emperor."
<br><br>Aoyun continued to kneel on the ground and said without the slightest hesitation.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Ao Zhong's face was even more sunken, lowering his voice and said, "Ao Yun ah Ao Yun, then it seems that you are really looking for death, then fine, I will satisfy you."
<br><br>Saying that, he snatched the bag in Ao Yun's hand, disdainfully glanced at it, and bit off half of the bag in one bite.
<br><br>PS: All in place, no broken promises.
