In an instant.
<br><br>The disciples from both sides got entangled together.
<br><br>At first it was just a test, but when someone died on one side, the situation began to change.
<br><br>Both sides were thousands of disciples, killing each other, and suddenly blood filled the air.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>Both sides killed each other.
<br><br>Limbs and broken legs were everywhere, and the smell of blood filled the whole mountain.
<br><br>And Yang Yi naturally took on Qi Tian.
<br><br>But as soon as he met Qi Tian, Yang Yi realized something was wrong.
<br><br>"You, you are actually also a Xuan Xian?"
<br><br>Yang Yi's brow was furrowed and filled with gloom. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This Sun Moon Peak, really hide dragons and crouching tigers.
<br><br>The three brothers of the Heavenly Mansion first, and now Qi Tian, a Xuan Xian, has appeared.
<br><br>After clashing a palm with Qi Tian, Yang Yi flew backwards and hit the ground.
<br><br>He got up with his injured body and tried to call out to the Star Peak disciples to take Yi Feng to retreat.
<br><br>After all, this level of battle is looking at a high-end battle force.
<br><br>The other side has a Xuan Xian.
<br><br>Then they Star Peak how to have to suffer a loss.
<br><br>But raising his eyes, he found that the two sides had long fought white-hot, and simply could not retreat in one piece.
<br><br>This made Yang Yi lost his sense of proportion.
<br><br>Qi Tian licked his tongue and seemed to be simply interested in Yang Yi even playing with him, and another palm then enveloped towards Yang Yi.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Yang Yi flew backwards several thousand feet.
<br><br>Under this palm, the chest directly collapsed, mixed with the blood of the internal organs, directly a mouthful of spray.
<br><br>Yang Yi, who fell to the ground, was filled with unwillingness.
<br><br>"Is this the difference between a Golden Immortal and a Xuan Immortal?"
<br><br>His eyes darkened.
<br><br>Almost in a single glance, he was defeated.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Qi Tian smiled coldly.
<br><br>Although he was a little surprised that Yang Yi didn't die, he wasn't interested in chasing after him.
<br><br>In his opinion, Yang Yi and the other Star Peak disciples were no different, they were all just dead people.
<br><br>Like a wolf entering a flock of sheep, he rushed directly into the Star Peak disciples and began to kill them indiscriminately.
<br><br>His body was filled with black light, and he possessed a strange immortal energy that was different from normal people.
<br><br>What was even more strange was that every time he killed someone, the strength in his body seemed to get stronger by one point.
<br><br>In a short while.
<br><br>Star Peak disciples were slaughtered by Qi Tian by hundreds of people.
<br><br>In itself, there was a disparity between Star Peak and Sun Moon Peak, and with the attrition of these hundred people, Star Peak began to fall into a bitter battle and became defeated.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Stop!"
<br><br>Watching each and every Star Peak disciple fall, the heavily wounded Yang Yi's eyes were covered with blood and hissed out.
<br><br>But the severely injured man could not even wield the weapon in his hand.
<br><br>He could only watch the disciples of Star Peak fall one by one.
<br><br>......
<br><br>And at this moment, Yi Feng.
<br><br>Still sitting on the ground, the battle in front of him is not involved.
<br><br>The body shines with a leisurely light.
<br><br>Such as chaos.
<br><br>Like the morning light and sunset.
<br><br>And deep in his mind, there came that familiar voice.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"The system is being upgraded."
<br><br>"System upgrade one percent ......"
<br><br>"System upgrade 10 percent ......"
<br><br>"System upgrade 50 percent ......"
<br><br>And at the same time of system upgrade ......
<br><br>The dark shadow island surrounded by the black sea.
<br><br>"Bulu Bulu."
<br><br>"Blah blah blah!"
<br><br>"Blublublub ......"
<br><br>"Quack la quack la nima ......"
<br><br>"And Brrrrrrrrrr your mother ......"
<br><br>Frog Ben Wei and Slow Ben Wei were fighting fiercely when they seemed to sense something and the two looked up to the sky.
<br><br>"Is it finally time for the first stage?"
<br><br>Slow Benway said meaningfully, his face could not say what emotions.
<br><br>Also at the same time, the skeleton Ben Wei, who was surrounded by dozens of exposed ladies paddling in the middle of space steps, also suddenly took a step.
<br><br>A wave of white bone palm.
<br><br>The surrounding space instantly stilled, the ladies kept their posture motionless, as if frozen.
<br><br>He lifted his skull and looked into the sky with the same solemn look.
<br><br>Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>Tiandi Gate Lake Island.
<br><br>In the courtyard behind the martial arts school, an old acacia tree with falling leaves suddenly made a movement, and an old giant face coalesced out of the trunk, looking into the sky with a tense look ......
<br><br>......
<br><br>"System upgrade 99 percent ......"
<br><br>"System upgrade 100 percent ......"
<br><br>"System upgrade successful."
<br><br>"Reward the host cultivation level 50!"
<br><br>The system upgrade was finally complete.
<br><br>The sound that then appeared filled Yi Feng with joy, wrapped in fiddling joy.
<br><br>Fifty levels.
<br><br>This dog system.
<br><br>Suddenly gave him a fifty level upgrade!
<br><br>That is to say, his current Golden Immortal realm words, plus fifty levels ......
<br><br>Late Golden Immortal, First Turn Xuan Immortal, Second Turn Xuan Immortal ......
<br><br>Reincarnation Immortal Mirror early stage, Reincarnation Immortal Mirror middle stage, Reincarnation Immortal Mirror late stage, Reincarnation Immortal Realm complete ......
<br><br>Early Stage of True Element Immortal Realm, Middle Stage of True Element Immortal Realm, Late Stage of True Element Immortal Realm, Complete Stage of True Element Immortal Realm ......
<br><br>Star Immortal Realm early stage, Star Immortal Realm mid stage, Star Immortal Realm late stage, Star Immortal Realm complete ......
<br><br>Hiss.
<br><br>Yi Feng found that he could not calculate at all.
<br><br>Because even if he counted to the Star Immortal Realm Complete, he had only increased by more than twenty levels, nowhere near enough for fifty levels.
<br><br>As for the later realms, he didn't know at all.
<br><br>But in his heart, he understood that if the Star Immortal Realm consummation pushed another twenty or so levels backwards, even if he wasn't invincible in the Immortal Realm, he could still walk around.
<br><br>But just when Yi Feng was excited.
<br><br>Suddenly there were countless images that were strangely presented in front of his eyes.
<br><br>These images.
<br><br>All of them were actually himself.
<br><br>He saw himself at the top of his talent, getting stronger and stronger, becoming a saint son, becoming a patriarch, becoming an overlord, and finally dying out in the long river of time ......
<br><br>He saw himself again, his hands filled with blood, treating human life like grass, and finally dying under his own heart's demon.
<br><br>See yourself again, one person, one sword, wandering the world, and finally widowed life ......
<br><br>Another saw himself, powerful, wives and concubines, the admiration of thousands of people, but finally died under the assassination of his enemies ......
<br><br>Not long after, he saw countless of himself.
<br><br>And at the end, he saw a world, no, to be precise, a universe destroyed ......
<br><br>"This is, this is?"
<br><br>The appearance of this image made Yi Feng, who was originally joyful, feel panic and disbelief, making his joy of gaining cultivation disappear instantly.
<br><br>He shook his head full of doubts.
<br><br>Why did he see such a picture?
<br><br>Why every image, is a miserable end?
<br><br>And the universe that was destroyed at the end, what did it represent?
<br><br>He gradually woke up.
<br><br>The sound of violent killing came to his ears.
<br><br>The smell of blood also came to his nose.
<br><br>Feeling the countless dead Star Peak disciples around him, Yi Feng was instantly pulled back to reality.
<br><br>"Forget about what I just saw for now, what matters is the battle in front of me."
<br><br>"Just in time, let me try what it's like to be elevated by fifty levels!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>Suddenly opened up!
