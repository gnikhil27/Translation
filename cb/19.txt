 "Do you know what it was in the ancient times, with the Ping River as the root, for a radius of ten thousand miles?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan asked.
<br><br>Zhu Yun shook his head not knowing.
<br><br>"Ancient books have clouds, in the ancient times, the Ping River for 10,000 square miles is the land of immortals, although later for unknown reasons fell, but since ancient times, the Ping River is also a place of warriors, enough to show that the Ping River is not an ordinary place." The old ancestor of Green Mountain explained.
<br><br>"But, what does this have to do with this senior?" Zhu Yun asked doubtfully.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan sighed emotionally, I don't know if he was lamenting this Zhu Yun's stupidity or why, pondering for a long time before he said, "Pingjiang must be hiding secrets unknown to the people, so this senior may also be using Pingjiang as the foundation, the entire Nansha as the scope, playing a big game of amazing chess!"
<br><br>When the words of Old Ancestor Qing Shan fell, it caused Zhu Yun's body to tremble violently.
<br><br>Using Pingjiang as the base and Nansha as the scope, a great game of chess was being played.
<br><br>Just thinking about this kind of gesture, one can feel as terrifying as this! But he as the Castle Peak Sect Sect Master did not even dare to imagine.
<br><br>But if not, as strong as Yi Feng such a supreme master, there how would appear in a small place like Pingjiang City?
<br><br>"But Master, if that's really the case, then wouldn't we?" Seeming to have thought of something, Zhu Yun asked with wide eyes in fear.
<br><br>"Not bad." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan did not deny, "If that is really the case, then we are all pawns in each."
<br><br>"Then what can be done?" Zhu Yun said apprehensively.
<br><br>"Foolish."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan glared at Zhu Yun and lectured, "If you had thought about it differently, you wouldn't have this worry."
<br><br>"What do you mean, Senior Uncle?"
<br><br>"Good, being able to become a pawn of senior is not a bad thing in my opinion, rather it is the greatest opportunity for my Castle Peak Sect." Speaking of this, the old ancestor of Castle Peak let out a sigh and said, "Since five hundred years, my Castle Peak Sect is declining day by day, pessimistically speaking sooner or later will be drowned in the long river of history, and even if not, it is just lingering."
<br><br>"Are you willing to do that?"
<br><br>The voice of the old ancestor of Castle Peak fell into Zhu Yun's ears, causing his heart and soul to tremble.
<br><br>Are you willing?
<br><br>Definitely not.
<br><br>But could one really get what he wished for as Old Ancestor Qing Shan had said?
<br><br>"However, Senior's mind is impenetrable to us, so we can take the opportunity to inquire and ask Senior."
<br><br>"Go."
<br><br>"Follow me into the house."
<br><br>Two people walked into the martial arts hall one after the other.
<br><br>The first time he walked into the front hall, Zhu Yun fell directly into the eighteen pictures, but it was good that the experienced Old Man Qingshan pulled him back.
<br><br>But even so, Zhu Yun was scared enough, a cold sweat broke out all over his body.
<br><br>This time, he was completely convinced of the strength of this martial arts school master.
<br><br>There were no more knots in his heart about becoming a pawn, and he had even seen the moment when the Castle Peak Sect was back on top.
<br><br>"Huh, where is Grandmaster Yi?"
<br><br>Passing through the front hall and coming to the small courtyard at the back, but no trace of Yi Feng was found, but it was Zhu Yun who was scared enough to point at the acacia tree and said shiveringly, "Master uncle, look, look, it's a sky-devouring demon wolf!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan took a look at the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf bolted under the old acacia tree and said with contempt, "Is it necessary to make such a fuss?"
<br><br>"Senior Uncle, that's a Heaven-devouring Demon Wolf?" Zhu Yun continued to exclaim.
<br><br>"Look at you like that."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan gave Zhu Yun a white glance as if he was looking at a country bumpkin.
<br><br>It's just a Heaven-devouring Demon Wolf, last time he came, he almost let the senior use it to drink wine, what's the big deal.
<br><br>Of course, when he thought this, he completely forgot that he was no better than Zhu Yun.
<br><br>"Sorry, just went inside and cooked some rice, you guys feel free to sit down." At this time, Yi Feng came out from the kitchen, while holding a kitchen knife in his hand.
<br><br>Seeing this kitchen knife, the originally polite old man of the green hill suddenly trembled, his eyes deadly stared at the kitchen knife in Yi Feng's hand.
<br><br>Zhu Yun on the side was still in shock from the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf and had not slowed down, when his gaze was cast over, the whole person was like a lightning strike.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>At this moment, he simply did not know what to describe his mood, it was simply one wave before another.
<br><br>In short, this chopper was even bigger than the shock he had seen the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf bring.
<br><br>For a while, both of them looked at the knife in Yi Feng's hand with dead eyes, while the Old Ancestor of Green Mountain guessed what exactly was Yi Feng's intention for suddenly taking out this knife?
<br><br>Could it be?
<br><br>Could it be?
<br><br>The thought of this, the old ancestor of the green hill body excited pendulum, especially watching Yi Feng holding the kitchen knife step by step approach, his breathing more and more sharply.
