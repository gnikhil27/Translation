 Just when old man Wu was smiling and waiting for Yi Feng to be surprised, Yi Feng put the rake in his hand.
<br><br>"You do have some problems with this rake head." Yi Feng shook his head and then said softly, "And it doesn't work very well anymore."
<br><br>Although the rake head is not much broken, but some places on it have rusted, and the shape is too damn ugly, and I do not know is that stupid hanging thing designed, I guess old man Wu with this rake head rake up the soil is also strange hard.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The imagined shock of Yi Feng did not, but also put his holy rake down a bit, old man Wu immediately exploded, fierce stand up.
<br><br>If he hadn't been unable to see Yi Feng's cultivation level and didn't quite dare to act rashly, at this moment he would have fought with Yi Feng. The hall is close to the holy product, his life is proud of something, actually by Yi Feng such desecration, simply can not tolerate.
<br><br>See old man Wu this fried look, Yi Feng at first some confusion, but on second thought can understand.
<br><br>Although this is the cultivation world, but most of the ordinary people, the ordinary people here and the earth's ordinary people are no different, most of them rely on farming to eat.
<br><br>And for old man Wu, the rake head is the guy he eats, the guy who eats has a problem, it's strange not to be anxious.
<br><br>"You take it easy." Yi Feng raised his hand to comfort.
<br><br>But old man Wu still red face, staring dead at Yi Feng, the heart has long been anger can not rest. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"You wait for me a moment."
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and turned to walk into the inner room.
<br><br>"Good, since you look down on my Seven-Tooth Sacred Rake so much, then I want to see what else you can come up with that can compare to my Seven-Tooth Sacred Rake!" Seeing Yi Feng enter the house, Old Man Wu chanted secretly with a red face.
<br><br>Yi Feng returned to the house for a moment, and then walked out again, while saying, "That rake head in your hand is too broken, throw it away."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words instantly made old man Wu's anger boil up and go straight to his head.
<br><br>It's not enough to belittle his Seven-Tooth Sacred Rake, but to say that the Seven-Tooth Sacred Rake is too broken, throw it away?
<br><br>This is not belittling anymore, but mocking.
<br><br>It's a mockery!
<br><br>He stood up fiercely and asked Yi Feng to give a statement.
<br><br>But the next moment, his whole person was stunned.
<br><br>Like a lightning strike!
<br><br>Eyes deadly stared at Yi Feng's hand - the brand new rake.
<br><br>Seemingly afraid that he was wrong, he hurriedly rubbed his eyes, and when he looked clearly again, he couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air again.
<br><br>"This, this is ......"
<br><br>For a moment, he became slurred, his body could not help but tremble.
<br><br>The shock in his heart at this moment he really could not use words to describe, because this rake in Yi Feng's hand, is a real holy product.
<br><br>And it was a brand-new, not the slightest bit broken, holy product divine rake!
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>After a long, long time, Old Man Wu took a breather and looked at Yi Feng with an even deeper gaze.
<br><br>No wonder, no wonder this person would be so derogatory and mocking towards his Seven-Tooth Sacred Rake, it turned out that he had a real Sacred Item in his hand, Old Man Wu could no longer raise his anger in his heart while holding back the unbearable.
<br><br>His Seven-Tooth Divine Rake was indeed precious, but the broken one was indeed not worth mentioning in front of the real holy item.
<br><br>"Who the hell are you?"
<br><br>Old man Wu locked his eyebrows and stared at Yi Feng and asked word by word.
<br><br>"What kind of person do you think I am?"
<br><br>It was estimated that this old man's middle-aged disease was back, so Yi Feng directly gave him a white glance.
<br><br>Old man Wu nodded his head.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>A person who casually took out the Flame Beads and casually took out the Sacred Divine Item, what kind of person was he, wasn't it clear?
<br><br>He sat down on the stool in dismay.
<br><br>Although he had never been able to see through Yi Feng's cultivation level, he had always thought that the two should be at the same level of existence, which could not help but stir up his competitive spirit.
<br><br>So the obsession in his heart made him want to compete with Yi Feng to a higher or lower level.
<br><br>But the final result was not as he wished.
<br><br>He also finally understood that his inability to see through Yi Feng's cultivation was not because Yi Feng had cultivated some unknown technique, but was truly too strong for him to see through.
<br><br>He no longer had a competitive mind.
<br><br>On the contrary, look at Yi Feng's gaze with a little fear and deference.
<br><br>After all, the strong are the strongest in this world.
<br><br>Seeing Old Man Wu froze, Yi Feng couldn't help but shout, "Hey old man, what are you frothing at?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Old Man Wu's face looked ugly, a look of sweat, and he could only smile awkwardly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Got it, take it, keep it."
<br><br>Yi Feng handed over the rake in his hand and said with a smile.
<br><br>Old man Wu did not react at first, after reacting, his brain was like a lightning strike, stood up violently and stared at Yi Feng with a deadly stare.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Give it to me?"
