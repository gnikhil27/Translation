Three days later.
<br><br>A big event happened in the West Ning Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Lu Zun, the son of the Grand Elder of the Great Harmony Sect, burned down the branch of the Heaven's Immortal Palace in the West Ning Immortal Continent with a fire.
<br><br>The administrator of the Heaven's Immortal Palace in the West Ning Immortal Continent was furious.
<br><br>On the spot, Lu Zun was beaten half to death, not to mention that he was now going to be punished by being imprisoned in the Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>And because of this matter.
<br><br>Great Harmony Sect held an emergency meeting.
<br><br>At the meeting.
<br><br>Grand Elder Lu Zun had become the target of criticism.
<br><br>"Lu Zun, Lu Zun, look what trouble you have brought to our Great Harmony Sect!"
<br><br>"Yes Lu Zun, your son's cultivation strength is not good enough, how come you can't manage this?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Dare to burn the branch hall of the Heavenly Immortal Hall, the nerve is too fat!"
<br><br>"Do you know how bad an impression the Heaven's Immortal Hall has brought to our Great Harmony Sect because of your son's matter!"
<br><br>Facing the criticism of the elders and the sect master.
<br><br>Lu Zun was silent, completely ignoring their words, while in his heart, he was thinking about the effect of his own son when he was inside the Dark Shadow Island, after three months of further training.
<br><br>I think after coming out.
<br><br>Can to Xuan Xian, right?
<br><br>Thinking of this, he could not help but raise the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the crowd of elders who were criticizing him had an angry face.
<br><br>"Look, Patriarch, Lu Zun is actually laughing, simply too much to put us in his eyes." An elder shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>Patriarch Fang Scarf of the Great Harmony Patriarch also had a slightly sunken face.
<br><br>"Lu Zun, in view of what your son has committed, we have unanimously decided to expel your son from the Great Harmony Sect." Fang Scarf announced.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Lu Zun finally stopped being calm and his face was tinged with anger.
<br><br>He didn't mind being criticized.
<br><br>But to also expel his son from the clan, that is not ......
<br><br>"Patriarch, you grew up with Chon's son, although he is not strong, but he has given a lot to the sect over the years, right?"
<br><br>"You just expelled him from the clan?"
<br><br>"Alas!" Fang Scarf patted Lu Zun's shoulder and said, "You also know how badly your son has affected my Great Harmony Sect."
<br><br>"If we don't expel him from the sect, our Great Harmony Sect will forever have to carry the title of being against the Heaven's Immortal Hall."
<br><br>"Furthermore, if he enters the Dark Shadow Island, it is the same as being sentenced to death, so what effect does it have on him personally if he is still a member of the Great Harmony Sect?"
<br><br>This remark.
<br><br>It made Lu Zun angry quite a lot.
<br><br>Their Lu family, for generations, had served the Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>His eldest son, Lu Chong's brother, had died in a sect war between the Great Harmony Sect and other sects.
<br><br>Now this matter, let Fang Scarf and others have opinions, he was expected, so criticism and criticism he does not matter.
<br><br>But directly expelled Lu Chong from the sect, it really made his heart chill.
<br><br>"I ask you, what if my son comes back?" Lu Zun asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Come back?"
<br><br>"Lu Zun you are too whimsical, right?"
<br><br>"You still want to come back after going to Shadow Island?"
<br><br>Several elders couldn't help but speak out coldly.
<br><br>Lu Zun didn't pay attention to them, but continued to look at Fang Scarf.
<br><br>"He can't come back."
<br><br>Fang Scarf said with a majestic face, "Even if he comes back, the decision has already been made, withdrawing not to return, Lu Chong from now on, is no longer a member of my Great Harmony Sect."
<br><br>"Well, well ......"
<br><br>Lu Zun was a little trembling with anger.
<br><br>"I hope you guys don't regret it."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>He angrily flung his robe sleeve and left.
<br><br>Looking at Lu Zun's angry appearance, many elders looked on with cold eyes, and more even laughed mockingly.
<br><br>And at this moment, Lu Chong.
<br><br>Has entered the Shadow Island.
<br><br>Is full of wretched face eating dirt.
<br><br>But did not know that someone was staring at him in the dark.
<br><br>This has become the process of the Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>Chu Mad Lion was staring at this thing.
<br><br>According to his words, all prisoners who enter the Shadow Island, first let him experience half a month of misery.
<br><br>If you don't experience it.
<br><br>How can one feel how lucky it is to be under the disciple of Mr.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>After half a month, Chu Wild Lion found him with his men, and after kowtowing and vowing to always honor Mr., he finally became a member of Yi Feng's disciples.
<br><br>After becoming a member of the sect, Chu Mad Lion was also responsible for assigning their tasks.
<br><br>At that very moment, Lu Dasheng came over carrying a pair of dung buckets.
<br><br>"Old Chu, is there a newcomer again?" Lu Dasheng asked.
<br><br>"Yes, old Lu, what brings you here, what's the matter?" Chu Mad Lion said with a smile.
<br><br>"This is not the island construction, the amount of manure, manpower seems to be a little short, see you bring new people, so I came to you, want you to assign me one." Lu Dasheng laughed.
<br><br>"Oh, so this is the matter ah, well, to see if the newcomer is satisfied?" Chu Mad Lion laughed, then pushed Lu Chong out and said, "Look, this is the young man."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng looked around Lu Chong, then patted his shoulder and said, "Not bad, the young man looks quite sturdy, is a good handle to pick dung, you're it."
<br><br>"Young man, you are still frozen, you are afraid that you do not know how lucky you are, by the chief of manure to see, from then on to the top of life." Chu Mad Lion laughed, "Why don't you quickly meet Chief Steward Lu."
<br><br>"Greetings, Chief Steward Lu!"
<br><br>Lu Chong respectfully.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng nodded appreciatively.
<br><br>With a wave of his palm, a pair of dung buckets appeared out of thin air.
<br><br>"This is your equipment, the entry level is a bit poor, but it is also a top level immortal weapon, take it first, and get you a heaven level immortal weapon above the top level immortal weapon later!"
<br><br>Hearing this, Lu Chong's palm trembled.
<br><br>"Top, top-tier immortal weapon??"
<br><br>His mouth was stuttering, "And it's only the entry level?"
<br><br>"Many thanks, many thanks to Chief Steward Lu!"
<br><br>Lu Chong knelt on the ground.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>He was convinced of what Gong Chen said.
<br><br>He also finally believed that he was about to go to the top of his life.
<br><br>"Don't thank me, Mr. Xie."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng said indifferently, "Over there, is the residence of Mr. Daily pilgrimage!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Lu Chong kneeled on the ground and turned around, making a reverent pilgrimage towards the direction of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Afterwards, he followed the pace of Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>He finally became a member of the dung-picking team.
<br><br>A few days later.
<br><br>Lu Chong was already comfortable with picking dung.
<br><br>In one day, he was able to pick more than thirty quintals.
<br><br>The fruits rewarded down from above every day also made his cultivation level suddenly improve every day, and in just a few days he became an Eighth Turn Xuan Xian.
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>He finally ran into his senior uncle, Gong Chen, on Shadow Island.
<br><br>"Greetings, senior uncle." Lu Chong was full of gratitude.
<br><br>"Chong'er is welcome." Gong Chen said with a smile, then came closer and asked softly, "By the way, under whose hand are you currently assigned?"
<br><br>"Senior, under Chief Lu's subordinate." Lu Chong respectfully answered.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Gong Chen's eyes were raised and he laughed loudly.
<br><br>"Bravo, bravo!"
<br><br>"Chong'er your luck is really good, to be under Master Lu's subordinate is a great fortune, you must do well and listen to Master Lu's words well!"
