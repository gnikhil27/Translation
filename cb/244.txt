For a time, the fifth Changkong and Yun Xianque and others, like a chicken, kneeling on the ground, not daring to raise their heads, not even dare to breathe a breath.
<br><br>Anyway.
<br><br>At this moment don't care if it's an elder or a holy maiden, a martial daddy or a martial sect, it's no different.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"I didn't see it wrong!"
<br><br>"Duke Changkong and Miss Yun Que are actually kneeling in front of them."
<br><br>"Not only that, even the elders of the two clans, the fifth formation, Yang Mu and Yang Sen all knelt down."
<br><br>"Yeah, what the hell is going on here!?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the whole room was shocked!
<br><br>One by one, they rubbed their eyes, afraid that they had seen it wrong.
<br><br>Never thought that things would actually turn out like this. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The hearts of all people, at the same time, rose a doubt.
<br><br>These six unattractive old men, in the end, who are they?
<br><br>Surprisingly able to make as strong as a martial daddy, but also the experts of Windy Cloud Valley and Blowing Snow Villa, meet and kneel on the ground, not even the idea of resistance ......
<br><br>And Li Yihan.
<br><br>Also fiercely covered his red lips with both hands, a pair of beautiful eyes deadly stare at Pork Rong and others.
<br><br>To all this.
<br><br>She felt extremely surreal.
<br><br>This, this is still with her on the same road for so many days, encountered a group of bandits are crying father and mother?
<br><br>Looking at for her Li Yihan, high above such people as Yun Xian Que and the fifth long air, are kneeling in front of Grand Master Wang and their atmosphere do not dare to breathe appearance, Li Yihan straight feel unable to breathe.
<br><br>"You few little things, who gave you the guts to fly around in mid-air?"
<br><br>Grand Master Wang looked at Yun Xian Que and the others from a high position, and the cane in his hand knocked them over one by one on top of their heads.
<br><br>The people held their heads with a painful face, but instead of daring to have any grievances, they shouted in this head one by one not to dare.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Still quite obedient!" Porky Rong sneered and said, "But you disciples of these big sects, you are all very arrogant!"
<br><br>As Porky Rong's voice fell, the faces of the few people led by Cheng Wu suddenly changed dramatically.
<br><br>The original arrogant ones already knew that something bad was going to happen when they saw Fifth Longkong and the others kneeling on the ground.
<br><br>Even the most stupid, but also know that the few old men in front of them, but also must be strong to outrageous characters, at least the Wind and Cloud Valley and Blowing Snow Villa such a big power, also do not dare to easily offend.
<br><br>"Poof!"
<br><br>At once, a few disciples led by Cheng Wu hurriedly kneeled on the ground, one after another, opening their mouths to beg for forgiveness.
<br><br>"Seniors, we are wrong, we are wrong, please, please lift up your hands, be generous, bypass our lives ......"
<br><br>For a while, their mouths were so anxious that they were about to cry out.
<br><br>"Seniors, dare to ask, in the end they ......"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que smothered his voice and asked.
<br><br>Because no matter what, Cheng Wu and the others are also one of their sect's key cultivated disciples, even if they want to punish them, they always need to have a reason.
<br><br>"Hmph, because they made noise and affected sir's sleep, thus causing sir who had just gone to sleep to be woken up by them again." Wu Yonghong snorted coldly and continued, "So this reason, is that enough?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Affected the gentleman's sleep?"
<br><br>Hearing this, both Fifth Changkong and Yun Xianque's faces changed dramatically at this moment.
<br><br>This matter, it was simply a big mess!
<br><br>They understood very well who the gentleman Wu Yonghong was referring to.
<br><br>Thinking of that one's heavenly handiwork, the crowd remembered vividly, and actually affected this one's sleep ......
<br><br>At the thought of this, Yun Xian Que and the Fifth Longkong swept towards Cheng Wu and the others with faces full of anger almost without saying a word.
<br><br>"Senior sister senior sister, you ......"
<br><br>Cheng Wu and the others raised their heads in fear.
<br><br>"Affecting sir's sleep, you deserve to die for your sins!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que emitted an icy cold voice, looking at Cheng Wu with a face full of sighs, "This kind of heavenly mistake, no one can save you."
<br><br>Saying that, Yun Xian Que's palm fiercely fell to Peng Wu's dantian.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, Peng Wu had been wasted and was lying on the ground like a dead dog.
<br><br>And Fifth Changkong, too, had also nullified the leading Snow Blowing Villa disciple with great speed.
<br><br>The two then knelt down again in front of the few old men.
<br><br>"I wonder if several seniors and satisfied?"
<br><br>Old man Wang and the others looked at Yun Xian Que and the others, with a thoughtful look in their eyes.
<br><br>Originally had given Cheng Wu and others a chance to tell them to leave, they did not cherish the situation, with the character of old man Wang and a few of them, would have decided to kill all the people on the scene.
<br><br>But looking at Yun Xian Que and Fifth Changkong and others so sincere and so sensible, they hesitated for a moment before nodding their heads.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Xian Que and the Fifth Longkong and others were greatly relieved.
<br><br>But this scene, but once again shocked the crowd.
<br><br>They did not hear the conversation between Yun Xian Que and Wu Yonghong and others, so they speculated in their hearts, what exactly are these old men, actually let the two sects fear like this, and even do not hesitate to directly scrap their own sects' elite disciples.
<br><br>Of course, the most appalled also belongs to Li Yihan, she found herself once again underestimated the strength of old man Wang and others.
<br><br>And the big sects have such a great deterrent, I'm afraid that these mortals and she traveled all the way, their strength has been with those big sects of the patriarch, such as the Royal Sword Sect Yang Tianyu, Wind Cloud Valley Yun Haotian such characters, reached the peak of the Martial Exaltation or even half-saint it!
<br><br>But she just thought so.
<br><br>A change suddenly occurred.
<br><br>The head of the old man Wang jerked up his head, looking at several shadows flying through the mid-air, and immediately came out an angry voice.
<br><br>"Fly your seventh uncle's, and fly around, give me down!"
<br><br>Said, in the eyes of the crowd stared, old man Wang a hand suddenly reached for the sky, transformed into a huge shadow, like a big mountain towards the sky flying over a few people covered.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The few people who flew by, without the slightest power to fight back, were smashed directly to the ground high up in the sky, spitting blood.
<br><br>Just when the crowd was appalled at Old Man Wang's tactics, they suddenly saw the faces of the few people who were knocked down again.
<br><br>For a moment, the crowd's jaws were about to fall off in shock.
<br><br>Especially Li Yihan, his mouth could not help but cry out in shock.
<br><br>"They ...... they are actually, actually ......"
