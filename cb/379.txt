The reason why he had to personally go down to explore a trip is because he didn't want to be on tenterhooks like this anymore and wanted to seek peace of mind.
<br><br>If Yi Feng is really as he guessed, not so powerful, then he can live his life in peace, or even find a way to revenge.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>He is also not impulsive.
<br><br>After all, all things, it is not accurate to say.
<br><br>He came inside the death row of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, looked at the group of dead prisoners with his leisurely gaze, and then picked one of them and brought him to his retreat room.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>His mouth chanted and hand seals were frequently struck.
<br><br>Along with that dead prisoner a harsh scream, his soul was directly drawn out.
<br><br>With the divine soul withdrawn, the dead prisoner also fell to the ground in response, becoming a staring corpse.
<br><br>"Condense!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>With a soft drink, a drop of blood jumped out from Su Xuanjun's fingertips and forced its way directly towards that divine soul.
<br><br>The blood drops scattered and spread out, enveloping the whole body of the divine soul fused together, and the only remaining dead prisoner's intention on the divine soul was immediately erased.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun, a long sigh of relief.
<br><br>Showed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>Right now this divine soul is completely under his control because of the power of his essence and blood.
<br><br>At the same time the soul is completely transparent body, strictly speaking is a void, invisible and imperceptible.
<br><br>Even if it is super strong, it is no exception.
<br><br>If you take a step back, if there is any accident, he will be able to retreat.
<br><br>Because this soul is not his at all, even if the other party really has the strength of the sky can only find this dead prisoner body.
<br><br>But, this dead prisoner is already dead.
<br><br>This hand set up, can be said to be seamless, double insurance.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>This body soul body is not without weaknesses.
<br><br>The first strength is not strong, only the appearance of the Martial Emperor, but Su Xuanjun is not to fight, just to do reconnaissance, Martial Emperor strength is also enough.
<br><br>The second weakness is that this body-soul body can only survive for one day.
<br><br>But one day, in Su Xuanjun's opinion, is not much, because one day is enough time for him to get the bottom of the island clearly.
<br><br>"Tsk ......"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun smiled coldly with satisfaction, "I would like to see what kind of people you really are."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>He closed his eyes, and his intention manipulated this divine soul to break through the air and rush towards the small island outside of Pingjiang City in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>On the grass by the lake.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei was wearing a straw hat, crossing his legs, leisurely looking at the dog and milk dose jumping around not far away.
<br><br>At the moment a bear and a dog are cutting each other up.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, ha, hey."
<br><br>"I fight."
<br><br>"I dodge."
<br><br>For a while, a bear and a dog are fighting, you and me.
<br><br>"Come again."
<br><br>"Deh."
<br><br>"Watch me Tiangu steal the peach."
<br><br>At this time, the dog again on the ground a carp, on the crotch towards the milk agent.
<br><br>"Eat my ass."
<br><br>The second milk agent's voice also came out in the next moment, the bear paw pounded the ground, I do not know how many pounds of body flying up, and then sat down towards the dog.
<br><br>At this time, the lake a wind, gently blowing Buddha and up.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun controlled body and soul body, landed on the edge of the lake.
<br><br>With his hands behind his back, he slightly raised his head, and his sharp gaze looked at the island in the distance.
<br><br>"Have we finally arrived?"
<br><br>"This time to come, whether you are dragons or worms, all are under my control."
<br><br>He raised the corners of his mouth leisurely, sneering out a confident voice, and then his body and soul body moved, about to fly towards the island.
<br><br>Suddenly!
<br><br>An abrupt voice came from the side.
<br><br>"Eat my ass ......"
<br><br>The voice came out along with a gust of wind coming.
<br><br>Su Xuanjun frowned.
<br><br>Busy lifting his head to look, his face suddenly changed.
<br><br>A fat bear butt fell from the sky and sat down directly towards him.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Only a vague "boom" was heard, and Su Xuanjun, who was sitting inside the seclusion room, winced and went black before his eyes, unable to see anything.
<br><br>At the same time, the divine soul also lost all contact.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>"Damn it, damn it!"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's face was blue and he cursed furiously.
<br><br>He had lost a drop of blood and spent a lot of money to create such a soul, and he wanted to visit the island properly, but he didn't think that he had just teleported there, and he didn't even move his fucking feet, and then he was sitting on his ass.
<br><br>Really suffocating ah!
<br><br>"Damn bear demon, lowly bear demon, if let me prove that you are not so strong on this island, the first one I kill is you."
<br><br>He clenched his fist to death, and a sound of gnashing teeth came out of his mouth.
<br><br>After calming down for a long time, he went back to the heavenly prison and caught another dead prisoner in the closed room.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>Last time's failure did not dissuade him from continuing to the island.
<br><br>Because the failure last time, in his opinion, was pure bad luck, it happened to pass over when he ran into that one bear and one dog cutting a deal, and happened to be sitting on his ass.
<br><br>Although the face is very black, but he also had to accept such a fact.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>He planned to use the same method, refining another divine soul out, and re-visiting the island.
<br><br>The same old technique was used again.
<br><br>Another dead prisoner died, and with the addition of his contribution of another drop of essence blood as the price, a new body-soul body was sacrificed out by him after ten hours or so.
<br><br>And in order to avoid the situation last time, he deliberately selected a stronger dead prisoner, so that this body and soul body has the strength of the Earth Immortal.
<br><br>So even after encountering that ass, it was not even time to dodge.
<br><br>"This time, I am bound to explore the truth!"
<br><br>"I'm bound to get it!"
<br><br>A confident voice came out, then the mind moved, the body soul body set off again towards the island.
