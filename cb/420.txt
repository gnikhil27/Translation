In the midst of the four sighs, the sharp-eyed Taiyi Valley Patriarch suddenly rubbed up his eyes and stared deadly into the first line of the valley.
<br><br>Seems to have found something incredible.
<br><br>When she nearly burst her eyes, she finally pointed unbelievably at the middle of the First Line Valley and exclaimed, "Look, there's someone."
<br><br>"You're crazy, how can there be someone at this stage?"
<br><br>The Hengtian Sword Saisai Patriarch gave the Taiyi Valley Patriarch a white glance and transmitted a voice that was not good-natured.
<br><br>Although he knew that it was probably because the Taiyi Valley Patriarch saw that the crowd was not in the right mood and wanted to make a joke to liven up the atmosphere, but in his opinion this kind of joke was very out of place.
<br><br>And it wasn't funny at all.
<br><br>"That's right, don't make such jokes, only a fool would believe you." The Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch likewise couldn't help but say, but just after he finished, he also glanced at the middle of the First Line Valley out of the corner of his eyes.
<br><br>The whole person was stunned.
<br><br>"I seem to be really a fool!"
<br><br>He emitted a dull voice. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Seemingly in some disbelief at the scene happening in front of him, he swept up and landed to a place with a better view.
<br><br>And the Taiyi Valley Patriarch also followed in sync with him.
<br><br>The Patriarch of Heng Tian Jian Zhai and the Patriarch of Canghai Mountain, who were left behind, couldn't help but glance at each other.
<br><br>"There can't really be someone, right?"
<br><br>The two coincidentally sounded out their voices, then swept up and also followed in a hurry.
<br><br>The two took a look down the canyon from the top and were similarly frozen in place.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>At the bottom of the valley, there was a human figure walking slowly.
<br><br>"What is he?"
<br><br>The Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch couldn't help but exclaim, "Doesn't he know what lies inside this First Line Valley?"
<br><br>No one from the remaining three could respond to him.
<br><br>Because this was also the doubt in their hearts.
<br><br>"Could it be that he is an expert?"
<br><br>The Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch asked again.
<br><br>"It's still hard to say whether he is an expert or a misguided intruder, but there will be results soon." Taiyi Valley Patriarch said.
<br><br>The rest of the people also nodded similarly.
<br><br>Because this person had just entered the canyon, he hadn't even reached the really dangerous place.
<br><br>"It's just a hundred feet in front of him, right?" The Canghai Mountain Patriarch asked.
<br><br>"Good, it is from there that the poisonous fog spreads, and the last time the four of us tried a dozen times, we all retreated back there." Hengtian Jianzhai Patriarch nodded and said.
<br><br>"Whether it's a mule or a horse, we'll see soon." The Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch said.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads and their pupils focused on the man.
<br><br>It was closer.
<br><br>Closer.
<br><br>Thirty feet.
<br><br>Ten feet.
<br><br>Five feet.
<br><br>Three zhang ......
<br><br>At this moment, the four people's hearts lifted, eyes deadly.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Four people's eyes glazed over, while exclaiming.
<br><br>"Where is the person?"
<br><br>"How can people be missing?"
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>At this moment, under the eyes of the four of them, a bizarre scene had occurred, and the person had suddenly disappeared just now.
<br><br>But soon, the most sharp-eyed Taiyi Valley patriarch found the clues and shouted, "No, he has entered the poisonous fog."
<br><br>Upon hearing that, the remaining three also ran their Yuan Qi and focused their eyes into the poisonous fog.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>In that thick poisonous fog, traces of that man were found.
<br><br>He was walking slowly as usual.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>The four of them instantly drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>How could it be?
<br><br>How was it possible?
<br><br>How did he dare to walk into this level of poisonous fog?
<br><br>The four stared at each other with eyes full of disbelief.
<br><br>You know, the last time they just touched the poisonous fog, they retreated back.
<br><br>Because this kind of poisonous fog even a little bit on the body, must consume a lot of cultivation to get rid of, otherwise, even if the flesh defense like a bronze wall of them, will be visible to the naked eye speed and rot and necrosis.
<br><br>What's more, now someone dares to walk in as a whole, without exerting half a yuan qi to protect the body.
<br><br>Such a tactic is simply unheard of!
<br><br>"It seems that, where he walked, the poisonous fog is dissipating." At this time, the Taiyi Valley Patriarch found something else.
<br><br>The rest of the few people looked and drew a backward breath.
<br><br>Indeed, as the Taiyi Valley Patriarch said, the poisonous fog was dissipating in the places he had walked.
<br><br>For example, where he was, the visibility was less than three feet at the moment.
<br><br>Fifty feet behind him, visibility is already to dozens of feet.
<br><br>And a hundred feet behind him, space has been completely restored to clear, can no longer see half of the poisonous fog blocking.
<br><br>And at this point, something even more incredible played out in the eyes of the four people.
<br><br>The formations in the valley, has been activated.
<br><br>Including various illusion formations, maze formations, killing formations, had all been activated.
<br><br>However, what they didn't expect was that the man faced these formations like a flat ground, and had completely lost its effect on him.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"Who the hell is this person?"
<br><br>"Yes, this murderous One-Line Valley is like an ordinary valley in his eyes, what kind of cultivation level is this to be able to do that!"
<br><br>Four people's hearts set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>"Cut, this valley is just an ordinary valley well, really think there is any danger."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was walking slowly in the valley, couldn't help but spit out.
<br><br>He has been walking for a day, this valley in addition to some fog, he really did not encounter any danger.
<br><br>As for the fog, fog in the canyon is too normal.
<br><br>But the non-pursuit danger, that is not without.
<br><br>To say that also let Yi Feng quite strange, the weather in the snow and ice actually have a small snake to attack him.
<br><br>But by Yi Feng a foot on the trampling dead, but also in the next cliff wall picked a white mushroom as a seasoning, made a pot of hot spray snake soup.
<br><br>After drinking the snake soup rest for a moment, Yi Feng continued to step on the formation.
<br><br>Yi Feng just walked shortly after, four figures followed ......
