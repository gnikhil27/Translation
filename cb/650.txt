Fang scarf a group of people feet in mid-air stepping are going to smoke, finally after a day, arrived outside the West Ning Immortal Continent House.
<br><br>As the saying goes, people are in high spirits when they are happy.
<br><br>Fang Scarf's face was so rosy.
<br><br>With a group of elders, full of smiling faces towards the West Ning Immortal Continent House.
<br><br>A few specialized receptionists politely led the crowd into the meeting room.
<br><br>"Everyone wait a moment, I will immediately go and inform the continent master."
<br><br>"Fine, fine!"
<br><br>Fang Scarf responded politely, and after the people left, he couldn't help but sit down on that big chair and said with a joyful face after patting it, "Look, look, the continental lord's house is the continental lord's house, the wood of this chair is not an ordinary product."
<br><br>"Yes, this time our Dahua clan can be considered to be on the top of life."
<br><br>"Usually, which sect would be treated so politely by the continental lord house!"
<br><br>"That's right, it seems that the continental lord is also a man of nature, who appreciates those who know the times." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Haha ......"
<br><br>A cadre of elders discussed enthusiastically.
<br><br>"Huh!"
<br><br>Just at this moment, one of the elders seemed to see something through the door and couldn't help but give a light eek.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf and the others asked.
<br><br>"Look at that person crouching on the ground, does he look like Lu Chong?"
<br><br>That elder wiped his eyes and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The crowd also couldn't help but look at it, and they were astonished.
<br><br>"It seems like it's really Lu Chong?"
<br><br>"How come he's here, shouldn't he be in Shadow Island?"
<br><br>"That's right, this is the City Lord's Mansion, how can he be here!"
<br><br>The crowd was full of disbelief.
<br><br>"Let's go, go over and take a look, don't let the Heaven's Immortal Hall catch the wrong person and let this real culprit get away with it."ã€€One of the elders couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Don't, he's inside the city lord's residence after all, what if he's a guest on the continental lord's residence?" Another elder asked.
<br><br>"What are you thinking?"
<br><br>"With that waste kid Lu Chong, would he be a guest of the Continent Lord's House?" The elder said disdainfully, "And look at him, squatting on the floor brushing a bucket of dung, at best, he's just a maid in the Island Lord's house."
<br><br>"But it doesn't make sense, Lu Chong should be locked up in Shadow Island, how could he come here to do odd jobs?"
<br><br>"So that's what's fishy." The elder said: "I now have the possibility to suspect that the father and son Lu Chong in order to avoid the Shadow Island, looking for someone to take the blame."
<br><br>"How can that be?"
<br><br>"This is deceiving the continental lord's house and the Heaven's Immortal Palace."
<br><br>"Yes, if this really holds true, then our Great Harmony Sect will be implicated."
<br><br>The crowd couldn't help but get angry.
<br><br>"Let's go, go over and take a look."
<br><br>Fang Scarf organized his thoughts and agreed with that elder's words.
<br><br>Otherwise, he really couldn't figure out why Lu Chong would appear here.
<br><br>If this was really the case, then he had to do something, don't lose the mining rights of the mineral crystal that had come to hand because of this Lu Chong.
<br><br>A group of people aggressively forced towards Lu Chong.
<br><br>These two days.
<br><br>In Li Hongtian's strong request, Lu Chong two people only here for a small stay two people, but also just take this time to stabilize the two just breakthrough cultivation.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>To the point Lu Chong will not forget their business.
<br><br>So he took advantage of the sunlight to start wiping the dung bucket, immersed in it.
<br><br>"Lu Chong, it's really you?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf and others came around and saw Lu Chong's proper face was considered to be confirmed.
<br><br>"It's actually you guys?"
<br><br>Lu Chong's eyes were raised.
<br><br>The face instantly pulled crotch down.
<br><br>Because of the matter of burning the Heaven's Immortal Hall, this group of people's suppression of his father, as well as the expulsion of him from the Great Harmony Sect he had already known about it.
<br><br>"Good boy, I didn't expect it was really you, let me ask you, didn't you go to the Dark Shadow Island, how come you are here?" Fang Scarf directly opened his mouth to force the question.
<br><br>"What does it matter to you where I am?"
<br><br>Lu Chong did not want to say anything to this group of people, holding the bucket of dung in his hands to change places.
<br><br>But as soon as he got up, the crowd surrounded him, cutting off his way back.
<br><br>"Lu Chong, even though you have been expelled from the Great Harmony Sect, I am still able to ask you something." Fang Scarf once again pressed on, "I ask you, why are you here?"
<br><br>Lu Chong frowned slightly and said in a deep voice, "No comment, please move aside."
<br><br>"No comment?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf sneered, not meaning to let go at all, "If I guessed correctly, it was you and Lu Zun who thought of a way to find someone to take the place of someone else during the arrest of the Heaven's Immortal Hall, right?"
<br><br>"Caught the fake one in, and you, the real one, ran to the City Lord's Palace to be a hired hand?"
<br><br>"Really good tactics ah, this hand transferring flowers is really a good scheme ah, after all, who would have thought that you hide in the city master's residence?"
<br><br>"If we hadn't met you here, I'm afraid everyone would have been fooled by you, right?"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Fang Scarf pointed at Lu Chong even more viciously.
<br><br>"You really are so vicious!"
<br><br>"Do you know that you are going to harm our Great Harmony Sect like this."
<br><br>"Do you think that you didn't harm our Great Harmony Sect enough before?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf had an angry face.
<br><br>In particular, his heart was apprehensive, in case the continental lord came and knew about this matter, would he still give the crystal mining rights to his Great Harmony Sect.
<br><br>And outside the courtyard wall.
<br><br>Li Hongtian is lying on the courtyard wall.
<br><br>Anxiously jumping to his feet.
<br><br>What to do, what to do?
<br><br>He was so anxious that he was about to cry.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>He has been here for a while.
<br><br>But just walked to the courtyard wall, and heard the conversation between the Fang Scarf and Lu Chong.
<br><br>Now he learned from the conversation.
<br><br>Lu Chong had long been expelled from the Great Harmony Sect because of the fire burning of the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>Yet he Li Hongtian still politely invited Fang Scarf and others to come and discuss the matter of crystal mines ......
<br><br>This oolong, simply a big mess.
<br><br>Pop!
<br><br>He heavily slapped himself a big mouth.
<br><br>A face of remorse.
<br><br>Regret that he did not investigate clearly as early as possible.
<br><br>Originally, he wanted to ingratiate himself with Lu Chong through the Great Harmony Sect, but he knew that he had smashed his own feet by lifting a stone.
<br><br>In the past two days, it was easy to make good relations with Lu Chong, if it was not handled well, it would be a foregone conclusion.
<br><br>Even more, Lu Chong, in a fit of anger, will be the pair of dung buckets towards him covered.
<br><br>Think of all the cold sweat dripping!
<br><br>So he didn't think of countermeasures, he simply did not dare to go out for a while.
<br><br>"Are you deaf?"
<br><br>"This Sovereign is asking you."
<br><br>Fang Scarf drank with a gloomy face.
<br><br>Lu Chong's face was gloomy.
<br><br>His heart was full of cold frost.
<br><br>It could be said that at this moment, the last trace of his feelings for the Great Harmonization Sect had dissipated.
<br><br>"I want to know, who, wanted you to come here?"
<br><br>Lu Chong asked in an icy voice.
<br><br>"Why are you asking this?"
<br><br>Fang Scarf glanced at Lu Chong, then said with an arrogant face, "Of course there's no harm in telling you, we came here, naturally the Lord of Xining Continent invited us here!"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It was fine if he didn't say this.
<br><br>Once said.
<br><br>Outside Li Hongtian could not hide anymore, and directly kicked towards Fang Scarf.
<br><br>At the same time, he cursed viciously, "Put your mother's fart, when did I ask you to come here?"
