The sword mane is getting closer and closer.
<br><br>Before it fully fell, the death aura alone already filled the hearts of two people.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>However, just at this moment, night Yi's waist, suddenly burst out a dazzling light.
<br><br>The light swept out.
<br><br>Almost instantly, it bounced Bai Shanyi's sword away.
<br><br>Long sword out of hand, white shallow one in mid-air rolled back, looking at the cracked tiger mouth, full of incredulity.
<br><br>Of course, the hair cracked tiger mouth is not enough to attract her full attention, but to look at the volume from the waist of the night Yi off, and then slowly rise up in the air and the scroll.
<br><br>And the two people who thought they were bound to die, Night Energy, also reacted and looked in shock at the scroll that slowly floated up.
<br><br>Under the gaze of the crowd, the scroll slowly spread out in mid-air under the illumination of light.
<br><br>"Painting!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yi'er, look, it's the painting that Mr. gave you!"
<br><br>Night Energy shouted with trembling voice in excitement.
<br><br>"Yes father, it's the painting that sir gave me, it's the painting that sir gave me showing his power."
<br><br>Night Yi similarly left tears of excitement and shouted, "So Mr. never misses the mark, he predicted everything that followed long ago."
<br><br>"Yes, sir definitely predicted all of this."
<br><br>Night can excitedly pick up the cadence, face full of admiration, "I said why sir gave you a painting for a good reason, it turns out to be so."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi was covered with a chilling aura and tightly frowned.
<br><br>Because she felt an absolute threat on top of this painting, a threat that was even more terrifying than the appearance of the man in the auspicious clouds and black robes.
<br><br>However, she was not willing to admit this threat.
<br><br>After all, in her eyes, this outside world, which had only 20 million years of inheritance, was just a poor countryside place compared to the Lingxu Realm, which had several eras of inheritance.
<br><br>These country people, in front of her, as honored as the Goddess of Baiyang True Palace, could only be slaves.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>A wooden sculpture was enough to make her unexpected and even unacceptable.
<br><br>How could she be willing to accept, again and again, the appearance of something in this countryside place that made him, Bai Shanyi, feel intimidated?
<br><br>Her identity.
<br><br>Her pride, not allowed to make her feel intimidated.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The scroll was completely spread out in mid-air and a woman presented herself.
<br><br>She was pavilioned, dragging her chin to sit at the end, full of fresh beauty.
<br><br>"It's you?"
<br><br>Bai Shouyi recognized the woman in the scroll as Night Yi with a single glance, and the wary look on her face was instantly swept away.
<br><br>This woman is just a waste in itself, let alone in the painting scroll?
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The threat just now was an illusion.
<br><br>A cold smile sprang up on her face.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>She then realized that her thoughts were ridiculously wrong.
<br><br>The woman in the painting, as if alive, the head will be the eyes, fixed on the body of Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>And the eyes, also seems to have a vague energy in the containment.
<br><br>For some reason, this gaze makes Bai Shanyi feel numb, the cold smile on his face instantly frozen.
<br><br>Before she could slow down, two columns of white light shot straight out from the eyes of the woman in the painting, forcing it towards Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>Where the pillars of light passed, space directly evaporated into nothingness, rippling a circle.
<br><br>The unprecedented sense of crisis and fear, filled the heart of the white shallow one.
<br><br>Let her heart and soul tremble, cold sweat.
<br><br>Rao is proud of her, in this instant the heart of the first idea is to run.
<br><br>Because she strongly felt, if the two light pillars attacked, she will only end up in a fall.
<br><br>The body of the immortal power in the body surging, white shallow a foot on the void, desperately flying towards the far sky.
<br><br>While escaping, while breathing sharply, when she looked back behind her, her eyes widened in horror.
<br><br>The pillar of light.
<br><br>It had already reached behind her.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>She crumbled and shouted, letting out a shrill scream as her body tried desperately to dodge.
<br><br>But it was all just useless.
<br><br>The two pillars of light directly penetrated her body, directly turning into a rain of blood and bursting in mid-air.
<br><br>There are no bones left.
<br><br>Only the air still vaguely echoes her screams.
<br><br>The night energy and the four patriarchs who saw this scene the whole time also felt their scalps tingle.
<br><br>The power of those two pillars of light was too terrifying!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The light of that scroll did not diminish, and the gaze of Night Yi in that painting moved again.
<br><br>With this movement, two more pillars of light shot out towards the distant sky.
<br><br>More than a dozen miles away, the void shakes, white shallow a face full of fear out, forehead dripping with cold sweat sitting paralyzed on the ground.
<br><br>That sense of crisis of death, is too terrifying.
<br><br>She could never have imagined that she, the divine daughter of the White Sun True Palace in the Lingxu Realm, would actually die twice in the same day in this poor and remote place.
<br><br>This also meant that two of the three marks on her arm had already been dulled.
<br><br>But she had just taken a breath when the sense of crisis reappeared.
<br><br>She looked back and instantly found two more pillars of light shooting up from the far sky, directly locking onto her.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Don't."
<br><br>"I was wrong, I was wrong, please, don't kill me."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi eyes filled with extreme fear, staring at the place where the light pillars were shooting from, emitting a general voice of supplication.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The pillar of light did not stop for half a second because of her begging.
<br><br>Snort!
<br><br>Pillar of light.
<br><br>Once again, it pierced through her body.
<br><br>Her newly resurrected life had already gone up in smoke before she even had the chance to move her feet.
<br><br>Another place ten miles away.
<br><br>Bai Shanyi once again walked out from space.
<br><br>She came out with a look full of fear, breathing heavily at the same time, she did not dare to have the slightest stop to flee in the distance.
<br><br>Because all the marks on her arm had disappeared.
<br><br>If she died again, it would mean that her life, Bai Shanyi, had completely come to an end.
<br><br>As she ran hurriedly, she looked back behind her.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>In the space behind her.
<br><br>There were two faint flashes of light shining from behind.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Bai Shanyi was almost scared out of her mind, trembling palms pulled out a golden scroll from the storage ring and threw it out.
<br><br>The scroll light flashed, causing a black teleportation array to appear above her head.
<br><br>This teleportation scroll was able to instantly transport her back to Baiyang True Palace.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Just a little distance from the teleportation array, but also let her feel like a heavenly ditch, because that once again shot the pillar of light, has broken through the air.
<br><br>Despair filled Bai Shanyi's heart.
<br><br>She desperately stepped forward into the air, while hysterical sounds came out of her mouth hysterically.
<br><br>"Save me, old ancestor, master, patriarch, elders, save me ...... please, save me ......"
<br><br>Feeling the increasingly intense crisis behind her, she eagerly looked at the teleportation array, the appearance to be more wretched will be more wretched.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A figure appeared from the teleportation array.
<br><br>It was an old man in his sixties.
<br><br>He was immortal, holding a duster in his hand, and emitting a powerful aura.
<br><br>"Elder Yun, save me quickly."
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, Bai Shanyi was like grabbing a life-saving straw and shouted in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>"Goddess don't be afraid, old man is here, no one can hurt you."
<br><br>Elder Yun's face was frozen, and immediately stepped out from the teleportation formation with a step, and his voice, mixed with the power of immortality, shook the air.
<br><br>"White Sun True Palace Yun Heavenly Elder is here, who dares to hurt my True Palace Goddess?"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, two pillars of light directly pierced through his body.
