Yun Yaoyao also snapped her gaze over.
<br><br>"It's not much."
<br><br>Yi Feng turned the ring of space on his finger and said with a smile on his face, "If I eat normally, three people will only have the amount of twenty years, and if I eat once every few days like before, I can probably eat until I die of old age."
<br><br>For Yi Feng has the ring of space, they have long known, although do not know where Yi Feng a mortal came from, but this kind of thing, generally cultivators will keep a tacit understanding not to ask more.
<br><br>But when they heard Yi Feng's sentence that he could eat until he died of old age, the two almost chopped Yi Feng's heart.
<br><br>"You you you, you have so much food, then you do not take out earlier, almost starved us to death before you take out a little?" Lone Wunian immediately asked in a good-natured manner.
<br><br>"Isn't this preparedness?"
<br><br>Yi Feng white glance at him, said in a good-natured way: "In case really blocked can not get out, I can also die of old age inside, although it is suffocating a little, but good death is better than living well."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Stop it."
<br><br>The blue-faced Lone Wunian looked at Yi Feng's appearance, really angry and laugh, and finally grabbed a pile of beef jerky from Yi Feng's hand and wolfed it down. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I really don't know where you get so much to eat."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao shook her head and asked without good grace.
<br><br>"This is not when I left Nansha, I asked an old brother of mine to help me get some specialties, and he prepared this much for me." Yi Feng explained with a smile, "But speaking of which, this old brother of mine is really too polite, afraid that I won't have enough to eat."
<br><br>The two people were speechless.
<br><br>No longer wanted to listen to Yi Feng anymore.
<br><br>This meal.
<br><br>The three people ate extraordinarily full.
<br><br>And after knowing that Yi Feng reserves a large amount, the two people are a little hungry, looking for Yi Feng to eat.
<br><br>Finally also in three days later, the three out of the immortal ruins.
<br><br>See the daylight again.
<br><br>"Phew, didn't think that after walking out of the immortal ruins, it was already to the edge of the hundred thousand mountains." Lone Wunian lamented.
<br><br>"Yes, it's not far from Pingjiang City." Yi Feng likewise sighed.
<br><br>"This feeling of surviving after a robbery is so good!"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao took a deep breath and gently closed her beautiful eyes, feeling everything around her.
<br><br>The three of them did not delay much and continued to hurry.
<br><br>About half a day later, the three of them also got out of the range of the descending dimensional pressure, and both Lone Wunian and Yun Yoyao's cultivation level returned.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, I never thought you were really a mortal, I was a bit unconvinced before." Lone Wunian looked up and down at Yi Feng and said incredulously.
<br><br>"How can I lie to you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave Lone Wunian a white glance without good grace.
<br><br>"To be honest, Brother Yi, I have never admired many people in my life, and mortals have never had one, you are the first."
<br><br>"I also have to admit that this time if it wasn't for you, I'm afraid that I, Lone Wunian, would have been planted in this immortal ruin."
<br><br>"Thanks."
<br><br>Lone Wunian bowed gently towards Yi Feng, extremely sincere.
<br><br>To know, to be able to make a high-minded martial emperor perform this kind of bow to a mortal with a happy heart was enough to show the status of Yi Feng in Lone Wunian's eyes.
<br><br>"What's there to thank or not to thank."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"Inside the cave, you guys ate so many things from me, shouldn't we settle a score?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Lone Wunian was frozen in place.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's pretty face also turned dark with the naked eye.
<br><br>This girl.
<br><br>Why is he so unbeatable.
<br><br>Just a little gratitude for him, immediately began to talk about money.
<br><br>"Well, you guys wait a minute, I'll do some calculations."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng squatted on the ground and used a stick to calculate.
<br><br>"Okay okay don't calculate, I'll give you another million gold coins." Yun Yaoyao said in a good-natured manner.
<br><br>"Ya, rich woman, rich woman ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng had a face of excitement.
<br><br>Saying that, he looked at Lone Wunian again and said with a smile, "So Brother Wunian, what about you?"
<br><br>"Ahem, I thought it was something, it turned out to be gold coins, it just so happens that I still have some saved up there, about three to five million, I'll give it all to you later." Lone Wunian said atmospherically.
<br><br>"Aha, so you're the real tycoon."
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately gave Lone Wunian a big bear hug.
<br><br>"Well Brother Yi, I need to go back to Dongsheng first, when I'm done with the matter at hand, I'll come to you and bring you the money by the way." Lone Wunian said.
<br><br>"Good good, take your time, you are always welcome to come."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Good bye Miss Yun."
<br><br>Lone Wunian clasped his fist towards the two and swept up into the air, disappearing towards the far sky.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Looking at the leaving Lone Wunian, Yi Feng sighed and said leisurely, "Look, what is called pattern, Brother Wunian is called pattern, at a glance is the person who does great things."
<br><br>Yi Feng this meaningful words, immediately let Yun Yoyao mouth corner twitch animal.
<br><br>But could not help but laugh again.
<br><br>"What are you laughing at?" Yi Feng puzzled.
<br><br>"I'm laughing, you mortal, quite cute." Yun Yaoyao raised her red lips and said leisurely.
<br><br>"Nani ？？？？？"
<br><br>Yi Feng had a black line on his face.
<br><br>"Forget it, let's take you out of the mountain first!"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo grabbed Yi Feng's palm and swept up into the air.
<br><br>Soon after, he had left the 100,000 Great Mountains and arrived outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"I also need to go back to Dongsheng something, I'm afraid I can only send you here."
<br><br>After landing on the ground, Yun Yoyo said softly.
<br><br>"Okay, then you go slowly, I also haven't gone back for a long time, it's time to go back."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded towards Yun Yoyo.
<br><br>After saying goodbye, Yi Feng walked straight back towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back after he left, he never looked back, Yun Yao Yao opened his mouth, but the words in his mouth finally did not come out.
<br><br>After all, not all the way people.
<br><br>Sigh.
<br><br>She sighed, then wanted to turn back and leave.
<br><br>But when she turned back, she found that Yi Feng, who had left, had suddenly turned back.
<br><br>Her eyes lit up, and she hurriedly stopped her departing body.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Her pupils shone with light, her pretty face revealed an unconcealed joy, and her heart rose with anticipation.
<br><br>"Big sister, don't forget to return my money." Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Caught unawares, Yun Yoyao's chest tightened and almost attacked her heart with anger.
<br><br>Killing intent rose from her circumference, the surrounding temperature also wrinkled up, the ground where her feet stepped quietly cracked out countless cracks ......
