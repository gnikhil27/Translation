"You ......"
<br><br>"Liu Yan, you don't want to bully people too much?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie's face was dark, gritting his teeth and drinking word by word.
<br><br>"We are not bullying too much, I am just thinking of you!" Yi Feng walked out and raised the corner of his mouth and said, "After all, you just swore by the heavenly dao, if you don't keep your promise, it's you who will be punished by the heavenly dao."
<br><br>"We reminded you of a good intention, and you still want to blame us?"
<br><br>"Forget it, just don't fulfill it, we don't want it."
<br><br>Yi Feng said lazily, nodded towards Liu Yan to leave.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Guo Shijie was so angry that he spat out a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>His scarlet eyes were red, his teeth clacked, and he looked at Yi Feng with a face full of hatred.
<br><br>Not to mention that he had sworn, even if he didn't, in front of so many people, if he didn't fulfill his promise, he had almost lost face. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And seeing Guo Shijie like this, the Star Peak crowd, including Liu Yan, can not mention how happy.
<br><br>Thinking about the day of the new disciples' initiation, Yi Feng's move can be described as returning the favor to his people.
<br><br>How many years, has been pressed by the sun and moon peak, now this moment is really fucking raised eyebrows.
<br><br>This human immortal disciple, but the more you see, the better ah!
<br><br>The way Guo Shijie has not been fulfilling his promise also immediately made the other people around start talking.
<br><br>"Is Sun Moon Peak unable to afford to lose?"
<br><br>"Yes, it's obvious that they've lost, why are they still struggling?"
<br><br>These words caused Guo Shijie's face to grow darker and darker.
<br><br>"Buzz!"
<br><br>A sword sounded, and the intermediate level immortal weapon in his hand stuck to the ground.
<br><br>"I, Sun Moon Peak, am trash, alright?"
<br><br>He spoke out with a hideous face and gave Yi Feng a hateful look.
<br><br>After saying that, with extreme speed, he quickly left the place.
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>Seeing this appearance of Guo Shijie, who had lost his face and fled in a mess, the crowd of Star Peak all laughed out loud.
<br><br>Great.
<br><br>It's cool to see Guo Shijie defeated!
<br><br>"Haha, little friend, I'm the elder in charge of daily things at our Star Peak, come and sit at my place more often in the future."
<br><br>"Little friend, you are so impressive to us, you are the first human immortal I admire in my life."
<br><br>"Little friend drink, nothing to drink at my place ......"
<br><br>A time, the various elders of the Star Peak, as well as other disciples, have come up to tie the deal Feng.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng happy mouth.
<br><br>Now, can finally experience the feeling of the stars holding the moon.
<br><br>This is not the same as before.
<br><br>In the past, in Pingjiang City, the old man and woman surrounded by the group, what is the point?
<br><br>You show them some strength, they are still shocked, a group of old things with delayed nerves.
<br><br>"All right, all right, you guys go back first."
<br><br>At this time, Liu Yan came over and said.
<br><br>Hearing this, the excited crowd then dispersed one by one.
<br><br>But even though Liu Yan said so, her heart could not be calm as usual.
<br><br>I have to say, this guy in front of her really impressed her ah.
<br><br>The first time I saw him, I was able to get him to the end of his life.
<br><br>In the past, she did not even dare to think about it.
<br><br>"Say, what do you want?" Liu Yan said softly.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and was a bit confused because he felt that for the time being, he didn't know what he needed.
<br><br>"Can I give it later?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"OK!"
<br><br>Liu Yan agreed and was even more impressed with Yi Feng.
<br><br>If other disciples had this kind of opportunity, I'm afraid they would have been eager to say it long ago, but this guy is not anxious to talk about it later.
<br><br>Really different from ordinary people ah.
<br><br>"However, you have made Guo Shijie suffer such a big loss today, he is afraid that he will not rest in peace, and may even secretly strike at you, so you must be careful." Liu Yan reminded again.
<br><br>"Just a Reincarnation Immortal realm trash, I'm not afraid." Yi Feng waved his hand indifferently.
<br><br>This caused Liu Yan's face to twitch slightly.
<br><br>This Human Immortal, what makes him not afraid of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm?
<br><br>Of course, she still added, saying, "As I told you last time, he is a Ninth Turn Xuan Xian, not a Reincarnation Immortal Realm as you said."
<br><br>"Oh, misremembered, but it's just more garbage, high regard for him." Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>This finally made Liu Yan couldn't help himself and asked, "Where on earth did you get the strength to not be afraid of him? Not afraid of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm?"
<br><br>"Secret."
<br><br>Yi Feng said vaguely.
<br><br>"Secret?"
<br><br>Liu Yan giggled.
<br><br>This little guy in front of her, if he really had any secrets, could she not see it?
<br><br>This guy.
<br><br>Everything is good.
<br><br>Just a little bragging.
<br><br>The good thing is, there is not a big problem.
<br><br>"By the way, tell you one more thing." Liu Yan said.
<br><br>"Please tell me."
<br><br>"In seven days, there will be a new student competition, and you will all have to participate."
<br><br>"Freshman competition?"
<br><br>"A ring tournament?"
<br><br>"No." Liu Yan shook his head and said, "According to the past rules, you should be put into the back mountain and ranked by the number of demonic beasts you hunt."
<br><br>"But you should not underestimate it."
<br><br>"There are countless demon beasts in the back mountain, both high and low, with your strength, you can only hunt some low-level demon beasts, which is equivalent to saying that while you hunt low-level demon beasts, you also have to prevent attacks from high-level demon beasts."
<br><br>"Of course, the most important rule is that between disciples, they can snatch each other ......"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>He kind of heard it.
<br><br>This big competition, what really matters is the snatching between disciples.
<br><br>Disciples with strong strength can even not hunt demon beasts, just snatching low strength disciples, and be able to get a good ranking.
<br><br>How cruel the competition will be at that time can be imagined.
<br><br>"How many people are participating?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Just what you saw last time, about four or five thousand people, except for you, a human immortal, the lowest are earth immortals." Liu Yan looked at Yi Feng and said leisurely.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng's face dark.
<br><br>What's wrong with human immortals?
<br><br>At the same time the heart committed a small muttering.
<br><br>Can the group of old men in the back garden, bring it over to help him.
<br><br>"Anyway, this time I will give you a task, if you can get the top 500, I can promise you another request." Liu Yan said.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng promised.
<br><br>Who cares what happens then, first agree to it, anyway, one more chance of this kind of request is one.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Liu Yan gazed at him for a long time and did not leave.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>She let out a long sigh.
<br><br>"This kid, in a single ye will cultivate the One Thought Finger to perfection, simply unheard of, unseen, shows his comprehension of cultivating immortal techniques, against the sky!"
<br><br>"Unfortunately, I just looked at his roots and bones, has long been set, this age to be a human immortal, has been destined to the upper limit ah!"
<br><br>"It's a pity indeed."
<br><br>"But if he has a Heavenly Immortal cultivation now, his future achievements, I'm afraid, can surpass the entire Sun Moon Sect."
<br><br>Behind her, a Star Peak elder stepped out and sighed similarly, after all, cultivating immortal techniques quickly doesn't exactly mean having the same talent in cultivation.
<br><br>"Maybe it's because of the origin!"
<br><br>"It's all fate."
<br><br>"However, it is still possible to cultivate a little, in the future as a Star Peak elder, perhaps there is still a chance." Liu Yan said: "That's why I motivated him, to get a top 500."
<br><br>"But peak master, this top five hundred requirement, is not too high."
<br><br>The elder behind him said: "Four or five thousand disciples, he is the only one with the lowest human immortal, although he cultivated the One Thought finger, but it can not make up for the difference in cultivation, I think it is good to get a top three thousand, right?"
<br><br>"Five hundred is also just my casual goal, and did not really think he could get, as you said, there is a top three thousand, it is not bad ......"
