In a dark and gloomy water cave, a huge centipede crawled along the rock wall toward the water cave.
<br><br>And in the middle of the water cave, there was an old king centipede lying on its back!
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, Lord Demon Emperor, it's bad." The centipede shouted anxiously, "Just now a human came to snatch the Heavenly Heart Tantalum, and also a shovel shot Lord Black Feather to death, and I, too, paid the price of two broken feet to run back to report to Lord Demon Emperor ah!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Hearing that, that lazy lying old king of the eight suddenly stood up, the calm water surface suddenly turned up shocking waves, rippling tens of feet high water splash.
<br><br>"You said someone robbed my Heavenly Heart Tantalum? Who is it, who exactly is it?"
<br><br>"I don't know who it is, I only know it's a human, and he's still at the Heavenly Heart Tantalum." The centipede said hurriedly.
<br><br>"Go, take me to find him, I must kill this damn human."
<br><br>The old king emitted a monstrous anger, quickly turned into a stream of light, then disappeared, and the centipede hurriedly followed.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"It seems that the map shows that there is a water cave here, and I don't know if there are water spirit grasses inside." Yi Feng came to a stream, it seems there is a rock cave not far away to walk into that water cave.
<br><br>Following the stream, Yi Feng went all the way up and finally found the entrance to that water cave and walked in with it.
<br><br>The water cave.
<br><br>A gloomy, hands can not see five fingers, pitch black, only feel the rock wall above many small drops of water dropping down, fell on Yi Feng shoulders, bringing a chill.
<br><br>Yi Feng shivered and touched the flame beads out of his arms.
<br><br>Once the flame bead came out, it immediately illuminated the entire water cave, and at the same time brought a warm feeling to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Just looking inside the cave, Yi Feng was surprised to see the water spirit grass.
<br><br>"It's really lucky, but it's growing quite tall, so I guess it will take some effort!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, put down the bamboo basket on his back, then took a small shovel and climbed towards the water spirit grass.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"You tell me, where is the human?"
<br><br>And at this time, the old Wang Ba and centipede also rushed to Tianxin Tan here, Tianxin Tan has long gone, the cliff wall next to the smashed black feather corpse, can no longer see other things.
<br><br>"I I I, demon ...... demon emperor Lord, just when I left, he was still here ah!" The centipede said in an anxious tone.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Damn, a little human actually stepped on my bogu's head!"
<br><br>In anger, accompanied by a burst of light, the old wangbao directly transformed into an old man with a tortoise shell on his back, only he looked hideous and his features were huddled together, giving people a sense of fear just by this look.
<br><br>"Where are the eighteen demon kings?"
<br><br>And with his bellow, around the Bo Gu old king eight circumference air, suddenly set off a demon wind burst.
<br><br>Then, a man with a leopard's head stepped in the air.
<br><br>Immediately after the leopard, demon monkeys, demon pigs, demon wolves, demon eagles and other eighteen demon kings all arrived and knelt in front of Bo Gu's body.
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, I wonder what is the important matter you summoned us for?"
<br><br>The eighteen demon kings asked in one voice.
<br><br>Bo Gu's face was gloomy as he sullenly bellowed, "A human has come to the mountain, not only did he pick my Heavenly Heart Tantalum, but he also slapped Black Feather to death, I want you to find this human's trail within half an hour, capture him and bring him to me, I want to thirst for his flesh and blood."
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Demon Emperor!"
<br><br>With a command, the eighteen demon kings turned into demon wind and disappeared far away.
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, don't be angry, this Shifu Mountain is our territory, he won't get far."
<br><br>The centipede piled up this smile, with the demon qi a reveal, also suddenly transformed into a human centipede head, except that his many hands and feet characteristics are still there, said in a flattering manner: "Lord demon emperor you wait here, the small hammered shoulder with you!"
<br><br>Saying that, that countless earth palms perfectly cooperate, help Bo Gu knead up.
<br><br>"Hmph, that's all you waste can do, otherwise I would have taken you and fed you to the Eagle King just for the matter of losing the Heavenly Heart Tantalum." Bo Gu coldly snorted.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>Centipede pinched a sweat, more hard work.
<br><br>Half an hour soon passed, the eighteen demon kings returned to Bo Gu on time, but they all had a grave look on their faces, kneeling on the ground and whispered: "Report to the demon emperor, search the entire mountain, and found no trace of the human."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Bo Gu fiercely stood up, the thick aura directly behind the centipede vibrated away, gloomy eyes stared at the eighteen demon kings, so that they did not dare to breathe a breath.
<br><br>"Pass my order, enlarge the search area, we must find this damn human." Bo Gu said through gritted teeth.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The eighteen demon kings disappeared once again.
<br><br>"Lord Demon Emperor, what about us?" The centipede re-crawled back and asked carefully.
<br><br>"This damned human dares to steal my Heavenly Heart Tantra, I will definitely let him die a good death." Bo Gu said gloomily, "But this Emperor's breakthrough is imminent, the Water Spirit Grass can't have any more accidents, go back to the cave with this Emperor first, when this Emperor finishes absorbing the Water Spirit Grass, then come back to deal with this damn human personally!"
