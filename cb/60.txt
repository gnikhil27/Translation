The body hit the ground heavily, Ning Xuanwu mouth spit out a mouthful of blood, but did not care about the injuries on his body, his body swept away and ran.
<br><br>He was really afraid of being pulled back again, he just wanted to get far away from this martial arts school.
<br><br>After all, the pressure brought to him by these four old men was too terrifying.
<br><br>Of course, the most terrifying thing was the mysterious youth!
<br><br>Although he does not reveal himself, but often this kind of imperceptible feeling of not being able to guess and feel, is the most unbearable.
<br><br>And this trip.
<br><br>He really is a blood loss!
<br><br>What for the net no dust net no wind revenge ah, get back the shock stone swift cloak ah these are not to mention, the mother's little life are almost lost, the key is the entire Xuanwu Sect's resources are also taken away.
<br><br>The most hateful thing is ......
<br><br>He took a look at the black fog that filled his right arm, and for a while he wanted to die.
<br><br>This arm was cut off by Lu Qingshan some time ago, before coming to Pingjiang City he used the secret method of the sect, used a lot of resources, and even used up part of his life span, before he could easily make this arm broken bones to regenerate ...... one second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But who the hell knows, run here what did not do, just fucking killed a mosquito, and suffered such destruction.
<br><br>"Well!"
<br><br>When he thought of this, he simply heart nest pain.
<br><br>But life is important, Sun Zhuge's Heavenly Death poison is not something unusual, this arm if he does not cut down, less than three days he will die a violent death.
<br><br>After struggling for most of the day, he finally gritted his teeth and cut off his arm with a face full of reluctance.
<br><br>Looking at the arm that fell to the ground, Ning Xuanwu was more and more angry the more he thought about it, and the more he thought about it, his body turned into a residual shadow and swept towards the direction where Demon Ling'er and the others were.
<br><br>"Sifu."
<br><br>"Sovereign."
<br><br>The crowd hurriedly greeted over, looking at Ning Xuanwu's missing arm, their faces filled with gloom and complexity.
<br><br>"Where is Xu Kun?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu stormed out.
<br><br>"Zong ...... Zong Zong master, misunderstanding ah!" Xu Kun hid behind Demon Ling'er, his body shivering with a face full of grievance, explained.
<br><br>"Misunderstanding?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu gritted his teeth, directly arm outstretched, directly grabbed Xu Kun's neck twisted in his hand.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Under extreme anger, Ning Xuanwu, without saying a word, directly snapped Xu Kun's neck, and then directly threw it on the ground.
<br><br>"I let you misunderstand, I let you misunderstand!"
<br><br>As if killing Xu Kuan was not enough to relieve his anger, Ning Xuanwu stepped on Xu Kun's corpse again and again, and under his absolute power, the corpse was all trampled into mush.
<br><br>Looking at Ning Xuanwu's fury, the Demon Ling'er and others next to him all lowered their heads, not daring to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>But also, anyone who encountered this kind of thing is afraid that not much better, not to mention Ning Xuanwu is usually high above the Xuanwu Sect Patriarch.
<br><br>"Sovereign, then what to do next?"
<br><br>A long time, see Ning Xuanwu anger seems to have dissipated a little, an elder only slightly raised his chin and asked: "next still continue to revenge?"
<br><br>Once he heard the word revenge, Ning Xuanwu's expression drew straight, and his face was so gloomy that water could come out.
<br><br>"And the Heaven-shaking Stone and Swift Cloak, do you still want to continue to get them back?" That elder asked again.
<br><br>When the others saw this, they instantly cast a pitying look at him.
<br><br>This girl.
<br><br>This is really which pot is not to mention which pot.
<br><br>Sure enough, Ning Xuanwu just calmed down the anger again directly to the brain, a slap over directly slapped this elder into mush.
<br><br>"I let you push, let you push."
<br><br>After a slap, and then the elder's corpse a ruthless beating, and only then let go.
<br><br>PS: Sorry for the small amount of work today, five chapters tomorrow to compensate.
