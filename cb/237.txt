"Grass!"
<br><br>"Ginger is still old and spicy!"
<br><br>Seeing this appearance of old man Wang, Wu Yonghong and Pork Rong and other people's eyes fell straight.
<br><br>In the next moment, Pork Rong did not say a word, his legs were clamped, his teeth pouted and bit his lower lip, and his hands clutched the corner of his coat.
<br><br>Hold out a look of fear, mouth screaming out: "I, I'm so scared, ah, help, I'm just a mortal, why do you guys do this to me, you do not sauce to me ah!"
<br><br>"Not bad for someone who has lived around Mr. for so long, we still have progress to make ah!" Wu Yonghong looked at the old king's head and pork rong, the sound of a sigh, then waving a knife to start running.
<br><br>"Help, I can not beat ah, come to my rescue ah!"
<br><br>While running, but also fell headlong on the ground, the fart rolled.
<br><br>Looking around, in addition to Pork Rong and Old Wang Tau and others, the dog also hid behind that woman, even that black-robed god was also hiding under the carriage trembling, the remaining Chu Wild Lion and Sun Zhuge looked at each other.
<br><br>"We?"
<br><br>Nodding in unison, they also became flustered. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>For a time, the whole battlefield ghosts and wolves cry.
<br><br>Just like that, it lasted for a whole quarter of an hour.
<br><br>"Buzz!"
<br><br>Finally, a sword sound was emitted from the carriage, and a figure in green swept out of the air.
<br><br>"Swoosh!"
<br><br>"Swoosh!"
<br><br>Since she came out, Yi Feng and the others who were originally being chased everywhere turned the situation around.
<br><br>These mountain bandits were like cutting leeks in the hands of the green-clothed woman, falling one by one.
<br><br>"Ooooooooo, lady warrior I was wrong."
<br><br>Seeing that all his men were dead, the mountain bandit leader Kuang Gang flung himself to the ground.
<br><br>"Lady warrior spare my life, I have an 80-year-old mother and a yellow child, you have a high hand, let me go as a fart, kill me dirty your hands ah ......"
<br><br>He just finished his voice, a light swept through, Kuang Gang's head flew up high.
<br><br>The woman in green only then withdrew her sword.
<br><br>Looking around at the trembling Yi Feng and others, she shook her head.
<br><br>Mortals are mortals after all!
<br><br>"All right, stop shouting."
<br><br>She glared at Old Wang Tau and Pork Rong, who were holding the wheel and shivering, and drank with an impatient face.
<br><br>And aside, Yi Feng also came over with a face full of sweat.
<br><br>"The girl is really powerful!"
<br><br>Yi Feng clasped his fist and said.
<br><br>"All right, you guys, stop flattering!" The woman in green clothes said with a lecturing tone, "I really don't know how you people are so bold, just a few of you dare to go from Pingjiang City to Nansha, really a newborn calf is not a tiger!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was embarrassed.
<br><br>It was his first time to go out, and he didn't know it was so dangerous.
<br><br>"But you people are really lucky, there is no less people in this situation not to mention, even the missing arms and legs are not broken."
<br><br>"Especially you."
<br><br>Saying that, the green-clothed woman turned her gaze towards Grand Master Wang.
<br><br>Because in the center point of Master Wang with his buttocks as the range, the ground left hundreds of knife marks, hard not to cut Master Wang in a knife.
<br><br>After a number of accidents, the crowd only to get back on the road.
<br><br>"Looking at your age, you shouldn't be too old, right?" On the carriage, the woman in green asked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yes, it's not too old!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>"I'm curious about you mortals, why don't you cultivate?"
<br><br>The woman in green mocked lightly, "But if you cultivated a little today, you wouldn't be in such a mess, fortunately you are lucky to have met me and you on the same road, otherwise your luck wouldn't be able to last forever!"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>This woman, really fucking which pot is not open to mention which pot.
<br><br>Can cultivate he will not go to cultivate?
<br><br>At first he also tried to join the Castle Peak Sect, ah, talent waste directly let the Castle Peak Sect talent detection stone are invalid.
<br><br>"Ahem!"
<br><br>On the side, old man Wang coughed heavily and looked at the woman in green and said, "Girl, can you shut your mouth!"
<br><br>Silky hostility was forced out from old man Wang's eyes.
<br><br>This woman is really not open-minded ah, actually caused the gentleman displeased, fortunately the gentleman did not have a big anger, otherwise everyone will have to eat.
<br><br>And this sentence of the old head of Wang, immediately made the woman in green lost her mind and was greatly alarmed.
<br><br>But when she looked at Old Man Wang again, she found that the latter still looked like the same old man, no matter how much she perceived, the latter was just a mediocre old man.
<br><br>"Illusion?"
<br><br>The woman in green shook off her head, then did not put this matter in mind, and did not say anything more to Yi Feng and old man Wang.
<br><br>As the saying goes, mortals are mortals after all, if they were really motivated, they wouldn't be in this state.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>The relationship between the original is not much, but also the same road for the time being.
<br><br>At this point, old man Wang's cloudy gaze suddenly moved.
<br><br>The gaze to Yi Feng, see Yi Feng is still the same bland look, the old man Wang only then returned to the bland look.
<br><br>It was a long time before the woman in green, who had her eyes closed, noticed something and her face changed violently.
<br><br>Standing up, holding a long sword in his hand immediately swept out of the carriage.
<br><br>"What's wrong again, a shock!"
<br><br>Yi Feng also hastily lifted the curtain, is to see the head cut a knife light, the woman in green clothed hand longsword is to meet this knife.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Sword clash, there was a pleasant sonic boom.
<br><br>Knife light cracked, the woman in green also folded back to the carriage, eyes staring intently into the distance.
<br><br>After the sword light, two figures came in the air and stopped in front of the caravan, suspended in mid-air, their murderous gaze fixed on the woman in green.
<br><br>"Li Yihan, finally found you."
<br><br>The man in the lead revealed a cold smile and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Night Meditation Moon, Cold Star Fan, Night Cold Twin Furies, it's actually the two of you who have personally come after us!"
<br><br>The green-clothed woman's face turned white, clenching her red lips filled with reluctance.
<br><br>Then, she inclined her head towards the carriage behind her and said, "Everyone, these two are Martial King experts, I definitely can't leave, but I will try to cover your departure."
<br><br>"Remember, before I fall, run as far away as possible, because these two people are extremely ruthless, once they catch up with you, they will never let you go."
<br><br>Saying that, the green-clothed woman moved her long sword in her hand and took the initiative to meet towards the Night Cold Twin Furies.
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>The sonic boom in mid-air was incessant.
<br><br>But the discerning eye can see that the woman in green is no match for the Night Cold Twin Furies, and in less than a few moments, she took a palm to the chest and fell to the ground.
<br><br>"What are you still standing there, hurry up and go!"
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng and the others still floundering in place, she hissed and said as she chopped the ground with her paws, gritting her teeth and rushing up with her sword again.
<br><br>"Sir, we?"
<br><br>Seeing this, the old king's head and pork rong and others all looked Yi Feng to Yi Feng.
