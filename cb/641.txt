"Defeat Li Qingxuan with what?"
<br><br>Gong Chen snickered.
<br><br>"Senior brother, to put it bluntly, this time I came back specifically to find you two, father and son."
<br><br>"Because I will bring Chong'er a great opportunity!"
<br><br>"As long as Chong'er successfully obtains this great chance, what Li Qingxuan, that's just a fart!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Lu Zun father and son's eyes lit up.
<br><br>With a face full of expectation, they asked, "What kind of chance is it?"
<br><br>"Hehehe!"
<br><br>Gong Chen raised his mouth with a smile and said, "Of course it's to enter the Dark Shadow Island for further training!"
<br><br>"Dark Shadow Island?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The father and son's two eyes glared.
<br><br>The gaze towards Gong Chen was full of disappointment.
<br><br>"Senior brother, now that things are like this, you shouldn't make fun of us." Lu Zun's face was ugly.
<br><br>"Yes senior brother, that Dark Shadow Island is a person who avoids it, where is the chance, this joke is not funny at all." Lu Chong also said at the side.
<br><br>"Hmph, I knew you guys wouldn't believe it!"
<br><br>Gong Chen seemed to have expected this, and then the aura on his body was violently released.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"True Element Immortal Realm?"
<br><br>Noticing the aura on Gong Chen's body, Lu Zun was filled with shock, "Senior brother how could you possibly reach the True Origin Immortal realm, weren't you only at the early stage of Reincarnation Mirror before?"
<br><br>"How so fast ......"
<br><br>Once he said that, he seemed to remember something and exclaimed, "You wouldn't be in Dark Shadow Island?"
<br><br>"Smart!"
<br><br>Gong Chen appreciated: "To tell you the truth, there is a high person on Dark Shadow Island, I met that high person when I was dying on Dark Shadow Island, and now not only saved my life, but also let my cultivation leap to the True Origin Immortal Realm!"
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>Gong Chen raised his head proudly, and that white-robed figure appeared in his mind.
<br><br>"Speaking of that one gentleman, ah, it's simply an existence like an exiled immortal!"
<br><br>"Shadow Island is a prison, a place of danger in the eyes of others."
<br><br>"But in his eyes, it's just one of the back gardens!"
<br><br>"And the reason why I was able to leave Dark Shadow Island is because of that one!"
<br><br>Lu Zun father and son both heard the words, and their eyes were filled with shock.
<br><br>"In this world, is there really such a powerful person?"
<br><br>"I can't lie to you guys?" Gong Chen said in a deep voice: "Even if you don't believe my words, the cultivation level on my body can't lie to you."
<br><br>Lu Zun was silent.
<br><br>Indeed.
<br><br>The Gong Chen before he went to Dark Shadow Island was only at the early stage of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm.
<br><br>If it wasn't as Gong Chen said, he wouldn't have been able to break through the True Origin Immortal Realm in such a short period of time anyway.
<br><br>"Then, senior brother, do you mean that you are going to take Chong'er into Dark Shadow Island?"
<br><br>Lu Zun couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Uh, although sir has broken through the transmission array, we are able to enter and exit at any time, but bringing people is definitely not an option." Gong Chen said solemnly, "Because the primary need to become a person of Mister is a prisoner inside the Shadow Island."
<br><br>"Why must it be a prisoner?"
<br><br>Lu Zun couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"This is a bit scary to say the least."
<br><br>Gong Chen took a deep breath, then under the two people's expectant gaze, he lowered his voice and said word by word: "From the various actions of the gentleman, it seems that he should be going against the Heaven's Immortal Hall, intending to overthrow the Heaven's Immortal Hall, intending to build a new Heaven's Immortal Hall."
<br><br>"What, intend to overthrow the Heaven's Immortal Hall?"
<br><br>The father and son looked shocked.
<br><br>This information.
<br><br>It was simply too big.
<br><br>This kind of thing in the past, they simply did not even dare to think about it.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They also understood why they only needed the Dark Shadow Island prisoners.
<br><br>Because the Dark Shadow Island was originally the prison of the Heaven's Immortal Palace, and the prisoners of the Dark Shadow Island were equivalent to being the enemies of the Heaven's Immortal Palace.
<br><br>"It's just that it's too big, once you get it wrong, you'll lose your life!"
<br><br>Lu Zun said gruffly.
<br><br>"What loss of life or not." Gong Chen sneered, "Do you really think that replacing the Heaven's Immortal Hall will be very difficult for Mr.?"
<br><br>"Then you guys are very wrong."
<br><br>"If my guess is correct, sir is just idle and looking for fun."
<br><br>"Looking for fun?"
<br><br>Both Lu Zun's father and son were filled with question marks.
<br><br>Replacing the Heaven's Immortal Hall and just looking for fun?
<br><br>"Don't believe me yet, replacing the Heaven's Immortal Hall is really a trivial matter for sir, and he doesn't even need his hand, I'm afraid that the thousand human immortals on the island will be able to bulldoze the Heaven's Immortal Hall." Gong Chen said.
<br><br>"One thousand human immortals?"
<br><br>The father and son were dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Forget it, you won't understand even if you say it, just say it, do you want this chance or not?" Gong Chen asked.
<br><br>The father and son looked at each other.
<br><br>Gritting their teeth, they nodded and said, "Okay!"
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Gong Chen nodded his head in satisfaction.
<br><br>"However, I'm still worried, with Chong'er like this, is there really a way to go to Shadow Island?" Lu Zun worriedly asked.
<br><br>"What's there?"
<br><br>Gong Chen said with a raised eyebrow: "You are just a little more wasted, to the Shadow Island, only need to further training for three months, but also can give you into the dragon!"
<br><br>Gong Chen's words.
<br><br>Is said the two people more and more confident.
<br><br>Also let the eyes have been dark Lu Chong, the eyes re-flash with the light of hope.
<br><br>"But senior brother, and you can't take Chong'er in, then how can I get into Dark Shadow Island?" Lu Zun couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Hey."
<br><br>"This is simple."
<br><br>"Didn't the Heaven's Immortal Hall set up branches in each division, so tonight we'll ask Chon'er to go and light a fire and burn the motherfucker down!"
<br><br>Gong Chen said with a smirk.
