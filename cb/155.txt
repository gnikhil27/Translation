"I really thought that this punk had gotten some kind of chance and recognized a powerful master as his master, but now it seems that I was overly worried!"
<br><br>"Listen to my order, follow me to trample down this martial hall, except for that trash, no one else will be left alive!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng emitted an icy cold voice, lifted her long legs and stepped towards the martial hall.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Several black-robed experts behind them also moved quickly and followed Ao Qingcheng closely.
<br><br>Just then, another black robe like a rat flickered and came sneaking up behind them, seemingly wanting to join their group.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>The appearance of this black shadow was seen by the last person walking in the group, and he glared up to question, but before his voice could come out, he was slapped into the sky and disappeared into the sky.
<br><br>After finishing this man, the black-robed man joined their group smoothly, then puffed up his chest and followed them in a serious manner towards the front.
<br><br>However, the team had just undergone such a big change, Ao Qingcheng and the others did not notice it in the slightest, their faces still wore a trusting smile.
<br><br>Soon, they had already walked to the entrance of the martial arts school. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng footsteps a meal, after waving a jade hand, harsh gaze swept around the martial arts hall.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>She did not take it lightly, and even after reaching the entrance of the martial arts school, she still did not forget to probe for any unusual places.
<br><br>Just as she cast her gaze at the signboard, the last person in the group moved his head.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>The voice fell, and the powerful martial intent contained on that martial sign immediately disappeared, and the eighteen divine weapon diagrams also lost their effect.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The mediocre signboard did not allow Ao Qingcheng's gaze to stay for a moment, and quickly scanned the surrounding area without any surprises.
<br><br>"Ao Qing ah Ao Qing ah, I would like to see, after I expose your lies in front of you, whether you can still be as emboldened as before!"
<br><br>She raised the corner of her mouth disdainfully.
<br><br>It was even more confirmed that there was no expert inside this small martial arts school.
<br><br>Unable to help herself, she waved again towards the subordinates behind her, then with a step, stepped into the martial arts hall.
<br><br>The front hall.
<br><br>Empty and wide.
<br><br>There are eighteen pictures on both sides, Ao Qingcheng swept a glance and did not find anything surprising.
<br><br>This front hall.
<br><br>No more interest for her to continue to stop.
<br><br>"Ao Qing is inside, there is also a human breath, you kill that human, I control Ao Qing." Ao Qingcheng said in a cold voice, sending out a commanding voice.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Since she had already figured out the situation, she was no longer interested in playing with Ao Qing.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>All of them answered in unison, and with Ao Qingcheng's order, a group of people swept out quickly and rushed towards the back hall.
<br><br>"Giggle Giggle ......"
<br><br>At this time, one of the black-robed people emitted a teasing smile.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng frowned slightly, before she had time to find out who was making the sound, she felt a hot and blinding light shining.
<br><br>She busily turned her gaze toward it and found that a mirror was hanging above their heads.
<br><br>"Demon subduing mirror?"
<br><br>"How can there be a Demon Suppressing Mirror here, and it's still a Saintly Demon Suppressing Mirror!?"
<br><br>Seeing this mirror, Ao Qingcheng's face changed greatly, and she hurriedly turned her head away, not daring to look directly at the light shining out of the mirror.
<br><br>Because the Demon Suppressing Mirror had an absolute suppression effect on their demon beasts.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>She still underestimated the power of this mirror.
<br><br>"Ow, ow, ow!"
<br><br>Without supporting half a breath, those black-clothed men of hers were suppressed into their original bodies under the illumination of this light, and while scurrying around like crazy, a burst of wailing sounds came out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's face changed dramatically, but before she could escape, she felt that she also became riddled with power under this light, only holding on for one more breath, she was also unable to maintain her prototype, turning into a white sky-devouring demon wolf struggling on the ground.
<br><br>"What a strong power!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng's heart was gloomy, cold sweat flowing on her body, the suppression of this power not only made it difficult for her to stand, but she couldn't even open her mouth to convey orders towards her subordinates.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow ......"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>Just when Ao Qingcheng and the others were all struggling to resist the power of the demon subduing mirror, there was a black-robed man holding his stomach, stepping on a stool and pointing at them to pass out a mocking voice.
<br><br>The appearance of this person immediately ushered in the hateful gaze of the crowd.
<br><br>A tiny human.
<br><br>How dare they mock their noble Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan, if not now under the Demon Subduing Mirror can not exert half power, will definitely be thirsty off this person's flesh and blood.
<br><br>Not one of us.
<br><br>Who is he?
<br><br>When did he get here?
<br><br>And Ao Qingcheng gaze also deadly stare at this black-robed man, revealing a face full of hatred at the same time, guessing the origin of this person.
<br><br>But did not find in this person's body, there are any breath fluctuations.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, a bunch of little trash, still dare to stare at me!"
<br><br>The black-robed man stood on the stool with another tirade sound, then jumped down from the stool and viciously kicked the asses of the crowd, even Ao Qingcheng received a heavy kick.
<br><br>This kick instantly made Ao Qingcheng feel doubly humiliated.
<br><br>A small human actually dare to kick her, how can this be?
<br><br>How dare he?
