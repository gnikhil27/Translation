Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Jia Jia Qin herded a group of little divine phoenixes, arriving in the middle of a barren land like a duck.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"What are you doing driving so many little animals, senior brother?"
<br><br>At this time, Shen Nong flew from the sky, holding a large cabbage in his hand.
<br><br>"Oh, just bred some small phoenix, hybrid, this is not the master summoned us back, it is also considered to bring some special products to him." Jia Jia Qin said.
<br><br>"It just so happens that I also, this cabbage is also carefully cultivated by me, take back to let Chiyi bucket of senior brother to give the master the whole hand-torn cabbage." Shen Nong said.
<br><br>And while the two were chatting.
<br><br>A cloak-tied, bare-headed youth with a pair of dead fish eyes rolled over, quickly ran this way.
<br><br>"Senior brother Bai Qiyu, it looks like you can't fly yet!" Jia Jia Qin couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Uh, heh heh." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Bai Qiyu touched his open bald head.
<br><br>Distant sky.
<br><br>Mighty pressure descended.
<br><br>A red-robed Su Yunyun stepped into the air.
<br><br>On the other side, the pagoda-wielding Tsukiyama likewise rushed in.
<br><br>After that.
<br><br>Li Jin, Xiao Zhan, Mo Tianji, Li Tai Bai, Huatuo and others rushed in.
<br><br>Not long after, the other senior brothers also arrived.
<br><br>"Excluding Senior Brother Zhong Qing and Senior Brother Wu Tao, and Senior Sister Yunmai who had been staying at the Heaven and Earth Sect, the other senior brothers plus Senior Brother Wu Tian from the outer sect, a total of ninety-seven people."
<br><br>Su Yun Yun counted the number of people.
<br><br>But how to count.
<br><br>All found one less.
<br><br>"Where is senior brother Hong Crazy?"
<br><br>After looking around, Su Yun Yun finally found out who was missing, so she asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"Oh, sister, I forgot to tell you, Brother Hung Crazy is here."
<br><br>Saying that, Li Jin lifted a body wrapped bag, filled with Hong Crazy's broken flesh, he said breathlessly, "Before receiving the Master's jade brief, Senior Brother Hong got into a fight with someone and blew himself up."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The crowd in the room have a black line.
<br><br>This guy.
<br><br>Still moving to blow himself up?
<br><br>"All right, since the master summoned us, let's hurry back!"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun said, "But Master has always been very demanding of us, I think all of you should have achieved something in the Immortal World by now!"
<br><br>"Of course!"
<br><br>"I'm now one of the continental masters of the middle three continents."
<br><br>One of the disciples said.
<br><br>"I am now an elder of one of the Immortal Sects in the Upper Three Continents."
<br><br>Another disciple said.
<br><br>"The demonic beasts I have bred now are enough to sweep any of the Middle Three Continents when released." Jia Jia Qin said.
<br><br>"The vegetables I grow can make mortals become immortal on the ground."
<br><br>Shen Nong also shouted.
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>"I still can't fly, but I can jump to the moon."
<br><br>Bai Qiyu rubbed his head and rolled his dead fish eyes again.
<br><br>"I am now, able to make any Middle Three Continents Lord catch a white blade with his empty hand." Li Jin also transmitted his voice, then lifted the body wrapped bag in his hand and added, "By the way, also, Senior Brother Hong Crazy is also able to pull any Middle Three Continents Lord to the same death."
<br><br>One by one, the disciples reported what they had achieved.
<br><br>The least helpful.
<br><br>They were also able to mix a continental lord in a slightly worse continent in the middle three continents.
<br><br>"Very good, everyone is very good, after this achievement goes back, I think it will be able to obtain the appreciation of the master." Su Yun Yun was satisfied and nodded her head repeatedly.
<br><br>"Senior sister, I wonder what your achievement is?"
<br><br>The others looked at each other.
<br><br>"Me." Su Yun Yun smiled playfully, "Currently, I'm already a continent master of one of the upper three continents."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Still senior sister is awesome."
<br><br>The crowd was shocked.
<br><br>As we all know, the one hundred and eight continents of the Immortal World are divided into the upper three continents, the middle three continents, and the lower three continents.
<br><br>The lower three continents, to put it bluntly, are actually slums, and the strength of an immortal continent master, I'm afraid, is only around the cultivation level of a Golden Immortal.
<br><br>While the three continents, the level is greatly enhanced, the continent lord at least are Star Immortal realm cultivation, this is still the worst continent lord strength.
<br><br>And the upper three continents.
<br><br>On the other hand, it is unimaginable.
<br><br>One of the random immortal continent elders walked out, I'm afraid it is also the strength of the sun and moon immortal realm after.
<br><br>And the upper three continents immortal continent lord, its strength is simply unfathomable.
<br><br>"Well, is brothers need not be discouraged, I also just a few days earlier than everyone with the master, we should hurry back to face the master."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>All people responded in unison.
<br><br>Many forces gathered together.
<br><br>It directly tore the Immortal Realm barrier and returned to the Immortal River Continent.
