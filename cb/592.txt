Genius, what a genius himself.
<br><br>I can actually rely on a low level immortal class and fight across the seventh level.
<br><br>A genius that is rarely found in ten thousand years.
<br><br>That's right, it was himself!
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed out loud.
<br><br>But ...... also perhaps he himself is no longer just a human immortal.
<br><br>As for how to upgrade?
<br><br>Not even cultivated.
<br><br>But then again, he has never cultivated.
<br><br>Perhaps he came to this Immortal Qi floating Immortal Realm, due to his own talent is too demonic, Immortal Qi sucking, unknowingly upgrade the level.
<br><br>Therefore, their current realm, may be the earth immortal has not become impossible. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And the reason why the system shows unknown, perhaps this system is too much garbage.
<br><br>After all, the system is what he got when he was in the mortal world.
<br><br>Junk system maybe the upper limit is also only the mortal realm cultivation, at most to the human immortal cultivation. Beyond the human immortal, this system is no longer useful.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>Anyway, he is now a super genius, the system is just a chicken rib.
<br><br>As for the realm, what the hell, anyway, as long as you know, now relying on a thought finger, he is invincible below the Earth Immortal is.
<br><br>In Yi Feng happy to leave.
<br><br>After some time, Guo Shijie received a report from his disciples.
<br><br>Yi Feng was not killed, but instead, the Earth Immortal Perfection class that he sent out, turned into a puddle of blood and flesh.
<br><br>Guo Shijie was furious, "How are you guys doing? You can't even solve a mere Human Immortal!"
<br><br>The disciple under the sect lowered his head and mumbled, "Maybe there was someone around that Yi Feng to help."
<br><br>"Someone under the door saw Yi Feng go to the personal disciple of Peak Master Liu, You Duxing."
<br><br>"You Dohang?" Guo Shijie recited this name with an air of danger.
<br><br>Indeed, Yi Feng was only at Human Immortal cultivation.
<br><br>To be able to kill it, someone must have helped.
<br><br>"He's really lucky." He mused, "However, I don't believe his luck will always be that good."
<br><br>"Next time, just find a Golden Immortal to do it."
<br><br>"But it's already alerted the snake, so we have to wait for now."
<br><br>"Go down first!"
<br><br>That little bastard he must kill, otherwise it's hard to relieve his heart's hatred!
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The disciples under the door answered and left.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng realized that not only was he a rare talent that was rare in ten thousand years, but it was also extremely likely that he had unknowingly upgraded his cultivation.
<br><br>The mood is extremely good.
<br><br>Want to find someone to drink and get high.
<br><br>The first person who came to mind was senior brother You Solo.
<br><br>So carrying a wine jug happily towards the You Duxing residence and go.
<br><br>But when he went to You Duxing's place, he learned that Brother You Duxing was not there.
<br><br>"Senior brother just got called out, seems to be something." The other disciples here saw Yi Feng and said to him, "Why, what is senior brother Yi looking for senior brother You?"
<br><br>Although Yi Feng was only a Human Immortal, they all knew each other.
<br><br>After all, he had hit the face of Sun Moon Peak's Peak Master Guo in front of the public.
<br><br>Sun Moon Peak and Star Peak had been at odds for a long time, and Star Peak had never been slightly inferior. So being oppressed can be a lot.
<br><br>The last time Yi Feng as a disciple of Star Peak hit the face of Lord Guo, so they can not help but admire and like this kid.
<br><br>Therefore, see Yi Feng is very close.
<br><br>"Then when will senior brother You come back?"
<br><br>"We don't know exactly." An Earth Immortal early stage disciple asked.
<br><br>"But, what's the matter with Senior Brother Yi? When Senior Brother You comes back later, we can convey it for you."
<br><br>Seeing that the senior brothers were so enthusiastic, they were quite nice to talk to.
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the wine pot in his hand and shook it, "It's not much, it's just that I've met something happy and want to find senior brothers to drink and celebrate."
<br><br>"Harm! I thought it was something!" Next to the earth immortal disciple Chunlai a palm, happy: "Why, you brother can drink with you? And we can't?"
<br><br>"Yes, as if no one can drink! You know that when I was in the mortal realm, I had the title of not being able to pour a thousand glasses!" Xia Wang, another Earth Immortal disciple, also laughed in response.
<br><br>"Hey brother this is a bit scary ah, a thousand cups can not fall, I am afraid this is not enough to stuff your teeth?" Yi Feng also laughed, he carried the wine jug turned around and waved his hand, "Go, today I will take the senior brothers to drink a few mouthfuls."
<br><br>"A thousand cups no, we also drink through the refreshing!"
<br><br>Several brothers behind also laughing to follow, "go go go, let's all go! Taste the wine of senior brother Yi!"
<br><br>"Good, this is a good taste! Brother You will not have this blessing. Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>A group of people jokingly followed Yi Feng, heading towards the mountain forest of Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>There were dishes there that he had asked for from the Sun Moon Peak kitchen.
<br><br>A group of people walked to the forest, they saw a mat spread by the stream, the mat was full of wine and meat, and in the middle, there was a pot.
<br><br>Below the fire, the soup on top of the boiling goo bubbles.
<br><br>The brothers behind Yi Feng all swallowed their saliva.
<br><br>"Good guys, so many good things, where did senior brother Yi get them?" Chunlai asked happily.
<br><br>Rarely did anyone in the Sun Moon Sect eat, they all cultivated with a clean stomach.
<br><br>Even if there is, it is also people with status who no longer cultivate with incorruptibility.
<br><br>Or the upper echelons, who sometimes eat some immortal realm food to help with cultivation, or only when feasting on guests.
<br><br>"The kitchen got it." Yi Feng sat down on the mat first, then invited all the senior brothers to come and sit.
<br><br>Although most of the disciples of the Sun Moon Sect were incorruptible, there was still a proper back kitchen.
<br><br>One is needed for the sect banquet, and the other is to make some food to help cultivation for the elders or other senior members of the sect.
<br><br>They are disciples, generally the back kitchen will not provide food.
<br><br>"Hey, look, although senior brother Yi has only just entered my Sun Moon Peak, he has already hooked up with even the back kitchen. This ability, tsk," said Xia Wang, lifting his robe and sitting down on the mat.
<br><br>The food in front of him was glowing with eyes, smashing his mouth.
<br><br>"The back kitchen brought out these are good things." The senior brother next to him also rubbed his hands.
<br><br>"Come, come, let me pour wine for all the senior brothers." Yi Feng said, set up the utensils for the people, poured the wine, and started to eat.
<br><br>A group of people began to eat, talking and laughing.
<br><br>"Just now I heard that senior brother Yi is having fun, I wonder what's happy about it?" Senior Brother Chunlai nibbled on a steamed leg and said, "Say it so that everyone can be happy too."
<br><br>As soon as he heard this topic, Yi Feng hooked the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>"Harm, can't say anything great either." He said.
<br><br>"It's my talent, it's the once in a million years kind."
<br><br>"Get it?" He said, taking a despondent sip of wine, "You know, wistfulness."
<br><br>"Oh?!!!" One of the senior brothers said in shock, "Then this is a great good thing!"
<br><br>"If the patriarch knew about it, he might even personally take you over as a closed-door disciple to train!" The crowd echoed, very surprised.
<br><br>"Yes, I've only seen Senior Brother Yi practicing the One Thought Finger in one night, so I thought he was extremely talented." Chunlai said, "Unexpectedly, it's still a talent that comes along once in ten thousand years!"
<br><br>"Does our peak master know about this?"
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head, "Haven't told anyone yet."
<br><br>"Then no, such a big thing must be told to the peak master!" Xia Wang said, "Maybe the peak master will really inform the sect master."
<br><br>"When the time comes, senior brother Yi can really become the closed door disciple of the patriarch is not certain!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha, not so much not so much, hahaha," said Yi Feng modestly, the corners of his mouth cracked with laughter.
