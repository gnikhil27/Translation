At the sound of the words, the crowd at the scene has revealed a look of expectation.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Is it time to ask those guys to make a move again.
<br><br>Still remember.
<br><br>The last time they were asked to make a move, that Xiong Daxian's astonishing might that came down on his butt was still fresh in their minds even now.
<br><br>Under the frenzied gaze of the crowd, Wu Tian directly took out the sound transmission jade slip.
<br><br>Start shaking people.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>After a long half day, there was not a single echo.
<br><br>This caused the crowd's faces to change.
<br><br>"Settle down for a moment." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"My master and big brother usually don't ask about the world, it makes sense that they haven't seen the jade slip, it's just a little bit of trouble!"
<br><br>Wu Tian explained indifferently.
<br><br>Then he shouted, "Someone, hurry back to Yuancheng as fast as you can and inform my master and big brother of what's going on here!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Immediately, an expert stepped out and took the order to rush towards Yuancheng.
<br><br>"Gentlemen."
<br><br>"Now let's wait for my master's arrival in peace!"
<br><br>Wu Tian raised the corner of his mouth and said, then directly sat down in situ on the city tower.
<br><br>The rest of the people saw this and also followed Wu Tian and sat down.
<br><br>One night.
<br><br>Passed quietly.
<br><br>When the dawn came, everyone coincidentally opened their eyes, also felt an absolute sense of oppression appeared.
<br><br>When looking up, found that the sky has also changed color.
<br><br>Red, just like a sea of blood.
<br><br>And in the middle of the sea of blood, a red-robed man suddenly appeared.
<br><br>He was standing high above, emitting a cold intent, and his scarlet eyes were staring deadly at the crowd on the city tower.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The crowd, led by Wu Tian, also stood up, all revealing a grave gaze.
<br><br>Even Wu Tian frowned.
<br><br>Because the extinction was even stronger than he had imagined.
<br><br>Just the aura that was emitted made many people tremble.
<br><br>Of course the most gloomy thing is that the world of extermination has come, but Yi Feng and Bone Ben Wei have not yet sent news.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Thinking about all the means of Yi Feng, Wu Tian's eyebrows re-expanded.
<br><br>This super master of his, always planning, and when has he ever failed to make a plan.
<br><br>This time, he certainly wouldn't either!
<br><br>"You are Wu Tian?"
<br><br>Perdition's icy gaze looked around the room and finally settled directly on Wu Tian's body.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Remembering that he had Yi Feng behind him, Wu Tian wasn't afraid and slowly took a step out.
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>The pupils of the Exterminator shrank, and then cleanly slapped down towards Wu Tian.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The loss of qi brought him anger and made him lose the interest of scrapping his mouth.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Wu Tian's body cultivation is also a horrible spread.
<br><br>But also knew that a hard fight is simply impossible to be a match for the extermination, so stepped into the air and flew up towards the distance to dodge.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Although he dodged quickly, but the residual power of the world of destruction still hit him.
<br><br>Wu Tian landed on the ground with a bang, smashing a big crater.
<br><br>"The king."
<br><br>"My Lord!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the people of Wu Tian Empire showed their concern and hurriedly sent out their voices.
<br><br>"Don't panic, he can't kill me."
<br><br>Wu Tian climbed up from the pit, wiped the corner of his mouth, and stared at Perisher in a cold voice.
<br><br>The pupils of the Exterminator shrank.
<br><br>"Although you did have some strength to dodge my blow, but I killed you as easy as crushing an ant, where did you get the courage to say that?" The Exterminator shouted icily.
<br><br>"Hey!"
<br><br>"I am not afraid to tell you, the reason why I am not afraid of you is because I have my master and big brother to cover me."
<br><br>"My master has a plan, even if you come here today, it is all in my master's calculations."
<br><br>Wu Tian puffed up his chest and transmitted a voice that was not afraid in the slightest.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Extinction's eyebrows twitched.
<br><br>In his heart, he also pondered on Wu Tian's mouth, that so-called master and big brother.
<br><br>He had always felt that from the beginning of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet, someone was behind it.
<br><br>Perhaps.
<br><br>The person who was doing this was none other than the master and big brother that Wu Tian was talking about.
<br><br>This made Extermination also slightly cautious.
<br><br>With his keen senses, he probed the surroundings at all times to prevent any accidents from appearing.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>Those who dared to interfere in the matter of qi luck would definitely not be a generalist either, so be careful.
<br><br>Just at this time.
<br><br>Outside the sky a figure quickly flying.
<br><br>Immediately attracted the attention of everyone.
<br><br>Wu Tian's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Because this person, was the very person he sent to Yuancheng to find Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>"My master and my big brother will be here soon."
<br><br>Immediately, he looked at Exterminating World and transmitted a wild and arrogant laugh.
<br><br>This instantly made the Exterminator even more alert.
<br><br>Because other than this person, he did not detect the appearance of other auras, indicating that the person coming was probably hiding in the shadows, and was not even weaker than him.
<br><br>"Haha, come on, where did my master and big brother go?"
<br><br>When the person got closer, Wu Tian asked expectantly in a hurry.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The man's face was ugly to the extreme, landing on both knees, his mouth swallowed and said, "Great Lord, Sir and Lord Bones they left in a hurry last night overnight, now I'm afraid they have already left the Wu Tian Empire."
<br><br>The moment these words fell.
<br><br>Wu Tian's face twitched.
<br><br>The heart was even a thud, and was suddenly dumbfounded.
<br><br>Master ......
<br><br>Gone, gone?
<br><br>For, why?
<br><br>The master is not a tent?
<br><br>Why did he leave.
<br><br>The other people of the Wu Tian Empire, their hopes were dashed.
<br><br>The other people of the Wu Tian Empire, the hope in their hearts dashed, is also suddenly ashen.
<br><br>And full of vigilance of the world heard, but also can not help but froze.
<br><br>Carefully get half a day, and this?
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Wasting my time, really think what an expert, go to hell!"
<br><br>The exterminator who thought he was being teased had completely lost his patience, and a sea of blood-red blood filled the air and enveloped towards Wu Tian.
<br><br>At once.
<br><br>Wu Tian was enveloped by a thick sea of blood.
<br><br>Then above his head, a blood-red palm print, covered down towards him.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Wu Tian's eyes were covered with blood, and his expression was filled with unwillingness.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>"Why."
<br><br>"Why did you hint at me to attack the Cloud Top Empire, yet you didn't back me up and left yourself, I'm not willing ......"
<br><br>Along with Wu Tian's reluctant hissing came out, this palm of Extinction finally fell down.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The ground smashed out a big crater.
<br><br>The Wu Tian who was at the center of the attack bore the brunt of the attack, his internal organs were shattered, and he fell to the ground and died under the bleeding of his seven orifices.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Noticing that Wu Tian had completely lost his breath, the exterminator only coldly snorted, faintly swept a glance at the others, directly transformed into a blood vanish and left.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>His target was only Wu Tian, the others, he couldn't even mention his interest.
<br><br>"The king."
<br><br>"My Lord!"
<br><br>And only after Extinction left did the rest of the Wu Tian Empire react and hurriedly rushed towards Wu Tian's corpse.
<br><br>When they saw that Wu Tian was dead, cries arose.
<br><br>Countless people knelt on the ground, and various wailing sounds came out ......
