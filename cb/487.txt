"Ruyan be careful."
<br><br>The moment the sword came out, Yin Tianxiong, who was outside the ring, felt the terror and quickly warned out loud.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Even though he warned in time, Liu Ruyan still couldn't dodge the blow, the tip of the sword that flew out, it was like it was completely locked onto her, no matter how much she struggled, she still had more heart than strength.
<br><br>The shoulder was instantly penetrated, leaving a shocking blood hole.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan also flew backwards in response, smashing heavily on the ground, struggling to get up on the ground for a long time.
<br><br>One strike, defeated in seconds!
<br><br>"How is this possible?"
<br><br>"Oh my god, what the hell is going on here, did I see it wrong?"
<br><br>"How could this be the result!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Also at the same time, the hundreds of thousands of spectators in the square, set off a wave of clamor, emitting all kinds of unbelievable voices.
<br><br>Originally Xiao Zhan was able to catch Liu Ruyan's blow, it was enough to surprise them, but did not expect a wave to rise again.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan actually instantly, knocked away Liu Ruyan?
<br><br>Such a result was completely unacceptable to them.
<br><br>Originally they came to see how Liu Ruyan's great display of power crushed Xiao Zhan, but the result was a different matter.
<br><br>It can be said.
<br><br>It was out of everyone's expectation.
<br><br>And Liu Ruyan clutched her injured shoulder, lying on the ground while breathing sharply, and her eyes were deadly staring straight at Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>This punk ......
<br><br>How could this punk defeat me?
<br><br>No.
<br><br>Impossible.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan was completely unable to accept such a result, and even more unable to accept that her status as the Heavenly Spirit Saintess was actually blatantly defeated by this trash Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>Especially, the unbelievable gazes in the field were like mocking her.
<br><br>"Go to hell!"
<br><br>She raised the broken sword in her hand in anger, and her Earth Immortal strength was displayed unguardedly.
<br><br>A sword of Ling Tian.
<br><br>It swung down.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"This seems to be the Heavenly Spirit Sect's Immortal Technique Heavenly Spirit Sword Move."
<br><br>"Yes, the Heavenly Spirit Sword Stance is an authentic immortal method, although it is only a low level, it is one of the Heavenly Spirit Sect's Zhenshan Sword Stances, this Liu Ruyan Heavenly Posture is really terrifying, the Earth Immortal strength has cultivated the Heavenly Spirit Sword Stance."
<br><br>"Yes, with the immortal method in hand, even if it is not difficult to fight beyond the level!"
<br><br>"It seems that today, the result is still unpredictable ah!"
<br><br>The scene cheered.
<br><br>Originally thought to be a battle without suspense.
<br><br>The development up to now, but far more exciting than imagined, can be said to be a twist twist twist and twist.
<br><br>While outside the ring, Yin Tianxiong was staring at the field with a cold expression.
<br><br>Although Xiao Zhan's surprise had caused him to lose his temper a bit, but Liu Ruyan was after all his personal disciple, so how could he not have a little bottom card?
<br><br>This sword.
<br><br>This is Liu Ruyan's strongest card.
<br><br>Under this sword, there was no possibility for Xiao Zhan to overcome.
<br><br>"You are really out of my expectation today."
<br><br>"Everyone thought you were a waste, yet you are hiding so deep."
<br><br>"But it's still useless!"
<br><br>"Under this sword of mine, unless you possess the strength of a Heavenly Immortal, I'm afraid you will barely be able to take it, so right now, you will definitely die."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan looked at Xiao Zhan with a cold face, and at the same time when the sword mane in her hand fell, a cold voice came out.
<br><br>"Surely die?"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan faintly smiled.
<br><br>"I'm afraid that today is not able to do what you want."
<br><br>With the fall of his voice.
<br><br>An overwhelming aura erupted from his body, and countless qi spread out.
<br><br>And under the surge of his cultivation, even Liu Ruyan, who had cast an immortal method, was dulled.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>The hundreds of thousands of spectators in the field, in this time also completely exploded.
<br><br>Countless other sects and great figures who were secretly watching the battle also stood up in unison at this moment.
<br><br>"Golden Immortal."
<br><br>"My goodness, this Xiao Zhan, Xiao Zhan is actually a Golden Immortal."
<br><br>"Isn't he a loser, how come he's suddenly a Golden Immortal."
<br><br>"I remember he seems to be similar to Liu Ruyan's age, right, twenty-year-old Golden Immortal, hiss ......"
<br><br>"Boy, who the hell said he was a waste before, come out to me, see if I can't cut you to death!"
<br><br>"This kid, hidden too deep, twenty-year-old Golden Immortal, this is more demonic than Liu Ruyan ah!"
<br><br>The noisy voices kept coming.
<br><br>Already stunned by the cultivation level on Xiao Zhan's body, it turned into a mess.
<br><br>The originally confident Yin Tianxiong and others also panicked collectively at this moment.
<br><br>At the same time, Liu Ruyan, who was full of cold light and had a clear chest, also changed her face, trembling with an unbelievable voice coming out of her mouth, "This is impossible, this is never possible, how could he have the strength of a Golden Immortal!?"
<br><br>She was completely unwilling to accept this fact.
<br><br>But what greeted her was a celestial hand.
<br><br>With a light palm, Xiao Zhan broke Liu Ruyan's attack.
<br><br>At the same time, Liu Ruyan, who had suffered a backlash, instantly flew backwards and landed heavily on the ring, just like a dead dog.
<br><br>"You've lost."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan said indifferently.
<br><br>These words fell on Liu Ruyan's ears, causing her body to tremble violently and a mouthful of blood to spit out violently, obviously her mind had been dealt a violent blow.
<br><br>"Do you still remember what you said that day?"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan looked at her and said indifferently, then raised his eyes to look around the room.
<br><br>"Today, I, Xiao Zhan, officially announce that I have dissolved my relationship with you, Liu Ruyan, and will have no further involvement."
<br><br>In one moment, a voice interspersed with aura came out of his mouth, rolling.
<br><br>Then a letter of repudiation rose up and floated down at Liu Ruyan's feet.
<br><br>Once Xiao Zhan's words fell.
<br><br>The whole room was in an uproar.
<br><br>Everyone did not expect that today would be such an outcome.
<br><br>I thought it was Liu Ruyan who withdrew Xiao Zhan's marriage, but never thought it was Xiao Zhan who gave Liu Ruyan a letter of repudiation!
<br><br>If this matter were to get out, how could Liu Ruyan gain a foothold in the Lingxu Realm?
<br><br>Poof!
<br><br>Looking at the letter of repudiation in front of her, Liu Ruyan spat out another mouthful of blood.
<br><br>Her face turned bloodless, and the powerful blow had caused the cultivation in her body to recoil.
<br><br>This was clearly her home turf.
<br><br>It was clearly her time to take advantage of the situation and make a name for herself, but in front of so many people, she was defeated by this trash that she had once withdrawn from, and was presented with a letter of repudiation by him.
<br><br>She was not willing.
<br><br>She was intensely unwilling.
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>She hissed hysterically.
<br><br>"It's just a matter of returning the favor of others!"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan looked at her indifferently and sent out a cautionary voice: "In addition, I will send you another sentence, there are mountains outside the mountains, there are people outside the people, your achievements, in my eyes today, are worse than bullshit!"
<br><br>A bullshit inferior, directly impacted Liu Ruyan's mind.
<br><br>Her mouth was spitting blood furiously under the injury as well as the repercussions, and her Earth Immortal realm, at this moment, fell down hard by one weight.
<br><br>"You take care of yourself."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan glanced at her calmly, without any half-hearted pity, turned around and left.
<br><br>Just at this moment.
<br><br>A palm print tumbled out and attacked towards the unsuspecting Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>This palm was extremely powerful and intimidated 90% of the people in the field.
<br><br>It was struck by Yin Tianxiong, the patriarch of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, whose eyes, at this moment, were flickering with a strong murderous spirit, and the palm print instantly reached the top of Xiao Zhan's head.
<br><br>This sudden change of events.
<br><br>Out of everyone's expectation.
<br><br>Even though Xiao Zhan's reaction was extremely fast and he raised his fist in time to counterattack, he still had more than enough strength to face the Xuan Xian realm Yin Tianxiong.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>A mouthful of blood spat out, and Xiao Zhan immediately flew backwards.
