At once, Black Feather fainted.
<br><br>Subsequently, it was dragged into the spatial ring by Yi Feng.
<br><br>Just like that.
<br><br>This immortal world emissary who was sent to investigate the ascension, just entered the immortal river continent, before taking two more breaths, planted here like this.
<br><br>"A big harvest this time, four such big beasts, locked in will definitely be able to fool a lot of people."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded with satisfaction and rushed back towards Pingjiang City with his great harvest.
<br><br>Pingjiang City.
<br><br>At the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Led by Ye Bei, Shake Heavenly Que, and Guan Yunpeng, there were 20 to 30 people gathered.
<br><br>And these people, at the lowest, were at the cultivation level of Martial Dignity.
<br><br>They are in the sects of the various regions of Eastern Victory, either the sect leader or the elder, in short, the status is very high. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And the purpose of their coming here is precisely at the invitation of Ye Bei and others to act as workers to build a house for Yi Feng.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>After arriving here, they were reluctant, and even more so, they greatly questioned the words of Shake Heavenly Que and the others.
<br><br>"Shake Heavenly Que, better give us a clear explanation." An old man took the lead and snapped, "What exactly is the reason you snubbed us to come here."
<br><br>"That is."
<br><br>Another person snapped, "Saying that you can bring us great opportunities, yet you came to such a small city where birds can't shit, what exactly is the reason for your business?"
<br><br>"Right, right, hurry up and say, you also know the status of us people, which is not the elders or the head of a family, usually have a lot of things to do, do not have so much free time to blindly delay with you."
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The crowd has been heard questioning voices.
<br><br>"Alas, you old pikers, will I still lie to you?"
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que hurriedly explained, "If I say I'll bring you a chance, I'm sure there will be a chance for you!"
<br><br>"Yes, you guys just wait obediently."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng also took up the fight: "If we weren't old acquaintances, otherwise this good thing wouldn't have been your turn."
<br><br>"Blow."
<br><br>"You two are desperately blowing."
<br><br>"I really believe in you guys, I really think there is some big chance, but I don't want it to be such a shitty place."
<br><br>At the words of the two Guan Yunpeng, the crowd scoffed and questioned even louder.
<br><br>"You people, why are your brains so twitchy?" Guan Yunpeng said with a sullen face, "Do you think we have the need to lie to you guys?"
<br><br>"Okay, since you didn't lie to us, let me ask you, is what you said about that supreme master true or not?" At this moment, someone came out and asked.
<br><br>"Of course it's true, I can't lie to you guys?" Guan Yunpeng answered.
<br><br>"Since you say it's true, then you should come up with a proof that makes us believe." The man said again.
<br><br>"Evidence ......"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng scratched his head and was in a dilemma.
<br><br>Where could he come up with any evidence of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Hmph, really can't get the evidence."
<br><br>"Go go go, let's hurry back to our own clan."
<br><br>"That's right, shouldn't have come a long time ago, still big chance, what a waste of time."
<br><br>Seeing this, Shake Heavenly Que and other people's faces were immediately anxious.
<br><br>After all, they have promised Yi Feng to recruit, so easy to get so many people, in case they leave, their efforts in vain is just, in case Yi Feng displeased that is the big thing.
<br><br>So Ye Bei hurriedly stopped the crowd, said with a solemn face: "Gentlemen, since you are here, why rush this moment to go, why not wait for Mr. back, you have a glimpse of the real face, do not know everything?"
<br><br>"Right, right, when you see the real face of the gentleman, you won't think we are lying to you." Shake Heavenly Que also hurriedly took over.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd who were ready to leave had a thoughtful look on their faces.
<br><br>Only after a long time did they nod reluctantly.
<br><br>"It doesn't matter if we wait a bit."
<br><br>"But we have said something ugly before, if it is not what you say, don't blame us for not remembering our old friendships and not giving face to leave."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Ye Bei smiled and said confidently, "When you have seen Mr.'s methods, you are guaranteed that you will not have the intention to leave again and will only try to stay by all means."
<br><br>After a short wait, a figure finally slowly rushed back from outside.
<br><br>"Mister is back!"
<br><br>Ye Bei stood up fiercely, his face full of excitement.
<br><br>And Guan Yunpeng and Shake Heavenly Que were no exception, the frenzy in their eyes could not be concealed.
<br><br>"Never remember, Mr. return to experience mortal experience life, so never expose cultivation in front of Mr. break the rules, understand?" Ye Bei three people were busy reminding towards the crowd behind them.
<br><br>Seeing the posture of these three people, the rest of the crowd could not help but glance at each other.
<br><br>The appearance of these three people pretending is not pretend, it seems to be really like that.
<br><br>Could it be.
<br><br>This shitty place, really hides a super expert?
<br><br>This instantly piqued their curiosity.
<br><br>They wanted to see if this so-called high man was really that high or not!
<br><br>So, they also cooperated with Shake Heavenly Que and the others to greet Yi Feng towards the returning Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Oh, it's you guys!"
<br><br>When Yi Feng saw the three Ye Bei, he immediately laughed.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Ye Bei's three people hurriedly saluted and smiled as they responded, "Enlightened sir, we have recruited the first batch of workers."
<br><br>Saying that, the three hurriedly shouted towards the crowd behind them, "Don't hurry up and meet sir."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>In the face of the three people's reminder, the crowd behind them did not take it seriously.
<br><br>Because in the short time just now, everyone had sized up Yi Feng.
<br><br>No cultivation.
<br><br>Plain and unexceptional.
<br><br>Even from head to toe, they could not see a single thing that made them feel bright.
<br><br>This is a high level person?
<br><br>The crowd was in complete disbelief.
<br><br>This immediately made Ye Bei three people anxious, squeezing eyebrows and making eyes at the crowd.
<br><br>But even so, in addition to a small number of people to give the three people face, slightly lowered their heads, most people did not respond.
<br><br>The good thing is.
<br><br>Let Ye Bei three people breathe a sigh of relief is that Yi Feng does not seem to take it to heart, instead, he said with a smile: "You do not need to be so polite, let's go, I'll show you the site."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng took the lead and walked towards the back of the martial arts school.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, the three Ye Bei immediately stomped their feet and shouted with hatred, "You old pikers, what do you want?"
<br><br>"Hmph, still asking us what we are doing, didn't you say that you are some kind of supreme master?"
<br><br>"That's right, this is what you call a supreme master?"
<br><br>The crowd scoffed.
<br><br>Totally did not believe the words of Shake Heavenly Que and others.
<br><br>After all, seeing is believing.
<br><br>They didn't see half of the brightest things on Yi Feng's body at all.
<br><br>"You, you guys, how can you be so foolish?"
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que said with a cold face, "Mister is something that you guys can see through? But you guys believe me, there will definitely be a time when you will be surprised."
<br><br>"Sorry, we really don't have time to play with you anymore."
<br><br>"Yes, our patriarch still has a great deal of things to do, so excuse us."
<br><br>"After being fooled by you three for so long, we've been kind enough to say goodbye."
<br><br>"Farewell ......"
