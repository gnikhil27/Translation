"Get out of the way!"
<br><br>"Get out of my way!"
<br><br>Before they even entered the stone door, the people who seemed to be talking peacefully a moment ago had already started to fight with swords.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Swords and sword shadows and martial skills coalesced, causing blasting sounds to continue.
<br><br>Many people turned into corpses and fell to the ground before they even entered the door.
<br><br>"Let's go too!"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong's pupils shrank, the feather fan in his hand shrank, and his entire person turned into a stream of light and rushed towards the stone door, and the two old men behind him followed along with him.
<br><br>At the same time, Yun Xian Que grabbed Yu Wu Jie, with the two old men behind him also rushed towards the stone door. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Miss!"
<br><br>"Miss!"
<br><br>Yang Mu and Yang Sen saw this and looked anxiously at Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>"I said, don't go." Yun Xian Que said through clenched teeth.
<br><br>The two took a look at the two great sects that had disappeared and heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Huh, the people from Wind and Cloud Valley actually didn't come in?" Fifth Longkong rushed towards the altar in front with great speed, while looking behind him, but did not find the figure of Wind and Cloud Valley, and could not help but transmit a puzzled voice.
<br><br>"Gongzi, don't mind them, it's important to obtain the holy relic." The fifth formation reminded.
<br><br>"That's right, the holy relic is the most important thing."
<br><br>Fifth Longkong brought his speed to the extreme and rushed towards the big hall in front of him with a face full of frenzy.
<br><br>Finally, that big hall was already close at hand, and the three holy relics were already beckoning to him.
<br><br>However, at this moment, an icy voice suddenly appeared.
<br><br>"Humph, if you want to obtain the holy relics, have you asked my Heavenly Sword Sect?"
<br><br>At the same time as the voice fell, a greenish-red sword light suddenly appeared and came down with a bang.
<br><br>Seeing this, Fifth Longkong's face changed, the feather fan in his hand spread out, and several sharp weapons shot out.
<br><br>"Dang Dang Dang!"
<br><br>The sword light dissipated.
<br><br>But this sword, also completely blocked the path of the fifth long sky forward.
<br><br>When he looked up again, he found that several people from the Heavenly Sword Sect appeared in front of him.
<br><br>"Peng Xian'er!"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong clenched his teeth.
<br><br>Then with a wave of his feather fan, a sharp cold aura cut out, while his body turned into a stream of light and attacked towards Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>The two of the fifth formation also coldly snorted and took up the fight between the two of Long Jiankong.
<br><br>Almost without any trial and error, the two sides engaged in a white-hot encounter.
<br><br>Obviously they both knew very well in their hearts that among the people present, the only one who could stop them from capturing the holy relic was the other.
<br><br>Whoever defeated the other side first and rushed to the front hall would be qualified to take the holy relic.
<br><br>"Heavenly Feather!"
<br><br>After a collision, the fifth Changkong raised the feather fan in his hand, along with a quick hand seal, the fan immediately spun rapidly, and countless dark weapons were emitted within it, just like a sky full of flying feathers, attacking towards Peng Xian'er intensively.
<br><br>"Heavenly Sword!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was also not willing to show weakness, the long sword in her hand trembled, then took off her hand, dragging out a stream of light in mid-air, like a meteor that crossed the sky, immediately formed a sky of sword shadows.
<br><br>"Formation, Great Heavenly Might Pill!"
<br><br>"Formation, Blast Thunder Bomb!"
<br><br>On the side, the fifth formation of the blowing snow mountain villa two people directly made the bottom card attack, after all, the holy object current, the longer the delay will be more change.
<br><br>But the fifth formation of the two people think so, long sword empty two people do not think so?
<br><br>"Sword method, sword eternal!"
<br><br>"Sword method, heavenly sword down the mountain!"
<br><br>The two people almost at the same time as the fifth formation two people cast out their attacks, the long sword in their hands also condensed a super strong attack.
<br><br>"Ow, God bless, God bless, don't affect me!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Yu Wujie next to him was scared to death, hiding in a recessed stone crevice, praying with folded hands.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Several people's attacks finally collided together in the narrow passage.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Bang bang bang bang bang ......"
<br><br>Perhaps because of the chain reaction, after the first blast sounded, a series of sonic booms rang out.
<br><br>Subsequently, the violent qi accompanied by the remnants of sword light immediately enveloped the entire corridor.
<br><br>Many other cultivators in the corridor were affected by the ripples and were seriously injured.
<br><br>Finally, when the qi energy dissipated, the sight only regained its clarity.
<br><br>The corridor had been destroyed beyond recognition.
<br><br>"Sorry, you have lost, the holy relic is ours."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er said in an icy voice, even though several of them were also wounded, it was much milder than the few people from the Snow Blower Villa.
<br><br>After saying that, Peng Xian'er sneered, and then led the two of them, Long Jiankong, to rush towards the great hall not far away.
<br><br>"Damn, stop them quickly."
<br><br>The fifth formation shouted with a pale face.
<br><br>But while speaking a mouthful of blood spat out from his mouth, trying to go and stop them, it was obviously a little too late.
<br><br>After all, they were good at concealed weapon formations, but against the Heavenly Sword Sect, which was known for its attacks, they were obviously still lacking in combat power.
<br><br>They could only watch as the three of the Heavenly Sword Sect took the first step.
<br><br>"Two elders, one of us will take one of the three holy items, make sure to take them all." Quickly swept into the hall, looking at the altar not far ahead, Peng Xian'er shouted in an excited voice.
<br><br>"It's the holy maiden."
<br><br>The two elders hastily nodded, their eyes also shone brightly, after all, the holy relics are about to be in the bag, even the Martial Dignity can't control the excitement.
<br><br>It was closer.
<br><br>Closer.
<br><br>The hearts of the three became even more excited, and they all lifted a breath at the same time.
<br><br>"Strike together."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er shouted.
<br><br>As the voice fell, they reached the altar almost at the same time, with excited expressions on their faces, while their palms, shrouded in Yuan Qi, probed towards the location of the holy relic.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>The smiles on the faces of the three people froze, and their palms were stunned in mid-air.
