Such a powerful pressure?
<br><br>Is it a royal product?
<br><br>No.
<br><br>The Heaven-shaking Stone and the Swift Cloak were Emperor-quality treasures, but they were nowhere near this aura.
<br><br>Could it be a clan item?
<br><br>Or even a holy item?
<br><br>Demon Ling'er didn't dare to imagine further, all she knew was that the slash in front of her, which didn't seem to have the slightest bit of power, carried an unparalleled pressure that made her unable to prostrate and kneel down.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>This one was getting closer and closer, and under the powerful pressure, the stone slab under Demon Ling'er's feet had shattered, but Zhong Qing still had no intention of stopping.
<br><br>Stealing something from the martial arts school.
<br><br>Even if it is a rag, he will not show mercy. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because here, is his warmest home, without the consent of the master, no one can destroy the martial arts school, no one can take away half of the martial arts school.
<br><br>The fear in her heart is getting stronger and stronger, and Demon Ling'er's face is getting whiter and whiter, and finally under the threat of her life, she kneels to the ground with a touch of her legs.
<br><br>"I don't dare, I won't dare again."
<br><br>She hurriedly uttered in fear.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>The long knife stopped half an inch from Demon Ling'er's head, but it still caused Demon Ling'er to let out a cold sweat of shock.
<br><br>This was the first time in her life that she was so close to death.
<br><br>The humiliation of kneeling down made Demon Ling'er's heart a million times more resentful, but a bitter smile and regret spread across her face.
<br><br>Yes, since this boy was that one's disciple, she should not have looked down on him in the first place.
<br><br>Thinking of this, both hands were hurriedly handed out and presented the Swift Cloak.
<br><br>"I warn you, if you dare to steal from my martial school again, I won't show mercy next time." Zhong Qing took the rag and glared fiercely at Demon Ling'er before turning around and leaving.
<br><br>Before leaving, Ao Qing also glanced at Demon Spirit'er with disdain.
<br><br>Humph!
<br><br>A small martial spirit, but also dare to spread wild.
<br><br>Although this kid is silly, but at least is also the master's disciple, which is a martial spirit can provoke.
<br><br>It just so happens that Ao Qing's disdainful gaze was just caught by the demon spirit child, who felt even more humiliated.
<br><br>Zhong Qing is just as well, after all, is the disciple of that one.
<br><br>But herself, she was actually still despised by a dog, which made her heart unable to stand, so taking advantage of the fact that Zhong Qing had already turned around, she fiercely glared at that dog.
<br><br>"Yoo-hoo?"
<br><br>"Small sample still not convinced?"
<br><br>Ao Qing immediately came to fire, I am now at least the master's pet, anger between the forehead day-type mark slightly bright, a pillar of light immediately shone out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The demon spirit child's face changed greatly, the body cultivation flow, run out of all cultivation to resist this attack.
<br><br>But the pillar of light could not resist at all, and it fell on her chest with a devastating impact.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er flew backwards and smashed on the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood, but her eyes were shining with a strong sense of disbelief.
<br><br>She, Demon Ling'er, had actually been knocked away by a dog again?
<br><br>How, how is it possible?
<br><br>It's not right.
<br><br>This dog is not right.
<br><br>It seems to be the legendary Heaven-Devouring Demon Wolf?
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>She took a fierce breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>This martial school, just how impenetrable it was, that one herself aside, the Four Great Martial Sects of that day aside, now there was a disciple holding a Sacred Divine Weapon, and a Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf that was treated as a dog!
<br><br>Her heart was filled with regret, she should not have known that she should not have impulsively tried to take the swift cloak.
<br><br>What a mistake!
<br><br>Now it seemed that she could only carry out her plan to the end tonight, and only if she succeeded, I'm afraid she would be able to dissolve these things.
<br><br>The dinner, finally began.
<br><br>Yi Feng according to the agreement first to order a meal, and he is now rich, the place chosen naturally is not pleasant, is one of the best restaurants in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Here small bridges and flowing water, there are fireworks at night to see, thinking of the two women today to his help, bring them to this kind of place to thank it is not too much.
<br><br>After all, girls like this kind of tune.
<br><br>After fixing the location, Yi Feng sat on the bench in the front room of the restaurant and waited for the two women.
<br><br>At this time, a young man holding a paper fan came, looking at its appearance is also a partial male, he said with a smile: "Brother, can you lean to the side?"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and moved to the side.
<br><br>After the youth sat down, he greeted with a smile, "Brother, thanks, by the way you are also here to eat, right?"
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>Seeing that this is a self-acquainted buddy, Yi Feng didn't hold back, so he smiled and nodded his head.
<br><br>"Look at the appearance of brother, is waiting for a girl, right?" The youth said with a smirk.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his nose and nodded his head.
<br><br>"Fate."
<br><br>The youth arched his hand and said quietly, "Then again Wang Xuan, actually I am also waiting for the girl."
<br><br>Speaking of this, he gushed and said, "You are not aware of ah brother, it is not easy for me to ask this girl to come here for a meal ah, a whole three months to pursue her before agreeing to me, but remembering her beauty, it is worth it ah!"
<br><br>Wang Xuan's voice just fell, a tingling woman dressed in a long dress walked in.
<br><br>"Xiaoyu."
<br><br>Seeing this, Wang Xuan hurriedly shouted, while pulling Yi Feng softly introduced: "Brother, this is the girl I told you about, Rui Xiaoyu."
<br><br>"Hello Miss Rui." Yi Feng smiled and nodded his head.
<br><br>"Hello."
<br><br>Rui Xiaoyu likewise nodded towards Yi Feng and said hello.
<br><br>"Buddy, do you want to eat some together?" Wang Xuan said with a smile, while approaching Yi Feng and lowering his voice, "How about it, buddy didn't brag, right?"
<br><br>As he spoke, Wang Xuan was full of pride in his small eyes.
<br><br>"Indeed have vision, but I have to wait for someone."
<br><br>Yi Feng appreciated, this Rui Xiaoyu is indeed very beautiful, quite a big girl's temperament.
<br><br>"Okay, then buddy you continue to sit, I'll go first." Wang Xuan cast a smug little glance at Yi Feng and was just about to take Rui Xiaoyu away when a commotion was caused at the restaurant's front door.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>A woman in a long skirt with a beautiful figure, who was a palm reader at first glance, walked in.
<br><br>Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>And right after that, Demon Ling'er held a hot body, slightly raised sex g red lips likewise walked in.
<br><br>Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>The appearance of the two women, a moment of countless people's attention.
<br><br>A woman pavilion, the temperament of the dust.
<br><br>A woman's charm is still there, attracting attention.
<br><br>And Wang Xuan, who was leaving, was equally wide-eyed, and even Rui Xiaoyu was ignored by him in place for a while.
