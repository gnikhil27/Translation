After taking a shower, Yi Feng laid down directly.
<br><br>This night, he slept very comfortably.
<br><br>He dreamed that he had successfully arrived at the Central Continent and met a blind clan that recruited him as a disciple.
<br><br>After returning to Pingjiang City, he successfully obtained the qualification to build the sect, and successfully completed the system's mission, and then embarked on the path of cultivation.
<br><br>Turning clouds and rain, moving mountains and overturning seas, a beautiful woman and his double rest ......
<br><br>The day just dawned, Yi Feng packed up his things and set off.
<br><br>But when he pushed out the door and was about to go to the white floating to say goodbye, but found a beautiful figure quietly standing there, looking into the distance, not moving ......
<br><br>Seems to hear the sound, she will shift the line of sight over, revealing the delicate face, it is Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>"Gongzi is leaving so soon?" Bai Piao Piao asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Yes Miss Bai, you're up so early too!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But closer, looking at the crystal clear, crystal-like sparkling dew on Bai Piao Piao's hair, he was surprised: "Miss Bai has not slept for a year?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao smiled, did not explain, but raised his eyes expectantly and asked: "Sir, really do not stay two more days?"
<br><br>"No, I really have something to do." Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao was silent for a long time and nodded.
<br><br>"Let me see you off!"
<br><br>"En."
<br><br>The two walked side by side towards the door.
<br><br>On the way, besides simple pleasantries, there were not too many nutritious words.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Yi Feng stopped and softly thanked, "Thank you, Miss Bai, please go back, I will see you again next time when I have time."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao pursed her red lips, wanted to say something, but finally did not say, just nodded.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked away.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao looked at his back for a long time, until Yi Feng disappeared, then she returned to the courtyard.
<br><br>Although the parting is very sad, but Yi Feng's arrival, but also to meet her awakening before a wish.
<br><br>Not bad at all!
<br><br>At the entrance of the courtyard, Yun Lan and the others were waiting for her.
<br><br>"Protector Yun Lan, next I will cultivate at ease and try to awaken as soon as possible." Bai Piao Piao said expressionlessly.
<br><br>After saying that, Bai Piao Piao sat back next to the waterfall and quickly entered a state of deep silence.
<br><br>"You few come here."
<br><br>After glancing at Bai Piaoqiao, Yun Lan beckoned.
<br><br>"Present."
<br><br>Several subordinates bowed their heads.
<br><br>"You guys quickly go and prepare, and immediately rearrange the formation."
<br><br>Yun Lan ordered, "But in order to avoid the same problem, I will personally press the formation's arrangement this time."
<br><br>Several subordinates' eyes lit up and they said, "If you personally press the formation, then the formation must be foolproof!"
<br><br>"That's natural, otherwise I would be like you guys, let a mortal walk in directly?"
<br><br>Yun Lan grunted heavily and also went to prepare for the formation.
<br><br>After leaving, Yi Feng traveled all the way west.
<br><br>Because he was in East Victory, the Middle Continent was exactly to the west of him.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>The sky of East Victory was filled with a thick layer of clouds, the color was like gilded, golden.
<br><br>Most people did not think of these golden clouds, but many parts of the Immortal River Continent could not be calmed down.
<br><br>"It's the Scourge of Witch and Demon, it's the Scourge of Witch and Demon descending!"
<br><br>"This Immortal River Continent is about to be stormy, ah, countless old monsters are reviving, awakened ones are coming out in layers not to mention, I didn't expect that the Witch-Demon Scourge of the last epoch has actually reborn."
<br><br>"I'm afraid that the reincarnation of such heaven and earth treasures will cause a big fight again!"
<br><br>"Look at the movement of this vision, it should be in Eastern Victory!"
<br><br>In the black sea, a monstrous wave turned up.
<br><br>Among the lava, torrents rolled.
<br><br>Ice mountains roared and cracked in layers.
<br><br>There were countless other places that caused the same extraordinary commotion.
<br><br>"Go, bring me back the Witch Demon's Scourge."
<br><br>"No matter what the cost, the Scourge of Witch and Demon must fall into my hands."
<br><br>"The Scourge of the Witch and Demon must never fall into the hands of anyone else, whoever gets it will be able to seize the first opportunity, and I must seize it."
<br><br>"Remember, the Scourge of Witch and Demon was once a divine object of the Witch and Demon clan in the last epoch, it was usually enshrined in the altar, go to East Victory and find the altar, fetch it for me from the altar."
<br><br>In a flash, countless orders were issued from the shadows, and countless forces and experts moved out from all sides of the Immortal River Continent at the same time, converging towards East Victory.
<br><br>"Is it an earthquake?"
<br><br>Walking in the mountains, Yi Feng felt a shaking of the sky and earth in a trance.
<br><br>But it came and went as quickly as it came.
<br><br>Yi Feng was also slightly puzzled, then stopped caring and continued to drive forward.
<br><br>A day passed in a flash ......
<br><br>Yi Feng was still walking through the jungle.
<br><br>But at that moment, Yi Feng suddenly found that the line of sight in front of him opened up.
<br><br>"What a big altar!"
