 I'm going to die, I'm going to die.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's heart was stuck in his throat, his mouth was shivering while his Martial Exaltation cultivation was fully displayed, and he exerted an unprecedented speed to rush towards the Heaven Shaking Que.
<br><br>"Hurry."
<br><br>"Quickly."
<br><br>As he swept forward, Guan Yunpeng prayed with his mouth, afraid that he would be one step slower.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Along with this sword going down, the madness in Shaking Heavenly Que's body was released in full force, and a thick cold light flashed in his eyes.
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, an even more terrifying sword light came.
<br><br>This sword light is even more terrifying.
<br><br>Almost instantly, it broke the sword light of the Heaven Shaking Que and dissipated in the sky.
<br><br>"Who is it?" Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Bad for me?"
<br><br>Seeing his sword light being blocked, Shaking Heavenly Que was furious and looked towards the side with glazed eyes, but was shocked to find that it was Guan Yunpeng.
<br><br>He was just about to open his mouth to ask Guan Yunpeng why he had spoiled his good deed, but he found Guan Yunpeng rushing towards him with angry hair and smashing his fist on his face.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>How could Shaking Heavenly Que withstand the attack of today's Guan Yunpeng, his mouth immediately spat out a mouthful of blood and flew backwards, hitting the ground heavily.
<br><br>"You, what are you doing?"
<br><br>After getting up from the ground, Shaking Heavenly Que asked with a stern face in anger.
<br><br>But just as his voice fell, the furious Guan Yunpeng waved his long sword in his hand, dragging out a sword light and slashed towards him.
<br><br>Looking at this sword light, Shaking Heavenly Que was frightened and his body swept away, pulling his legs to run.
<br><br>Snort!
<br><br>A sword fell short, Guan Yunpeng more angry, palms raised, and again to the cold mane swept through.
<br><br>This cold mango, pasted to shake the sky Que head, almost was directly cut off half.
<br><br>However, Guan Yunpeng still did not want to let go of his idea, red face again a series of attacks towards shaking the sky Que cast over.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que was beaten to a pulp.
<br><br>"Old man Guan, do we have some kind of misunderstanding, what the hell is wrong with you?" Shaking Heavenly Que cried out with a sobbing face.
<br><br>"Misunderstanding?"
<br><br>"I misunderstood your whole family!"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng cursed, and while another large sword maneuver swept out, his mouth shouted, "Old man Tian Que, I ask you, are you jealous of my breakthrough to Martial Dignity and purposely harming me?"
<br><br>"Harm you?"
<br><br>Shaking Tian Que's face was full of confusion as he woefully dodged Guan Yun Peng's attack while crying and shouting, "You must have made a mistake, how could I harm you?"
<br><br>"Hmph, you still don't admit it?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's hand attacked continuously, and cursed with a gloomy face: "Tian Que old ghost, really, I Guan Yunpeng misjudged you, since we met for a thousand years, I have always regarded you as my best friend, but I didn't expect you to be such a sinister person, I had the opportunity to think of you, but I didn't expect you to harm me out of jealousy!"
<br><br>Listening to Guan Yunpeng's heartfelt words, Shaking Heavenly Que was about to cry.
<br><br>He couldn't figure out why Guan Yunpeng, who was just fine, suddenly became tit-for-tat.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on, let's talk properly!" Shake Tian Que shouted.
<br><br>"Talk nicely?"
<br><br>"I have nothing to say to you!" Guan Yunpeng Wu said with a black face.
<br><br>"You, I really don't know what's going on!" Shake the sky Que anxiously jumped to his feet, bitter face shouted: "How exactly did I offend you, you tell me ah!"
<br><br>"Well, well, since you play dumb, I'll pick you apart!"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng pointed to the martial arts school not far away and shouted: "I ask you, you know that I was given a chance in this martial arts school, know that this martial arts school is my benefactor, but you want to attack with a sword, you say you are not jealous of what is, even if you want to find death, do not take me with you, okay?"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The whole person was confused, and his voice became shivering as he asked, "You said that this is the place where the senior who gave you the chance lives?"
<br><br>"Or else what?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng shouted and cursed in anger, and looked back at the martial hall to see that there was no movement, before he was relieved.
<br><br>Fortunately.
<br><br>Fortunately, the martial arts school inside the people have not yet noticed.
<br><br>Otherwise, I'm afraid that ten lives are not enough for them to die.
<br><br>And get Guan Yunpeng's confirmation, shake the sky Que brain like a thunderstorm.
<br><br>According to the taboo he set on Ye Bei, the only place Ye Bei had stayed in Pingjiang City was here, so wasn't this the place to extort his disciple?
<br><br>How.
<br><br>How did it become a place to give Guan Yunpeng a chance?
<br><br>"You, did you make a mistake?" Shaking Heavenly Que asked incredulously.
<br><br>"I made a mistake?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng was furious and was just about to continue educating Shaking Heavenly Que when he seemed to discover something and suddenly put away the long sword in his hand and lowered his head.
<br><br>Then, an old man wearing straw shoes and carrying a hoe on his shoulder walked over in front of him.
<br><br>As they approached the two, this old man gave them a meaningful glance, and then carried the hoe and walked ahead to work in the wasteland.
<br><br>"Wu, Wu Zun?"
<br><br>Seeing this old man, Shake Tian Que felt like a fish thorn stuck in his throat, shocked half a sentence could not be said.
<br><br>However, before his horror subsided, he saw another old man carrying a shovel walking this way, gave them another meaningful look, walked to the barren land and started working.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Shaking the sky Que was even more appalled, and his voice became stuttered.
<br><br>But just about to speak, he found another old man carrying a rake head passed by their eyes and similarly ran to the ground to work.
<br><br>"Again and again, another martial djinn?"
<br><br>Walking past three Martial Dignitaries in a row, Shaking Tian Que felt cold sweat all over his body.
<br><br>When did Martial Dignitaries become so commonplace?
<br><br>And they even went to work inside the ground?
<br><br>At this time, a clanking sound came from ahead, accompanied by a foul smell, and a man in his forties or fifties picked a pair of dung buckets and walked over.
<br><br>"Not again?"
<br><br>Shake Heavenly Que's eyes snapped wide.
<br><br>Sure enough, when this dung-bearing walked past him, he felt the profound aura of the other party with incomparable intensity.
<br><br>Oh my god.
<br><br>He wailed in his heart.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here.
<br><br>The martial dwellers are like dogs?
<br><br>The first three went down to work, not to mention that the last one even picked up the dung. He had a strong illusion that he was in another fucking world.
<br><br>Shaking the sky Que was horrified, but found a side of Guan Yunpeng sparse, seems to have known.
<br><br>He carried the appalled mind, just about to ask questions, but found that a dog in front of him wandered over slowly, gave them a blank look, plopped up his hind legs, and peed away by the fecal pit.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Wave after wave of shock finally made Shake Heavenly Que breathless with horror.
<br><br>"A dog!"
<br><br>"A dog is actually a zun?"
