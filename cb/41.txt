Said.
<br><br>Yi Feng pulled out the card that the steward of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce had just given him.
<br><br>"To be honest, if it was in the past I might have broken my back for five buckets of rice, but now ......"
<br><br>"Ten thousand gold coins are really nothing to me."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng did not forget to shake the card in front of Mao Lin's eyes.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Mao Lin snorted, but the next moment, his gaze caught the card waved in Yi Feng's hand.
<br><br>That exclusive color and pattern?
<br><br>What?
<br><br>Mao Lin's face changed greatly, as the president of Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, how could he not recognize the exclusive deposit card of their arch rival, Baofeng Chamber of Commerce?
<br><br>This kind of deposit card was much the same as their Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce and was divided into different levels. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The deposit card in Yi Feng's hand, he could see at a glance, is the senior level deposit card of Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce, and with this card, at least 100,000 gold coins are stored inside.
<br><br>In other words, Yi Feng has at least one hundred thousand gold coins.
<br><br>Once he thought about this, Mao Lin's throat was like a fish thorn stuck in his throat, he couldn't say a word.
<br><br>"How is it Chairman Mao?"
<br><br>Seeing Mao Lin's stifled look, Yi Feng's eyes narrowed, revealing a pure smile as he asked.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"You win, huh." Mao Lin angry face blue, almost a mouthful of old blood spit out, after an angry grunt shouted, "Let's go."
<br><br>Looking at Mao Lin, who had left in a gray slither, Yi Feng disdainfully put away his deposit card.
<br><br>It's cool to hit your face with money.
<br><br>Of course, Yi Feng never wanted to pretend what broad, even when Mao Lin was not willing to give him the book, he would not have any problem, out of his position for the Chamber of Commerce interests first he also understood.
<br><br>But he shouldn't have, belittling Yi Feng's efforts, but also to make a hundred gold coins to humiliate him.
<br><br>Men.
<br><br>Poor can, never poor ambition.
<br><br>So this time Mao Lin came, Yi Feng naturally will not give him any good face.
<br><br>Mao Lin's face dark back to the Chamber of Commerce, and waiting for him is the entire Chamber of Commerce senior, when knowing that Mao Lin returned without success, the pressure of the crowd came head-on.
<br><br>"President, didn't you swear before that you would definitely invite that author back?"
<br><br>"Yes, last month the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce overtook us by 20% in benefits, if we continue this month, let alone the benefits this book will bring to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, the influence and fame alone will crush our Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>"If this Chamber of Commerce grading allows the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce to take the top spot, then you, Mao Lin, will be the sinner of my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>A nonchalant voice came, Mao Lin anxious, but in the face of their pressure even as president, he can not ignore, can only brace the bottom said: "just once unsuccessful, what, I have my own way."
<br><br>After the meeting, Mao Lin returned home, sitting at the top frowning.
<br><br>Finally, he shouted, "Someone, call out the lady to me."
<br><br>Not long after, Mao Yun'er, whose pretty figure was draped in a long red dress and bare jade feet, walked in and asked softly, "I wonder what Father wants to see me about?"
<br><br>"Ahem, Yun'er ah."
<br><br>Seeing Mao Yun'er arrive, Mao Lin put away the gloom on his face and said with a smile on his face, "Let me tell you a good news, the author of that Dream of the Red Chamber has been found, by the way, at the same time, let me tell you that the author of that Supreme Treasure is also the same."
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>Mao Yuner's pretty face was astonished and full of surprise.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Mao Lin nodded, and then asked, "Yun'er ah, let me ask you, do you like this person?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Mao Yun'er's pretty face was scarlet as she bowed her head and said, "Father, although I have never met him, but he has excellent literary skills and is a great writer, I think he must be a kind, elegant, gentle and flamboyant man!"
<br><br>Seeing Mao Yun'er so compliment Yi Feng, Mao Lin's face was somewhat gloomy and uncertain, but quickly collected and said gently, "Yun'er ah, what you like for father support you, and literature is indeed something charming, so have the pursuit, go ahead with confidence and boldness!"
<br><br>"Thank you father."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er pretty face excited, remembering that soon she can meet that let her longing for everyone, pretty face unknowingly filled with scarlet.
<br><br>"Okay, you go down, later I will let people will tell you his identity information and address, take time, you go to visit him!" Mao Lin instructed.
<br><br>"Yes, father, Yun'er excused herself." Mao Yun'er said softly.
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>As Mao Yun'er left, Mao Lin couldn't help but shout again.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Mao Yun'er turned back.
<br><br>"Remember to dress up pretty, and this skirt of yours is a little too long, generally the literati do not like this."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er: ...
