"Those two supreme treasures ......"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's question made Demon Ling'er's face become more ugly, and her mouth swallowed and said, "Those two treasures, have been ...... been ......"
<br><br>"Been what?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's face sank and his hoarse voice questioned.
<br><br>Knowing that it is impossible to conceal, demon spirit child looked at Ning Xuanwu, and even already guessed his that furious look, after taking a deep breath, then said heavily: "I still hope that your master is not angry, your shocking heavenly stone, has been used by that miscreant to fill the steps."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>At the sound of the words, Ning Xuanwu really exploded, his body sprouted with a thick aura and stood up, staring at Demon Ling'er and asked word by word: "You said my Heaven-shattering stone, the most precious treasure of my Xuanwu Sect, was used by him to fill the steps?"
<br><br>Looking at her master's furious appearance, Demon Ling'er's heart was uncomfortable, but that was the truth, she had to nod her head and say, "Yes, Master, not only was the Heaven-shaking Stone used by him to fill the steps, but the Swift Cloak was also ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, the nerves of the people present were raised.
<br><br>Focused on the demon spirit child.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu is even trembling body, eyes shrunk into a needle hole ...... one second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Swift cloak was also used by him as a rag to wipe the dust ......" Demon Ling'er lowered her head, and her words were almost silent at the end.
<br><br>The demon spirit child's words fell, Ning Xuanwu stunned on the spot.
<br><br>The gloomy face, the muscles can not help but twitch ......
<br><br>"Deceive people too much, deceive people too much ......"
<br><br>The violent anger in his heart exploded violently in Ning Xuanwu at this moment.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Around him, qi energy exploded violently, resounding with a series of sonic booms, and countless items were turned into powder.
<br><br>"A disciple's skeleton is left without bones ......"
<br><br>"A disciple's skeleton was used as a pet's ration ......"
<br><br>"The earth-shattering stones were used to fill the steps, and the swift cloak was used as a rag ......"
<br><br>"Ruthless, ruthless, ruthless."
<br><br>"So cruel!"
<br><br>For a while, spare Ning Xuanwu's cultivation, but also can not control the emotions at this moment, all over the body is trembling, mouth hoarse and hatred counted all the crimes of that person.
<br><br>"If my disciples really have any offense, I can forgive you for beating and scrapping them, but why do you want to humiliate them like this after leaving their bodies and bones untouched?"
<br><br>"My Xuanwu Sect's two major mountain treasures are also to be used by him to so desecrate, it is simply taking my Xuanwu Sect to rub on the ground."
<br><br>"It is bearable, what is unbearable!"
<br><br>As soon as his words fell, the entire Xuanwu Sect's crowd all emerged with a fierce light of hatred, becoming stupid and eager to go down the mountain immediately to tear the man's flesh and blood.
<br><br>"Master, this person's abomination is not only that."
<br><br>At this time, demon spirit child said hatefully again: "If I had not left a few eyes, before going through the disguise, and after various disguises, so that he did not know that I am Xuanwu Sect people, I am afraid that I will also fall into his poisonous hands."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"And ready to drive to the end?"
<br><br>The angry aura on Ning Xuanwu's body climbed another point.
<br><br>"Pass the order down, all the experts of the Xuanwu Sect will come down with me, I want to personally slaughter this villain, avenge Wudu and Wufeng, and at the same time bring back the two greatest treasures of the Xuanwu Sect." Ning Xuanwu waved his big hand and ordered at once.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The voice, resounded throughout the hall.
<br><br>The entire Xuanwu Sect had long been ignited with anger by hatred, and at this moment, Ning Xuanwu's words immediately set off the passion of the people who were eager to take revenge.
