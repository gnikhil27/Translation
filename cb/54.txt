Sending off this youth, just returned to the courtyard to sit down, outside the door again came the sound.
<br><br>Yi Feng helplessly smiled.
<br><br>Just listening to this voice he knew who it was, and walked out the door to take a look.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Is that love to play chess also dish dead middle two old man, Wu Yong Hong.
<br><br>But this time, Yi Feng was surprised that it was not just old man Wu who came, there were three old men about the same age as him.
<br><br>A little look at these three old men, Yi Feng subconsciously skimmed his mouth.
<br><br>Looked that a pleasant ah!
<br><br>One of the bones as thin as wood, dark, I do not know if it is malnutrition from childhood or what, the whole person weighs up I'm afraid not 60 pounds, the weak look, so Yi Feng are afraid to touch him, in case of a kaboom draw past, the trouble can not afford.
<br><br>Another long although a little better, but that a dress is really let people do not compliment, the whole body hanging all over do not know is chicken bones or what things, especially the thumb also whole a skull on the big trigger finger, living a set of otherworldly non-mainstream.
<br><br>As for the last one, it does not look like poor people. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>A big mouth of gold teeth, hanging a big abacus behind, the hand also whole two broken eggs in rubbing, angled head to show a look of heavenly mystery, although this dress is so a little feeling, but the temperament is still a hundred thousand miles away ah!
<br><br>Of course, the visitor is a guest.
<br><br>Although these old men are long and pleasant, but Yi Feng will not judge people by their appearance.
<br><br>But slightly surprised Yi Feng is that these few stuttering and stammering old man whole mysterious, just sent the young man who asked for directions to leave has not seen them, this all of a sudden appeared, is really strange.
<br><br>"Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong arched his hand towards Yi Feng and greeted him respectfully, apparently, after the last time, he even changed his address to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Long time no see, all come in and sit down!" Yi Feng smiled and beckoned.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong nodded excitedly, originally his heart was quite apprehensive, after all, he brought three strangers without any greeting, afraid of causing Yi Feng's displeasure, but now it seemed that Yi Feng's heart was much more broad-minded than he had imagined.
<br><br>"Go, go, go, sir invite us in."
<br><br>Thinking of this, old man Wu hurriedly pushed the other three people.
<br><br>But the three did not advance, instead, they looked at Wu Yonghong questioningly.
<br><br>When they came, they heard Wu Yonghong blowing how powerful Yi Feng was, even able to easily take out the sacred divine rake, so this way over they also believed seven or eight points, with a respectful posture to come.
<br><br>But a fucking look.
<br><br>Totally not the same thing.
<br><br>This youth, how to look, is also a mortal ah!
<br><br>"Ugh, how do you ask me to tell you guys?" Wu Yonghong said anxiously, "Not to mention that you guys can't see through his cultivation level, I can't see through it either."
<br><br>"Okay, even if it's as you said, but didn't you once say that he had a plaque containing martial intent, where is the plaque?" The bony old man asked again.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong's face was a little embarrassed, his gaze looked, and he really found the doorway empty.
<br><br>"This, this, this, maybe the gentleman took it down for now, let's not dwell on this, since the gentleman invited us in, let's hurry up and go in!" Wu Yonghong said anxiously.
<br><br>The three people still hesitated.
<br><br>What kind of people were the three of them, if this was really an expert here, it would be fine, but if it was just a mortal, how could they be qualified to be allowed to go in and take their seats?
<br><br>"You guys, you really are ......" Wu Yonghong angrily pointed at the three people said: "We have been so many years, would I still lie to you, really do not believe, go in together to see it will not know? "
<br><br>The three people smiled and looked at each other.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong indeed does not look like a lie, and the sacred divine rake in his hand can not be faked.
<br><br>Since we are here, it is not a big deal to go in and take a look.
<br><br>A group of four people, then they walked towards the martial arts school.
