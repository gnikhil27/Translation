But Yun Lang snorted coldly in his heart.
<br><br>Hostility towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Do you really think that what His Holiness gave you is some kind of souvenir, something that has eyes without pearls. Later, when you know what this jade pendant looks like, it will definitely scare your dog's guts out.
<br><br>The next two days.
<br><br>Desolate no path took Yi Feng will play a nearby poo.
<br><br>"Older brother, say, what other places do you want to go not, I will take you there."
<br><br>Desolate Trailless said with a smile.
<br><br>"There is really, but will it be a trouble old brother?" Yi Feng said shyly.
<br><br>"No trouble, you can say, even if it's heaven, as long as my brother is happy, I will take you there." Desolate Wujing smiled and said.
<br><br>"Then it will be hard for you, old brother."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng took out the map and pointed it to Desolate Wujing and said, "Old brother, this is the place." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Here?"
<br><br>As soon as he saw the place Yi Feng pointed to, Desolate Wu Jie's face turned wonderful.
<br><br>Yun Lang, on the other hand, revealed a look of disdain.
<br><br>Really don't know the sky is high, actually want to go here, and don't see if they are qualified.
<br><br>You know, this is the entrance to the Southern Sand Chaos Land.
<br><br>This is a small space of its own, and the entire Immortal River Continent is only such a place, so this place gathers evil cultivators from the entire continent, as well as prisoners wanted by the major sects.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>This is a place where fish and dragons are mixed, and even some of the major forces in Nansha do not dare to go in easily.
<br><br>You, a mortal, actually want to run in, is it because you have lived too long or what?
<br><br>"What, is there any trouble, old man?" Noticing Desolate Wuji's face, Yi Feng asked suspiciously.
<br><br>"Do you really want to go here, old brother?"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji asked solemnly.
<br><br>"Life in the world, it is always right to walk more, and look at the map standard, the entire Nansha is such a tourist attraction, always have to go to hit the card is not." Yi Feng explained with a smile.
<br><br>"Tourist attractions?"
<br><br>Desolate WuJi's face became even more complicated.
<br><br>It turns out that this old brother of his is taking this place as a tourist attraction, really do not know what to let him say good.
<br><br>"Alright, since you want to go, old brother, I will take you there."
<br><br>After thinking about it, Desolate Pathless nodded his head and agreed.
<br><br>Although in his opinion, this old brother in front of him appeared quite ignorant, but then again, he envied or valued this ignorance of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because in this kind of world, this kind of ignorance is often the most precious thing in people.
<br><br>"Then, thank you, old brother." Yi Feng thanked.
<br><br>"There is no need to be polite, old brother, because I am the person there."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing smiled, "Since I promised you, I will definitely take you on a tour of this entire ...... tourist attraction."
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>He did not pick this all out to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Because he did not want to discourage Yi Feng's enthusiasm and wanted to fulfill this wish of Yi Feng.
<br><br>And with the strength of his identity, even in this land of chaos, also confident that he can guarantee Yi Feng's safety, just as a tourist attraction, take Yi Feng around is no big deal.
<br><br>A day later.
<br><br>Desolate Trailless Edge brought Yi Feng to the entrance of the Land of Chaos.
<br><br>"It's really a ghostly work of art!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed at everything as what was presented in front of them was a straight mountain peak with a huge cave underneath it.
<br><br>"Go through this cave and you'll arrive at the place you want to go, it will definitely satisfy you." Desolate Wujing laughed.
<br><br>With that, Desolate Wuji led Yi Feng towards the cave.
<br><br>The cave was not as deep as Yi Feng imagined, but after a hundred feet, he felt a light in front of him, and a new world was presented to his eyes.
<br><br>Mountains and peaks towered, birds and flowers smelled.
<br><br>In the air, there was a faint mist floating around, making people feel relaxed and happy, with a feeling of standing in the clouds.
<br><br>No wonder this place can be treated as a tourist attraction!
<br><br>Yi Feng lamented this way.
<br><br>Desolate pathless just smiled.
<br><br>This chaotic land scenery is indeed beautiful, the entire South Sand can not find a second place, but this beauty, but contains a powerful killing machine.
<br><br>Right at this moment, he sensed that there were countless pairs of eyes staring at them.
<br><br>Among these eyes were people from several forces in the Land of Chaos, as well as some evil cultivators and scattered cultivators. Everyone who entered this place could not escape the ears of the people here.
<br><br>However, for those who enter here for the first time, it's almost the end of the line.
<br><br>Because hidden in the shadows of the evil cultivators and scattered cultivators will inevitably kill to take the treasure, and whether you can have that strength to kill to get into it, also becomes the qualification token.
<br><br>Weak people.
<br><br>Come here, only deserve to be treated as treasure-givers.
<br><br>"Go and settle these people, pay attention, do not make a commotion, so as not to scare my brother." Desolate Wuji waved his hand and transmitted a voice towards Yun Lang.
<br><br>Yun Lang nodded.
<br><br>He disappeared without a sound.
<br><br>Yun Lang did his job with confidence, so he smiled and laughed with Yi Feng, "Older brother, through this mountain range, there is a city, when you get to that city, keep you will be truly shocked."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Desolate pathless led Yi Feng through the mountains, along the way, he would also introduce some plants unique to this place, or some ghostly scenery to Yi Feng.
<br><br>This made Yi Feng feel very satisfied, feeling that this trip was really worthwhile.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Just the sun shining high in the mountain, gradually became gloomy, and then slowly rose fog.
<br><br>Desolate pathless sharp eyes observed the surroundings, did not find anything unusual, because the fog in the mountain is not considered special.
<br><br>But what made him frown was that Yun Lang had been there for so long and hadn't returned yet.
<br><br>This is very unwarranted.
<br><br>Because with Yun Lang's strength to solve these people, it does not take much effort at all.
<br><br>"Older brother, that guard of mine just went out and hasn't come back yet, wait for him here." A bad feeling inexplicably appeared in the heart of Desolate Wuji, so he said towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"No problem, it's good to wait for a while."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, just as he was also tired of walking.
<br><br>A few people in a row, waiting in the same place.
<br><br>But what Desolate Wujing didn't expect was that after waiting for a long time, Yun Lang still didn't come back.
<br><br>This made Desolate Wuji's face finally turned grave.
<br><br>An unpredictable crisis slowly emerged from the heart.
<br><br>Because Yun Lang to do his business he is clear, so long has not returned, is bound to be out of what big change.
<br><br>In the end.
<br><br>What is going on?
