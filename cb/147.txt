Looking at the appearance of Lu Dasheng carrying dung flying, Yi Feng then revealed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>"Sir, I am really sorry, I brought someone privately without your consent, please redeem me." After seeing that Yi Feng had finished his work, the old ancestor of the green hill hastily approached apprehensively and apologized, "But I was forced to do so, it's really ......"
<br><br>"It's okay!"
<br><br>"Just come, it's no big deal."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said, and did not take this matter to heart, although I do not know where Lu Qingshan knew such a person from, but he, an honest man is certainly not a match for this hobgoblin.
<br><br>Even to say that Yi Feng also thanked Lu Qingshan it, after all, so good dung player where to find?
<br><br>Seeing this, Lu Qingshan suddenly breathed a sigh of relief, while revealing a grateful smile.
<br><br>And he also can't help but feel Mr. brilliant.
<br><br>The tang of the first pill refiner in Nansha in such a place to carry the dung, this lesson is afraid than kill Lu Dasheng more unpleasant.
<br><br>Especially looking at the dung pit full of dung, the old ancestor of Castle Peak could not help but cast a pitying gaze towards Lu Dasheng.
<br><br>"By the way old brother, can you do me a favor?" Yi Feng asked again in a hurry. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Please speak, sir." The old ancestor of Mount Qing hurriedly said.
<br><br>"My disciple Zhong Qing is still lying injured in the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce, can you help me to bring him back from the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce." Yi Feng hurriedly said, "Because I have to decoct medicine here, I really can't take time off."
<br><br>"Don't worry, sir, I'll get right on it."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan hastily agreed and started to rush towards the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>"I'll clean you up later."
<br><br>And Yi Feng did not dare to delay, after glaring fiercely at the skeleton lying in the corner and kicking it heavily, he hurriedly walked into the kitchen and started to decoct medicine for Zhong Qing.
<br><br>And after Yi Feng left, the skeleton slipped away and was gone.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>When Old Ancestor Qingshan rushed to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, he found that his disciple Luo Lanxue was also here.
<br><br>"What are you doing here, Xue'er?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan asked.
<br><br>"Master, some days ago Uncle Yin informed me that Mr.'s disciple is here to recuperate, how can we be ambiguous about such a big event, so my disciple has been taking care of Mr.'s disciple these days."
<br><br>While speaking, Luo Lanxue brought the Old Ancestor Qingshan into a luxurious room.
<br><br>In the room, Zhong Qing was lying with a ghastly pale face.
<br><br>And besides Luo Lanxue taking care of it, there were half a dozen pavilion girls serving Zhong Qing, massaging, wiping their faces, busy as they were.
<br><br>"One word, proper!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan looked at Luo Lanxue with appreciation.
<br><br>This disciple is worthy of being his most beloved disciple, deep in his path!
<br><br>"But Master, the situation of Duke Zhong Qing's injury is not too good!" Luo Lanxue said worriedly, "These days, Uncle Yin has invited almost all the famous doctors in the city over, but they are all helpless!"
<br><br>"But the people who hurt him are only the group from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, so it's reasonable to say that there's nothing we can do?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan also frowned.
<br><br>This was also what he couldn't understand, he had always thought that Zhong Qing was a heaven defying genius, but after being injured by the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, it proved that this was not the case.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was not a genius, even a waste material that even had no cultivation, even the meridians were blocked.
<br><br>But if it is really a waste material, with the kind of Tongtian great power of Mr., how would he take it as a disciple?
<br><br>This is very contradictory.
<br><br>"Forget it, these are not things you and I can speculate on, let's bring Prince Zhong Qing back to Mister first!" Old Ancestor Qing Shan said solemnly, "Mister will personally cure Duke Zhong Qing, don't worry!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue nodded and hurriedly called for a car to be sent.
<br><br>"Disciple ah, drink this bowl of medicine, to ensure that you have no problems."
<br><br>Yi Feng beat the bushel fan and gave Zhong Qing a decoction of medicine while chanting confidently in his mouth.
<br><br>He still has absolute confidence in this aspect of seeing patients, at least it is a realm that is comparable to God, and still has a proven track record.
<br><br>Remember that year, the East Street A flower has been unable to conceive a child, Yi Feng gave her a pair of drugs, not only conceived a twin, the remaining dregs of the medicine was his family that the old sterilized sow gnawed, wow gave birth to eight piglets, healthy only three months to her piggy bank top a big hole.
<br><br>Even Yi Feng sometimes think, if you do not open a martial arts school, get a medical school, I'm afraid that has long been developed.
<br><br>Not long after, the old ancestor of Castle Peak and Luo Lanxue came back with Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't have to be polite with them, and after putting Zhong Qing in the room, he fed the medicine he had just decocted to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Cough cough cough!"
<br><br>Not long after the medicine was fed, Zhong Qing, who had been unconscious, let out a violent coughing sound, apparently having awakened.
<br><br>On the side, Old Ancestor Qingshan and Luo Lanxue revealed their admiration.
<br><br>This medicine, it's divine!
<br><br>It is worthy of being a gentleman.
<br><br>Unable to help, he put his arm on Zhong Qing's meridian.
<br><br>But once he put his arm on it, it immediately made his eyes widen and his eyes were astonished.
<br><br>He was surprised to find that Zhong Qing's body was undergoing earth-shaking changes, and was actually opening up a whole complete meridian at an incredible pace.
<br><br>And the structure of this meridian was completely different from the structure in their bodies, it was a completely new meridian structure.
<br><br>"This, this this this, this is not a human meridian ......"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Zhong Qing's mouth shivered as he murmured, while his brain spun frantically, trying to find information about this meridian.
<br><br>After a long time, his eyes suddenly lit up!
<br><br>Also at the same time as his eyes lit up, his body couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>Because he finally remembered in his memory, what exactly this kind of meridian structure belongs to ......
