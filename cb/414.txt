Yi Feng sat in the broken temple undyingly studied.
<br><br>An hour and two hours have passed .......
<br><br>Yi Feng will be able to think of the effect of all the thought, the egg pain found that this son of a bitch halo, in addition to the ability to make a burst of light on the head, no egg use.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Hard to pursue up, there is still a little role.
<br><br>At least, with this beam of light, summer walking at night when not afraid to step on snakes.
<br><br>The empty joy of a Yi Feng sat down on the ground in dismay, and began to study the system again.
<br><br>After all, he thought, didn't the system just upgrade?
<br><br>After the upgrade, it can always bring him some new functions, right?
<br><br>But then Yi Feng suddenly remembered that the system rewarded him with a skeleton Ben Wei, a slowly, and the light that can be summoned at any time, is to teach him the qin, chess, calligraphy and painting things.
<br><br>In addition, it is possible to detect other people's talent. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In other words, the whole system functional role, but also to detect the talent of others a little.
<br><br>So, the function itself is this kind of bird, even if upgraded, the upper limit can be more how much?
<br><br>But at least have to try.
<br><br>Maybe after the system upgrade, the function of detecting talent will be upgraded, such as in addition to talent, can also monitor the cultivation of others, or other secrets?
<br><br>With such a thought, Yi Feng once again walked out of the temple door.
<br><br>Just when he was about to look for a target to detect, six figures swept by in the sky over the Guan Tong City.
<br><br>Although I do not know what they are, but can fly is definitely a cultivator, so Yi Feng directly targeted the six of them to open the detection.
<br><br>"Ding: lazy detection."
<br><br>After a moment of waiting, a voice came from the system.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Lazy detection?"
<br><br>As soon as he heard the system's voice, Yi Feng was dumbfounded, shivering his lips and brewing countless curses in his heart.
<br><br>He had thought that after the system upgrade, this only function would also follow the upgrade upgrade, but he never expected such a result.
<br><br>The system is not even bothered to detect?
<br><br>"Kam."
<br><br>"Dumb system."
<br><br>"I rub your whole family."
<br><br>The angry Yi Feng wanted to pull out the dog system and beat it up, but there was nothing he could do.
<br><br>Anger nowhere to vent his anger, he had to take out a knife, stabbed the half of the old sow placed on the butcher's bench next to him.
<br><br>Enough to stab more than eighty knives, and only then stopped.
<br><br>Instead, when he left, he watched the female butcher, who was even fatter than the old sow, lift the pig-killing knife before he cut half a tael of meat, dropped a gold coin with a corner missing, and cursed as he left.
<br><br>Six people swept through the sky, their eyes sweeping the entire Guan Tong City.
<br><br>"How come there's no sign of the senior yet?" The Patriarch of the Hengtian Sword Fast couldn't help but ask towards Night Yi, "Miss Night, did you not miss it?"
<br><br>"There shouldn't be, I remember senior's appearance and back clearly, if I saw him, I would definitely recognize him at a glance." Night Yi shook her head and said.
<br><br>"Then we have flown countless circles in Guan Tang City, and still haven't found him, what's going on?" The Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch said with a frown.
<br><br>"Yes, could it be that this senior doesn't want to see us?"
<br><br>The Taiyi Valley Patriarch couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"I guess it could be, it's too easy for the six of us to find someone, unless that senior doesn't want us to find him, there's no way we can't find him."
<br><br>The Canghai Mountain Patriarch said.
<br><br>"That senior is easy-going, I don't think it's deliberately not wanting to see us." Night Yi shook her head and guessed.
<br><br>"Then why is it?" Night Energy asked.
<br><br>"I remembered." Suddenly, Night Yi hurriedly said, "When I met senior, that senior kept calling himself a mortal and asked me not to call him senior, that is to say, he simply did not want to reveal his identity, and our flying around in such a big way obviously refuted with senior's concept!"
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"Then quickly, quickly, quickly, let's quickly land down."
<br><br>When the crowd heard the words, they suddenly realized, and hurriedly landed from the sky, while converging their aura.
<br><br>Just then, the jade slips of the four patriarchs lit up at the same time.
<br><br>After reading the message in the jade slip, the four looked at each other and nodded intently at the same time.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The four people got the same message.
<br><br>"What's wrong, did something happen?" Night Energy couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"There is a heaven and earth vision coming from above the First Line Valley, if the guess is good, it should be a heaven and earth treasure appearing." The patriarch of Taiyi Valley said.
<br><br>"Not bad, this time the heaven and earth vision is very turbulent, many hidden forces have emerged, I'm afraid that all four of us will have to go over." Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch said rather reluctantly.
<br><br>"Big matters are important, you guys go ahead."
<br><br>Night Energy looked up at the north, and sure enough, the sky in that direction was greatly illuminated.
<br><br>Although the four did not want to leave, they had no choice, but before they left, they all pulled Night Energy and gave a solemn explanation.
<br><br>"After we finish our business, we will come back immediately."
<br><br>"The matter of searching for the seniors will be left to you for the time being."
<br><br>"If you find seniors, first help us say hello."
<br><br>"When you get familiar with seniors, remember to introduce us!"
<br><br>"Remember, always remember!"
<br><br>The four of them took one step and turned back three times, chanting for a long time, before flying in the direction of the First Line Valley.
<br><br>"Father, how should we look for senior?"
<br><br>After the four people left, Night Yi couldn't help but ask towards Night Neng.
<br><br>"Sincerity of heart is spirit, since senior has the kind of heavenly means you said, then if he doesn't refuse to see us, I think we will see him soon." Night Energy said softly.
<br><br>Night Yi nodded her head.
<br><br>The father and daughter started to set off, searching aimlessly.
<br><br>"Girl, what a coincidence."
<br><br>The two had just walked past a street corner when a familiar voice came from the side.
