The big black bird chirped proudly, then turned into a black stream of light and instantly disappeared.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>He arrived at the barrier between the two realms of the Immortal River Continent and the Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Just in time.
<br><br>There were two experts from the Immortal River Continent who had crossed the barrier and entered the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>"Since the continent lord has punished you inferior humans for not being able to ascend, then no matter what change has happened, then you are not qualified to enter the immortal realm."
<br><br>The cold gaze swept a glance at those two cultivators of the Immortal River Continent from above, and the sharp claws suddenly slashed across the sky.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>The two people did not even have time to see how this immortal world is really me, and already flew into oblivion.
<br><br>And black feather did not look at it again.
<br><br>After all, in his eyes, it was just two human immortals who had just arrived in the immortal world. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The existence of ants in general is not worthy of his eyes.
<br><br>The company's main goal is to provide a high quality service to its customers.
<br><br>After a short teleportation, Black Feather had already arrived at the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>"It's really weak!"
<br><br>"This low level realm can simply be destroyed with a wave of the hand."
<br><br>"Yo."
<br><br>"There's a little reptile?"
<br><br>He glanced down and was finding a Demon Emperor level demonic beast staring at him.
<br><br>"Little crawler that doesn't know the sky is high!"
<br><br>He sneered disdainfully, his sharp mouth slowly opened, and a chirping sound that shook the mountains and forests, accompanied by a thick pressure of might, came out in all directions.
<br><br>And under his scream, the entire Shade Mountain Range fell into extreme chaos.
<br><br>Both senior demonic beasts and ordinary beasts felt a trembling in their souls.
<br><br>It was a qualitative pressure.
<br><br>And the demon emperor below bore the brunt of it, its body prostrated on the ground, its face filled with fear.
<br><br>"Shit!"
<br><br>"What the heck, so much noise?"
<br><br>And at the bottom of a certain tree.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was preparing to rest and rest, opened his eyes, looked up at the sky, and an impatient voice came out.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"An ant-like thing, also worthy of appearing to obstruct my eyes?"
<br><br>Black feather teasingly looked at the prostrate demon emperor.
<br><br>With a high posture, a high-pitched chirping sound once again emitted from his mouth.
<br><br>Under this chirp, the prostrate Martial Emperor finally couldn't withstand the pressure and directly exploded into a rain of blood in place.
<br><br>"Screaming again?"
<br><br>And its sleepy Yi Feng immediately stormed away, then lifted his bow and arrow and rushed over following the sound.
<br><br>"Got!"
<br><br>"I let you scream, since you like to scream so much, I just happen to catch you back, to the old me off the back of the mountain desperately screaming."
<br><br>"It just so happens that your scream is quite loud and clear, every day to a few, I'm afraid the average person will really be fooled, think I that back mountain really shut what big demon beast."
<br><br>"Two birds with one stone."
<br><br>Finished, Yi Feng looked up at the big black bird hovering in the sky, pulled the bow directly an arrow shot out.
<br><br>Full of disdain black feather looked at the ground into a rain of blood demon emperor, then ready to leave.
<br><br>But at this time.
<br><br>A whistling sound suddenly sounded.
<br><br>After that, he saw an arrow shot towards him.
<br><br>"Someone actually attacked me?"
<br><br>"That's ridiculous."
<br><br>"This kind of attack from the lower realms really thinks that it can't hurt me, even if this Immortal stood here and didn't move, it wouldn't hurt me at all."
<br><br>He laughed coldly and let the bow and arrow attack come.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>His body trembled violently, frozen in mid-air.
<br><br>At the same time that proud head, finally incredibly lowered, and then opened that sharp mouth wide in surprise.
<br><br>Because.
<br><br>This arrow hit.
<br><br>Not only that, but it also directly broke his defense and pierced into his body.
<br><br>Blood, clattering down.
<br><br>"Sloppy."
<br><br>He opened his mouth, then he found himself weak, no longer able to control the power in his body, like a bird with broken wings, planted from midair to the ground.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The huge body smashed to the ground, as if it had caused a small earthquake.
<br><br>He was lying on the ground staring at the ground with big eyes and a strong look of horror in his eyes.
<br><br>Him.
<br><br>An immortal beast of the Immortal Realm, an existence that followed the Green Jade Immortal Continent Lord around, had actually flipped over in this lower realm?
<br><br>What the hell was going on here?
<br><br>Just when he couldn't figure out all of this, a figure slowly walked towards him.
<br><br>"Was it this person who moved against him?"
<br><br>Damned underclassmen, how dare they make a move on him.
<br><br>No matter how he did all this, in Black Feather's heart, Yi Feng had already become a dead man.
<br><br>"Damn it!"
<br><br>Black Feather gritted his teeth and opened his mouth to roar out.
<br><br>But he just opened his mouth, a stick knocked on his head.
<br><br>"Damn you still scream, there is no end to it, right?"
<br><br>Yi Fengwu black face drink, and then added a stick.
