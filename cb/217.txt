But did not expect that, no matter how hard Yang Mu, still only in return for the light voice of Master Wang.
<br><br>"Bullying the old man is not a good style!"
<br><br>Once his voice fell, the cloudy gaze suddenly moved, hunched and thin body, a fierce outbreak of absolute pressure.
<br><br>The first to bear the brunt of Yang Mu before he had time to react, his chest tightened, a mouthful of fresh blood spit out.
<br><br>At the same time the body felt subjected to the pressure of a heavenly might.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Both legs went weak, and even with the strength of Martial Exalted, he could not withstand this kind of pressure, and directly knelt on the ground.
<br><br>The people behind him, such as Yun Xian Que and the Fifth Longkong, were no exception, and instantly felt a chill down their backs, and were shocked by the huge pressure of might and prostrated on the ground.
<br><br>The prostrate crowd was dripping with cold sweat.
<br><br>I never thought that this Wang Da-ji actually hid so deep.
<br><br>Just now the outbreak of that pressure, not half a point lower than the previous Jiang Yu, and Jiang Yu is a step short of the Martial Emperor ...... first domain name m.biquxs. com

<br><br>The realm is a call out!
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>The crowd straight feel breathless.
<br><br>This kind of legendary big brother, but they are in reality for the first time in person to see.
<br><br>Lightly subdued this group of people, Master Wang returned to his original appearance, propped up his cane and slowly sat down at the table.
<br><br>Picked up the boiling water on the table, brewed a pot of tea and tasted it carefully.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Your grandfather is still your grandfather.
<br><br>The grandfather did not send a message, the people kneeling on the ground trembling, the atmosphere did not dare to breathe a breath.
<br><br>"What to do?"
<br><br>A few people cold sweat, the fifth long air towards a few people voice transmission said.
<br><br>"Do not be impulsive, see the meaning of this one, should not do anything to us, otherwise we would not have survived until now." The fifth formation quietly surveyed the tea-drinking grandfather and transmitted voice towards the crowd.
<br><br>"The fifth elder is right, as long as we are sincere, this one should let us go." Yang Mu transmitted, "It's just that the idea of wanting to buy this house, I'm afraid it's only going to end here."
<br><br>"That's not the way to say it."
<br><br>The fifth formation transmitted voice: "This time it is our bad luck to kick the iron plate, the big deal is that we will change the house then."
<br><br>"The fifth elder is right, as far as I know, sir diagonally opposite the pork seller Pork Rong is also quite suitable, and I heard that this Pork Rong family is in difficulty, if we give him enough compensation, should sell the house." Yun Xian Que transmitted a voice analysis.
<br><br>"Good, then let's do it, after this old man releases us, we will go to Pork Rong's place."
<br><br>The people made up their minds.
<br><br>Just then, a knock sounded on the door behind them.
<br><br>"Who is it!"
<br><br>Grandpa Wang put down the teapot, propped up his cane and walked slowly, then opened the door.
<br><br>"Oh, it's you, Porky Rong, come in and sit down!"
<br><br>When Grand Master Wang saw the visitor, he smiled, then turned back to the table and poured a cup of tea for the visitor.
<br><br>But Yun Xian Que and others were violently shocked in their hearts.
<br><br>This simply said pork rong, pork rong arrived ah!
<br><br>The crowd will open their eyes over, only to see Pork Rong full of big scruff, stout, even in this winter only wore a rough vest, bare-chested appearance will be exuberant chest hair exposed.
<br><br>At the same time, he carried a large string of ribs in his left hand and a pig-killing knife in his right hand, while his bloodthirsty aura directly brought a heavy pressure on Yun Xian Que and others.
<br><br>Of course, what appalled them the most was the pig-killing knife in Pork Rong's hand, which invisibly revealed a compelling aura that made their scalps tingle.
<br><br>It was at least the existence of a holy product.
<br><br>"We, we're afraid we're going to miss the mark again!" Looking at this appearance of Pork Rong, the fifth formation instantly revealed a bitter and fearful smile.
<br><br>"Yes, looking at this one, I'm afraid that he is even stronger than this grand master by a few points." The corners of Yun Xian Que's mouth were similarly filled with bitterness.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>The crowd was filled with sadness.
<br><br>This one is stronger than the other existence, actually in this small Pingjiang City pile up, casually proposed to go to a, are in the South Sand put a fart can array dead a large number of existence.
<br><br>"How come you have time to come today?" Grandpa Wang asked with a smile.
<br><br>"This is not you an old man said want to eat ribs, this is not today to sell the remaining ribs, to bring you in." Pork Rong let out a big laugh, threw the string of ribs on the table and shouted, "Old man get a cutting board, I'll chop it up for you."
<br><br>"Okay, thanks for your hard work."
<br><br>Master Wang got up and brought a cutting board and handed it to Porky Rong, who took the cutting board while chopping the ribs, while looking towards Yun Xian Que and others and asked, "Right old man, what are these people doing?"
<br><br>"Alas, these few people see my old man alone and lonely, bullying my old man!" Grandpa Wang said with a sigh.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>A fierce aura emerged from Porky Rong's body, and his tiger-like pupils immediately fell on Yun Xian Que and the others.
<br><br>"These little brats actually bully the old man? That can't be spared!" While speaking, Pork Rong slashed the ribs in his hand.
<br><br>Seeing this, kneeling on the ground, the fifth long air and other people's faces changed greatly, especially looking at pork rong that hands of killing knives fell knife after knife, the crowd is scared, eyelids jumping.
<br><br>Fifth Changkong is even scared teeth chattering, crying and shouting: "senior senior, two seniors, we are wrong, we have eyes, spare life spare life ah!"
<br><br>"Spare life, how come you didn't know to spare life when you bullied the old man?"
<br><br>Pork Rong will be in the hands of the ribs fiercely fell on the cutting board, came over a hand to lift up the fifth Changkong, with a chilling pig killing knife back on his neck two pull back and forth.
<br><br>"Ah ah ah, I'm dead, dead dead, I was wrong, ah ah ah ah ......"
<br><br>The fifth long air scared body shivered, mouth crumbling cried out.
<br><br>"Forget it, a few little brats but, throw out even." Master Wang could not hear the pig-killing screams, put down the tea cup waved his hand and shouted.
<br><br>"Get out!"
<br><br>Pork Rong tiger eyes glared and shouted.
<br><br>Seeing that, Fifth Longkong and the others fled like they were on the verge of an amnesty, and immediately fled with their butts in the air.
<br><br>After the people escaped from the tiger's mouth, they did not know what to do for a while.
<br><br>"What next, go back?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que asked with a frown.
<br><br>"Go, we must go."
<br><br>Fifth Longkong red face, reluctantly growled: "This pig killer and that old man look like us, only earlier than us, must also be blessed by the gentleman to be so powerful, go, here is another open beef noodle restaurant, I go to talk."
<br><br>Saying that, he went into the store behind that beef stall.
