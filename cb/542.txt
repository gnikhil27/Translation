This time, the drop of qi was an unprecedented blow to the king of the world of extermination and the cloud top.
<br><br>It took them a long time to get over it.
<br><br>But before they could figure out exactly why this had happened, a subordinate hurriedly came to report.
<br><br>"Your Majesty, Lord Destruction, that Wu Tian, that Wu Tian has come back to life!"
<br><br>"Not only has he come back to life, according to the scouts, his strength seems to be much stronger than before, it seems that he has awakened an immortal physique."
<br><br>"And once again, he has launched a fierce attack on my Genting Empire, and has already taken down ten cities in a row!"
<br><br>When this news came, it almost didn't make the two people jerk over again.
<br><br>Especially the Genting ruler almost didn't spit out a mouthful of old blood.
<br><br>And the two finally understood why the qi had changed like this, it was still because of Wu Tian.
<br><br>Immortal physique, it's not that they hadn't heard of it.
<br><br>This is a kind of physique that exists in legends, a true pride of the heavens, also understand that people with this physique will be more powerful every time they die and come back to life. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"No wonder, I said how a small empire's ruler, how can he have such a great influence of qi, it turns out that he has this kind of physique." The Genting king narrowed his eyes and a gloomy voice came out.
<br><br>"Hmph, so what, this person must die, this lost qi must be salvaged back." Destruction said with a face full of morose coldness.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>"Although he has an immortal physique, he is not truly immortal, as long as the power attacking him is strong to a certain level, it will still be able to make him immortal!" Genting Empire drank.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Half a month had passed in a flash.
<br><br>During this half month, the news of Wu Tian Empire's attack on Genting Empire had spread throughout the entire Ling Xu Realm.
<br><br>The entire Lingxu Realm did not expect that this tiny Wu Tian Empire would dare to attack the Genting Empire.
<br><br>At the same time, during this half month period.
<br><br>Destruction struck out once more against Wu Tian.
<br><br>And this time, unlike last time, he used his strongest attack and directly smashed Wu Tian's body into pieces.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was that Wu Tian once again came to life, and his strength was even stronger than before.
<br><br>As Wu Tian became stronger and stronger, the entire border of the Genting Empire was gathered into the pocket of the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>Also because of the rising strength of Wu Tian, the great enemy, the Qi Immortal Pillar once again declined.
<br><br>This made the Exterminator and the Genting kingdom monarch sit up even more.
<br><br>Thinking that it might not be enough power to kill Wu Tian, so this time the World Exterminator and the Genting Kingdom Monarch teamed up to personally take action and launched an ultra-high intensity strike against Wu Tian.
<br><br>The two people's various skills bombarded Wu Tian's body furiously.
<br><br>But just when the two were full of joy, thinking that they had gotten rid of their great enemy, Wu Tian's body reorganized once again, accompanied by a surge in strength to resurrect once again.
<br><br>"What to do, what to do?"
<br><br>Sitting next to the Qi Immortal Pillar, looking at the few Qi fortunes, the two men were anxious.
<br><br>To Wu Tian, they were pressed to not dare to make a move anymore.
<br><br>Because they were afraid that if they killed a few more times, both of them would not be Wu Tian's match.
<br><br>"How do I know what to do?"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch frantically rubbed his hair and growled, "Just yesterday, the messenger sent a message asking how the matter of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar was going, and I didn't even dare to tell him the truth."
<br><br>"Yes, this definitely can't be told the truth, if the messenger knows that in a few months' time, instead of making the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar grow a little, we have dropped so much, he will definitely kill us." Extinction said with the same ugly expression.
<br><br>"So now, it's better to think of a countermeasure as soon as possible!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler said with a shriveled face.
<br><br>"I think, since we can't do anything about Wu Tian for the time being, let's just ignore him for the time being, anyway, your Genting Empire has a large family, so he won't be able to hit the Imperial City even if he fights for half a year." Destruction said, "So we'd better put our minds on our qi, first our qi will make up for it, when it's almost recovered, then we'll talk to the messenger and ask him to take action himself and destroy this Wu Tian."
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch gritted his teeth.
<br><br>Although they were unwilling to let Wu Tian go for the time being, but now that the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar looked like this, they didn't even have the guts to ask the messenger to help.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>It seems that they can only do as the extinction so say.
<br><br>Saying that, the Cloud Top king took out the Guidance Heavenly Book, and then frowned.
<br><br>"In the guidance, other things that can increase qi are not easy, need to be properly laid out, in short, need quite a lot of time ah!" Genting kingdom monarch sighed.
<br><br>Extinction frowned slightly as well.
<br><br>They didn't have so much time to wait for the layout.
<br><br>Better, to make up for the Qi before the messenger's next descent.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Just as the two were fretting, the Cloud Top king suddenly remembered something and hurriedly said, "Since we can make up for the Qi luck lost because of Wu Tian by killing him, then the Yellow Sky Giant Beast from before?"
<br><br>Extinction was also a little bit clear, and his eyes lit up fiercely.
<br><br>Although it was said that Wu Tian later had an accident, but that was because Wu Tian had an immortal body and was able to die once and be stronger.
<br><br>But the yellow sky giant beast does not have an immortal body.
<br><br>This killed killed ah.
<br><br>As soon as Huang Tian died, then the qi lost because of Huang Tian, is not able to make up for it back?
<br><br>This is a great deal of luck.
<br><br>And it is much easier to operate than to rearrange other things.
<br><br>"Good, I will immediately send down an order to all agencies to search for Huang Tian's whereabouts."
<br><br>"But whenever we find Huang Tian down, the two of us will personally take action and kill him."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Perdition nodded solemnly.
<br><br>As soon as this solution was thought of, the gloom on the two men's faces finally cleared up quite a bit.
