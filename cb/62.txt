"What?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's red lips opened wide.
<br><br>Never thought that the reason Ning Xuanwu wanted her to stay was this.
<br><br>"I know that this is very difficult for you ......," Ning Xuanwu said in a serious tone, "but this is about the future of our Xuanwu Sect, and the entire lifeline of the Xuanwu Sect is clutched in your hands. "
<br><br>"And then again, if you can really become his woman, in fact, it is not wrong for you, after all, he has the lowest Martial Saint cultivation, you do not always admire the strong?"
<br><br>After saying that, Ning Xuanwu turned his questioning gaze towards Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's red lips clenched as she thought about what Ning Xuanwu had said.
<br><br>This was not without reason.
<br><br>Not to mention whether he was a Martial Emperor or not, just being a Martial Saint was enough to make countless people submissive, and if not for these incidents, that youth would have been the object of his worship and pursuit, Demon Ling'er.
<br><br>And if she really became that young man's woman, then she demon Ling'er certainly also rose to the top of the boat, not to mention becoming a human being, Xuanwu Sect is naturally the beneficiary.
<br><br>"Master, I'm not unwilling, just that he can really look at me?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's face became unconfident.
<br><br>If it is in front of other people, take a man but to her natural beauty in addition to her uncommon charm power, naturally is no longer words to catch.
<br><br>But a minimum cultivation is a martial arts saint's expert, what kind of woman does he want, why would he look at him demon Ling'er it?
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu also frowned.
<br><br>But the matter has come to this, and there is no other way, he can only comfort: "Ling'er, my master believes in your means, success is in the hands of man to plan things in the sky, you can definitely do it."
<br><br>"Okay, okay ......"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er suddenly felt a thousand pounds of guts on her body.
<br><br>But this task was dangerous and rewarding at the same time, and it also stirred up the fighting spirit, and anticipation in her heart.
<br><br>Soon after, Ning Xuanwu and others had rushed back towards the Xuanwu Sect, Demon Ling'er did not act rashly at first, but sneaked into Pingjiang City to hide her cultivation and took up residence.
<br><br>......
<br><br>In a strict hall.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Mount Qing's face was flickering with intense anger, and the veins on his arms were exposed under his extreme anger.
<br><br>He just came out of the gate, he heard Luo Lanxue report to him, last time in the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce Yu Wu Jie did not know what to do to Mr..
<br><br>This matter, can be tolerated?
<br><br>"Third Elder, you must give me an explanation for this matter." Old Ancestor Qing Shan was emitting a compelling aura and looked at an old man at the bottom and said in a deep voice: "Yu Wu Jie, I will kill him, no, I will lynch him."
<br><br>As soon as he heard what the Castle Peak Elder said, the third elder's face changed greatly and he directly knelt down to the ground.
<br><br>"Patriarch, calm down, please give Wu Jie a chance, I am willing to pay whatever the old man has to pay." The Third Elder said with an anxious face, "I'm not going to hide from you, Sovereign, but besides being my disciple, Wu Jie has another layer of identity."
<br><br>"An illegitimate son, right?"
<br><br>Old Patriarch Qing Shan said in a cold voice.
<br><br>"So you, Sovereign, you know all about it." The Third Elder lowered his head with an embarrassed face.
<br><br>"Hmph, if he wasn't your illegitimate son, would I still be here to talk to you more?" Old Patriarch Qing Shan said in a cold voice, "Otherwise, that Yu Wujie would have been a dead dog by now."
<br><br>"Thank you for the patriarch's enlightenment." The Third Elder knocked his head heavily on the ground and begged for mercy, "I beg you, Patriarch, to bypass Wu Jie's life for the sake of the old man's service to the sect all these years."
<br><br>"I am willing to bear Wu Jie's punishment for him."
<br><br>After saying that, his face was ruthless, his qi energy waved down, an arm hurriedly and sharply landed in front of the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, then, with a miserable white face, he looked at the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak and said sincerely, "If the Old Ancestor feels that it is not enough, I am willing to break another arm!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Why are you doing this?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan flashed out, and two qi energy fell on the third elder, helping him seal his bleeding meridians.
<br><br>"Please, Patriarch, be enlightened." The Third Elder continued to kowtow.
<br><br>"Alas, it's just that."
<br><br>The old ancestor shrugged off his head, the third elder although some enrichment, but these years really gave a lot for the Castle Peak Sect, have come to this point, if he is still not open grace, I am afraid that really died in front of him.
<br><br>Moreover, he is so attached to this Yu Wujie, also has the relationship of the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>When the Castle Peak Gate and another gate war, the third elder three days of battle, seriously wounded and dying, although saved, but the Yang Gate was destroyed, no longer have the power to pass on to the next generation.
<br><br>Just one son, he is certainly to protect.
<br><br>"Thank you for the patriarch's kindness." The third elder kowtowed his head in thanks.
<br><br>"It is not that I am enlightened, but that gentleman did not take this matter to heart." The old ancestor of Green Mountain said in a deep voice: "Otherwise, not to mention you, the whole Green Mountain Sect can't protect him, but I warn you, the people under you had better give me good discipline."
<br><br>"In addition, since you know the identity of the gentleman, but absolutely must not leak half a word to the public, if because of your leakage, disturbing his clear cultivation, then you will give me thanks yourself!"
<br><br>"Yes, Sovereign."
<br><br>The third elder hurriedly retreated and went through a series of formalities before releasing Yu Wujie.
<br><br>After being released, Yu Wujie sent someone to inquire about Peng Ying's whereabouts, and when he learned that Peng Ying had actually been directly expelled from the Castle Peak Sect, his face was gloomy to the extreme.
<br><br>"Unwillingly!"
<br><br>"It was so hard to get her into the Castle Peak Sect, and I'm still unarmed... No, I have to get her back."
