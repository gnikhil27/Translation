When Old Ancestor Qing Shan met Yi Feng's gaze, his body hurriedly bowed, not daring to say half a word.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>This person's tone sounded uncomfortable, which caused Yi Feng to frown and ask directly.
<br><br>"Who am I?"
<br><br>Rudasheng smiled coldly, then revealed the white herbal symbol on his chest, and said with a face full of arrogance: "Seeing this you understand, I might as well tell you my name again, Rudasheng!"
<br><br>After saying that, Lu Dasheng lifted his proud head and looked at Yi Feng in a condescending manner.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned slightly.
<br><br>Looking at the white flower in front of Lu Dasheng's chest that is as good as a dead person, deflated his mouth.
<br><br>Lu Dasheng?
<br><br>Have not heard of.
<br><br>Also a high-minded look, Yi Feng also did not care if he came with the old ancestor of Castle Peak, directly do not give face waved his hand and said: "Castle Peak buddy come in and sit, as for you, I do not know you, you go!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, directly Lu Dasheng to explode.
<br><br>The symbol on his chest was his pill refiner's symbol, and he, Lu Dasheng, had a reputation as the number one pill refiner in Nansha, and this man actually didn't know him?
<br><br>"Good boy."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng's face was cold as he said soberly, "I don't have time to dwell on this with you, let me ask you, is the Flame Pearl on your body?"
<br><br>"What Flame Pearl, I don't know."
<br><br>Yi Feng said rather impatiently.
<br><br>"How dare you pretend with me, in that case, then don't blame me for being merciless." With a cold expression, Lu Dasheng lifted his feet and approached towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What do you want?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a slight frown.
<br><br>"Hmph, what do I want? If you don't take out the flame pearl, then I will break your legs and tear down this broken martial school of yours!"
<br><br>After saying that, Lu Dasheng's qi became angry and he swept towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>At the same time, his palm flipped and turned into a sharp claw mark, grabbing Yi Feng's neck.
<br><br>See this attack is about to fall on Yi Feng's neck ......
<br><br>In one corner of his eye, he seemed to see something familiar.
<br><br>Is that black robe ......?
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>He suddenly reacted, this black robe is not his own?
<br><br>Then this black robe was here, under the feet of that Yi Feng?
<br><br>He fiercely locked his gaze toward Yi Feng's feet, and sure enough, this familiar figure, turned into dust he knew ah!
<br><br>"My God!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng stared at the eyes dumbfounded murmured a sentence, almost instantly, the dense fear rushed straight to the top of the head, immediately scared soul.
<br><br>At the same time legs fiercely soft, the forward momentum of his on the ground rubbed out two long a print, just stopped to the side of Yi Feng's feet.
<br><br>"I I I I ......"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng at this moment upper teeth knocking lower teeth, cold sweat on the forehead, shivering, looking at Yi Feng stammered and said: "before, before senior, you misunderstand, misunderstood, just now I made a joke with you, I I I, I came to give you something."
<br><br>Saying that, he took off the storage ring in his hand with trembling palms and respectfully placed it on Yi Feng's feet.
<br><br>"Smile!"
<br><br>After putting it.
<br><br>Turned around and ran.
<br><br>Panicked, his paws tripped on the stone floor and hit a roll, but this did not reduce his speed, climb up and continue to run.
<br><br>Running and running, the cat urine in his eyes also indisputably left down.
<br><br>"Holy shit."
<br><br>"What the fuck am I suffering from, this broken Pingjiang City, I'll fucking kill myself not to come!"
<br><br>While running, his heart that regret ah, regret that he did not listen to the words of the old ancestor of Castle Peak, ate the courage of the leopard to run here.
<br><br>The martial arts school of this one is not what big brother ah, is simply a giant brother!
<br><br>Otherwise, how could that ridiculously strong black-robed man be trampled underfoot and destroyed?
<br><br>But now, he couldn't care less about that, he just wanted to run, run out of the martial arts school's range, run out of Pingjiang City, and even run out of Nansha ......
<br><br>"You come back!"
<br><br>However, he had just not run a few steps when Yi Feng's voice came from behind him.
<br><br>These words, like a magic sound, directly made Lu Dasheng stunned in place, like an ice sculpture.
<br><br>PS: There are a few big people at home, no way, other updates may be a little late, sorry.
