"You guys ......"
<br><br>"No, don't."
<br><br>"We were wrong, please, we shouldn't have spoken like that just now, please give us another chance."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng and the others really leave, the Yin Yang double old man crawled on the ground and emitted a supplicating voice.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>No one cared about their death anymore.
<br><br>As the saying goes, you can't live with your own sins, that's exactly what happened.
<br><br>In the black hall.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>The miserable shrieks of the vain shadow continued to be heard.
<br><br>"Damn, damn it, my divine soul has turned completely transparent, I'm afraid I won't even last a year if this continues." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At the thought of this, the void shadow is worse than death.
<br><br>The first time I saw this, I was able to get to the bottom of it.
<br><br>I hate it!
<br><br>But remembering the terror of that one, he was too angry to speak.
<br><br>"No, I can't sit around and wait for death anymore, I must find someone to take over the body immediately."
<br><br>"Don't even want any damn test, as long as it's a person!"
<br><br>He gritted his teeth and made this reluctant decision, and the requirements for the person to take the body were lowered and lowered.
<br><br>By now there are no more requirements.
<br><br>After making up his mind, his body dragged into a residual shadow and swept away quickly in the direction where Yi Feng and others left.
<br><br>Not long after that.
<br><br>He finally reached the location where the Yin and Yang twin elders were.
<br><br>Looking at the dying appearance of the Yin Yang Twin Elder, his entire face turned black.
<br><br>"Damn it."
<br><br>"The people of this Immortal River Continent are too afraid of death, the hall of an immortal relic, actually only a total of so many people came in, two followed that master not to mention, the remaining two are actually such crooked people."
<br><br>But now he also has no choice, the shadow revealed, standing high above the heads of two people, ready to seize the body.
<br><br>And just in time, the weak two woke up.
<br><br>"Immortal?"
<br><br>"It's Immortal Li Yang?"
<br><br>When they saw the shadow standing in mid-air, the two were so excited that they knelt on the ground and kowtowed respectfully, thinking that they were going to be saved.
<br><br>But what they did not expect was that Immortal Li Yang, whom they were kneeling to, suddenly raised his palm and cast a spell towards them both.
<br><br>Plundering one of them Qi luck.
<br><br>Plundering the other one's body.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Plundering the body?"
<br><br>"Ah no, Immortal Li Yang, why do you want to take over our bodies?"
<br><br>Two people emitted terrified voices and asked with fearful faces.
<br><br>"Hmph, I went to a lot of trouble to make this immortal relic, do you really think it's here for you losers to get a chance?"
<br><br>"Old man is not a great sage."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The hearts of the Yin and Yang twin old men sank.
<br><br>It immediately dawned on him that this so-called Immortal's Ruins was not a place of opportunity at all, but was simply used by Li Yang to select a body snatcher.
<br><br>"Could it be that the two of us are the ones you picked out to take the body?"
<br><br>The two people were full of bitterness and said reluctantly.
<br><br>"You guys are also worthy?"
<br><br>Li Yang choked and couldn't help but scold.
<br><br>It was like a fucking pot of water.
<br><br>He really didn't know how these two crooked people had the face to say that.
<br><br>If he did not really have no choice, these two goods he did not even want to look at.
<br><br>"Seniors seniors, seniors immortals, listen to us, the people who came in this time have people who are stronger than us in terms of strength, talent and qi." One of them had a slight flash in his eyes and said in a hurry, "It's really more than worth it for you to take over us!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, and there are three of them, especially the white-robed youth at the head, he is the most suitable object to take over."
<br><br>The other one, with a malicious glint in his eyes, also hurriedly picked up the cant.
<br><br>The two of them had a tacit understanding.
<br><br>Obviously they knew that they would probably not survive, so they wanted to drag Yi Feng and the others down with them to die with them.
<br><br>Especially that mortal Yi Feng.
<br><br>Most hateful.
<br><br>It would be better to go to the eighteenth level of hell.
<br><br>However, Li Yang's face turned black.
<br><br>The illusory palm abruptly solidified, and two big ear slaps directly on the faces of the two people.
<br><br>"Senior, why are you hitting us?"
<br><br>"Why did you say you were hitting you guys?" Li Yang said in an icy voice: "Laozi's territory, what kind of people are there inside that I don't know?"
<br><br>"Then why?"
<br><br>The two people's faces were dull.
<br><br>"Okay, anyway, you will soon be taken over by me, so I am not afraid to tell you, the white-robed youth you said Laozi cannot afford to mess with, he is ten thousand times stronger than Laozi was in his life!"
<br><br>However, the two Yin Yang double old men were completely confused.
<br><br>White-robed youth ......
<br><br>Is not that Yi Feng?
<br><br>Li Yang can not afford to mess with, but also 10,000 times stronger than he was alive?
<br><br>Does this not mean?
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>The two men felt breathless.
<br><br>Wouldn't that mean that the mortal they despised was not a mortal at all, but an immortal?
<br><br>And still an immortal that was 10,000 times stronger than Li Yang was before he was born!
<br><br>"Hmph, otherwise, the old man has plenty of choices, how would he not choose you two crooked people." Li Yang said sullenly with a black face, "All right, the nonsense is also finished, you guys go to hell!"
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>Li Yang urged all the power of his divine soul and sent a final seizure to the two people.
<br><br>Finally, amidst the remorseful and unwilling expressions of the two, their bodies and the qi in their bodies were slowly taken away by Li Yang ......
<br><br>"Oops, rash!"
<br><br>"I thought I would be able to get out of the cave in a day, but looking at this look now, I guess it will take another two or three days."
<br><br>In the passage, Yi Feng, who was walking in front, let out a sigh.
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on his buttocks on the ground.
<br><br>"It's better to hold on, there is no telling how long it will take." Yun Yaoyao said softly.
<br><br>"Yes, go quickly, go quickly, early out of the heart solid." Lone Wunian also said.
<br><br>"Alas, why do people have to be so tired, combining work and rest?"
<br><br>Yi Feng stretched a lazy back, said leisurely.
<br><br>Two people immediately black face.
<br><br>Before who is like a thief, day and night to rush them to catch up, you have actually said this kind of words?
<br><br>But spit, Yun Yaoyao still walked to Yi Feng, jade hand holding Yi Feng's arm, attempting to help Yi Feng up.
<br><br>"Hold on, go out and rest again, we have no more food." Yun Yaoyao softly comforted.
<br><br>"Yes, it's better to hurry up and catch up."
<br><br>Lone Wunian also came over and took Yi Feng's other palm, while saying, "I should have known that I should have saved yesterday's beef jerky to eat, so it seems that by the time we walk to the cave entrance, we will be hungry again almost."
<br><br>"Actually, right ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head, said embarrassed: "Food words, I still have a little here."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Yi Feng touched in his arms, and touched out three more pieces of beef jerky, and a packet of peanuts, and even a bottle of wine ......
<br><br>"Crap you ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Lone Wunian broke into a cuss, pointing at Yi Feng tremblingly, "You you you, how much more do you have saved?"
