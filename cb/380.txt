Wow.
<br><br>At this moment, it was early morning.
<br><br>It was raining in this part of Pingjiang City, and the lake water was rippling under the blow of raindrops.
<br><br>The surface of the lake.
<br><br>Also floated a thin layer of light fog, hazy, quite a sense of tranquility outside the world.
<br><br>"Oops, my recliner, my recliner!"
<br><br>"And my book, my fine book!"
<br><br>Yi Feng covered his head with his hand and ran out cursing in the light rain, looking at the various items drenched by the rain, he suddenly blackened his face.
<br><br>Since the last time he moved the martial arts school's things over, they had been placed here in the open air like this, but he didn't expect it to rain.
<br><br>In fact, he can put these things inside the ring of space, but the money is not exposed.
<br><br>In addition, some time ago he heard someone say that a person picked up a storage bag in another small city a hundred miles away from Pingjiang City, and then was killed by immortal cultivators. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This matter, so he could not sleep for many days, afraid that he has a spatial ring thing spread.
<br><br>But now there is no way out ah.
<br><br>These things are his entire family, can't just put in the rain and let it rain!
<br><br>"Hurry up, take the tarpaulin to cover up the bricks, and cement sand." Yi Feng shouted at the many workers.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The people answered to a cry, have braved the rain in accordance with Yi Feng's instructions.
<br><br>After all these people left, Yi Feng then turned the ring of space in his hand, his personal belongings, what recliner ah, umbrella ah, books ah, cabinet ah and many other things, a brain thrown into the ring of space.
<br><br>After doing everything, Yi Feng came to the flat ground of the island with an umbrella, while gathering many people together.
<br><br>"What is the order, sir?"
<br><br>Large dozens of people looked at Yi Feng, respectfully, waiting for his instructions.
<br><br>"En, this time everyone's performance is good, I'm quite satisfied."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head and said.
<br><br>"Sir, you're welcome, it's right to serve you."
<br><br>The people have respectfully voiced out.
<br><br>"Everyone does not have to be so polite, the purpose of gathering you all together is just to say, look at the weather today should not be able to work, in view of your good performance, so I intend to take everyone out for a good meal." Yi Feng said loudly.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>The crowd bowed in gratitude.
<br><br>At the same time, there was a strong look of excitement on their faces, especially those workers who had just arrived, crowded around Shake Tian Que and Guan Yun Peng, and chattering sounds came out.
<br><br>"The two pipe workers, is sir going to give the chance here?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, sir is very satisfied with our performance."
<br><br>"It should be time to give the chance!"
<br><br>The urgent voices were endless ......
<br><br>Looking at this group of Martial Emperors surrounding them like children asking for candy, it rather made Guan Yunpeng and Shake Heavenly Que proud and complacent.
<br><br>Once Martial Emperors were high and mighty beings in their eyes, but now they all have to look at them one by one, and even these Martial Emperors have given a lot of gifts in private in order to flatter the two of them.
<br><br>Of course, today's two people jumped many levels in a row after getting high on the sugar beans given by Yi Feng, and also directly to Martial Emperor.
<br><br>"You people, ah, you are really indolent."
<br><br>"Look at you guys making a ruckus like what?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng straightened his robe and lectured in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Steward Guan, aren't we in a hurry?"
<br><br>A Nine-Life Martial Emperor came up and held an umbrella for Guan Yunpeng.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, in the face of Mr. Chance, how do you think we can be calm!"
<br><br>Another Eight Destiny Martial Emperor came forward, hammered his shoulders for Guan Yunpeng, and took over the conversation.
<br><br>And others, too, have looked over.
<br><br>"You guys are talking too much, when it's your turn, it will naturally be your turn." Guan Yunpeng drank in a deep voice.
<br><br>"That's right."
<br><br>"Talk less and do more."
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que also came over and shouted.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>All the Martial Emperors lowered their heads and did not dare to speak.
<br><br>"Let's go, go to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce's Baofeng Restaurant, Old Zhou, you lead the way and take them there." Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>"Follow me."
<br><br>Old Zhou yelled, led the crowd onto the bamboo raft, and a group of people marched towards Pingjiang City in great numbers.
<br><br>And Yi Feng, who was walking at the end, took Bones Ben Wei to the back of the mountain.
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng did not forget that the beasts that were caught with great difficulty.
<br><br>After coming to the back of the mountain, a dozen beasts chained with iron chains pulled to the bottom of a cliff, re-bolted.
<br><br>After all, it is possible to shelter from the wind and rain here.
<br><br>Furthermore, Yi Feng came here, is not at all to give them a change of place ......
<br><br>With a selective gaze, sweeping over the bodies of these beasts one by one.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Whoa!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Once again seeing Yi Feng, once again seeing this culprit leader, among that group of demons in the immortal world, a few demons immediately revealed a fierce and vicious appearance, opened their sharp teeth and hissed out towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>That look, hate to thirsty Yi Feng's flesh and blood.
<br><br>"Just these three."
<br><br>"The fierce nature is difficult to change, it will be difficult to obey, and look at their appearance, usually must not be a lot of harm."
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed, then waved his hand towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei nodded, caught three demon beasts with a dog, dragged and followed Yi Feng, towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Light rain drifting.
<br><br>A wave came from the void at the edge of the lake.
<br><br>Then, a divine soul landed and came.
<br><br>"This time, I am bound to explore this small island of yours to the fullest."
<br><br>"What people are there, what strength they are, what treasures they have, all of them will be under my control."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun looked at the island in the distance and emitted a confident voice.
<br><br>Then the divine soul moved, stepping on the lake water towards the island.
<br><br>But when he boarded the island and took a look, he was dumbfounded.
<br><br>Where was everyone?
<br><br>Where was everyone?
