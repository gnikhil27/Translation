Dead spirits cannot see the light, is the rule of heaven, the law of physics.
<br><br>And now, with a mere lift of the hand, all this is considered as nothing.
<br><br>The Spirit King shivered.
<br><br>He didn't dare to think deeper and hurriedly caught up with a few of Bone Benevolent who were already preparing to leave.
<br><br>"Big brother wait for me!"
<br><br>In the southeast of the Desolate Land, it was a small independent world.
<br><br>In a flash of silhouettes, twelve people arrived at the entrance of this small world.
<br><br>The small world was covered with boundaries.
<br><br>There were various crises and dense formations.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei, however, looked fascinated and lifted his head to take a deep breath. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Here, it really is filled with the smell of gold!"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>The white finger palm bone gently point.

<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It made the seven women stare at the beautiful eyes.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This is the treasury of the Cloud Top Empire, all the savings since the founding of the country?"
<br><br>The seven women were filled with disbelief.
<br><br>As the disciples of the king of Cloud Top, they had heard that this place existed, but they had never been here.
<br><br>At this moment, when they saw it, they were instantly stunned by the scene in front of them.
<br><br>There are so many treasures here.
<br><br>The Genting Empire is really profound!
<br><br>And at this moment, Skeleton Ben Wei's empty eye sockets also instantly turned into gold coins.
<br><br>"Brother, we're rich!"
<br><br>On the side, after the stagnation, the dog also rejoiced out loud.
<br><br>But finished, but found that no one answered.
<br><br>He turned his head and looked at the dumbfounded Skeleton Ben Wei slowly opened his arms and dug his head into the gold coins.
<br><br>"Big brother!"
<br><br>Several people shouted and watched as Bone Ben Wei was instantly submerged by the gold coins.
<br><br>Several people also jumped.
<br><br>"Get rich! Hahahaha, we're rich!"
<br><br>"Afterwards, the girl paper will be as much as you want."
<br><br>"I'm going to, after I go back, I'm going to call 10,000 of them, get high together and dance together ......"
<br><br>The four laughed loudly, holding the gold coins to the sky.
<br><br>The next moment, skeleton Ben Wei from the gold coins straight up in the air slowly.
<br><br>"Load, give this scum load! All loaded away!!!" Saying that, Bones Ben Wei opened his mouth and broke off the teeth in his mouth.
<br><br>Leaky mouth loudly: "back to the gas to labor a few do a thousand different models wash drop gold teeth!"
<br><br>The dog's eyes tittered a turn, "brother, do the gold teeth will not be too conspicuous? The master must see you pull out?"
<br><br>"Reasonable and reasonable!"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei said, hurriedly broke off the teeth to install back.
<br><br>The Spirit King is looking at the side, what is the big brother?
<br><br>These broken gold coins can even look at?
<br><br>The focus is not next to those immortal weapons?
<br><br>Spirit King eyes turned, gaze fell to the sky in a column of light wrapped in a white jade bottle.
<br><br>The bottle is translucent, with floating patterns on it, mysterious and extraordinary.
<br><br>The seven women also looked at the bottle, their eyes shocked and excited.
<br><br>Murphy ......
<br><br>Could it be that this is this is this is the legendary ......
<br><br>In the next moment, the madly loaded gold coins Bones Ben Wei suddenly rushed in and kicked the light mass into pieces.
<br><br>"This broken bottle is really nasty in the way!"
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>The Spirit King dropped his jaw in shock.
<br><br>The seven women almost dropped their eyes.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Little Spirit, hurry up and help me fill the gold coins!" Bones Benevolent shouted.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!" Spirit King can't care about the shock, hurriedly pick up the jaws loaded farted over and took out his storage bag and began to load.
<br><br>"Get rich get rich, girl ah, woman ah, in the future is not a dream!" Skeleton Ben Wei while loading while laughing loudly.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, get rich, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ......"
<br><br>Spirit King afterglow looked next to the broken bottles all over the ground, the heart is dripping blood.
<br><br>"Brother to tell you, gold coins are good stuff." The skeleton Ben Wei did not raise his head to teach, "Remember brother's words, nothing is better than money!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes."
<br><br>The Spirit King nodded his head like a garlic, and his gaze inadvertently glanced at a branch next to a white immortal Qi bubbling.
<br><br>The eyes instantly lit up.
<br><br>That that that that ......
<br><br>It was used by some Tongtian immortal several eras ago ......
<br><br>"Ka!" The dog broke off the branch and threw it aside, "This what a crap thing really takes up space."
<br><br>Saying that, he tied dozens of storage bags to his body, making a clanking sound, while shouting, "Brother, I have dozens of storage bags full, do you have more?"
<br><br>Spirit King: ......
<br><br>He beat his chest!
<br><br>"This rag is also in the way."
<br><br>Wow!
<br><br>A piece of black talisman cloth in the sky shining with black light was also torn to pieces by the centipede!
<br><br>He couldn't help himself!
<br><br>"Big brother, I think you might not know about these things ......"
<br><br>But no one paid attention to the Spirit King's words.
<br><br>"Brother, there's not a single gold coin over here, it's all broken copper and iron, and it's doing its damnedest to block the way!" The dog shouted.
<br><br>"What?
<br><br>"Then how much more?"
<br><br>"Milk agent, come here, destroy all these broken things, don't let those garbage block your dog brother's way." Skeleton Benway said without lifting his head, "Go look over there again."
<br><br>The Spirit King and the seven women rushed over like the wind, and their hearts were dripping blood as they watched all kinds of extremely valuable treasures being crushed one by one by the milking agent.
<br><br>Wasteful.
<br><br>It is simply a waste!
<br><br>"Brother, let's help you destroy things!" The seven women could not stand it anymore, all pulled out their storage bags and rushed to say.
<br><br>"Stop it!"
<br><br>Just heard a rebuke, the seven women's bodies were bound by an invisible force!
<br><br>The next moment, was pulled back to sit on the stool next to.
<br><br>"The seven little beauties sit properly." Skeleton Benevolent scolded. "How can I let you guys do all that tiring work?"
<br><br>"Not tired, not tired!"
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"Okay, then tired."
<br><br>When the seven people saw this, they could only respond helplessly.
<br><br>Then they could only continue to watch the sky as a ball of light, destroyed in the hands of this group of four.
<br><br>Seven people almost myocardial infarction, heartache teeth are clenched!
<br><br>But the good thing is, the brothers collected gold coins collected forgetfulness, and then was directly ignored their existence.
<br><br>This let the seven women immediately found the opportunity to pick up a little scraps of food.
<br><br>"Master sorry, sorry."
<br><br>"I will repay you in the next life."
<br><br>The seven women spoke with guilt in their hearts.
<br><br>But as they spoke, their own storage rings were almost full.
