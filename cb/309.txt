After the woman in white left, Yi Feng continued on his journey.
<br><br>But what just happened, still gave Yi Feng a wake up call.
<br><br>In this kind of big mountain rush, it is indeed very dangerous ah, because no one can predict what will be encountered behind some things.
<br><br>But still did not let Yi Feng give up taking this road.
<br><br>In his opinion, the poor and vicious humans are much more dangerous than the beasts.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>More preparation is still very necessary.
<br><br>So in the process of rushing, Yi Feng through the system to give him the knowledge of medicine, will pay special attention to some herbs.
<br><br>"This one is Mo Yu grass, it carries a strong poison."
<br><br>"And this White Withered Leaf, rumor has it that one drop of juice can paralyze ten elephants!"
<br><br>Yi Feng squatted on the ground and carefully collected the herbs. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>He also found a bowl from the Ring of Space, ground all these herbs into juice, and poured them drop by drop into the small bottle.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Only half a bottle."
<br><br>"To be on the safe side, it's better to get a full bottle!"
<br><br>The next two or three days, Yi Feng rushed while working on this goal.
<br><br>Of course, other preparations he did not do less, using a knife to sharpen the bamboo out of a lot of silver needle-sized arrows.
<br><br>And got a reed pole pole of about the same size.
<br><br>"Poof!"
<br><br>Poison arrow blow X.
<br><br>It flew out and a small leopard that attacked him instantly fell to the ground.
<br><br>"Awesome."
<br><br>Yi Feng was satisfied with his own masterpiece.
<br><br>Time passed, it was half a month, Yi Feng had completely penetrated into the 100,000 Great Mountains, fortunately, the whole journey had no danger.
<br><br>Boom.
<br><br>At this time, the distant sky suddenly came a burst of sound, flashing out countless fire lights, a flash.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>"Is it thunder?"
<br><br>Looking at this flickering light, Yi Feng thought this way.
<br><br>But Yi Feng did not care.
<br><br>After all, this commotion looked far, far away from him.
<br><br>But just as he was about to continue his journey, he suddenly noticed something smashing towards him in the distant sky.
<br><br>The speed was so fast that it was like a meteorite smashing over.
<br><br>"This ...... seems to be a human figure?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes widened, but just as he was horrified, he found out even more terribly that the figure was smashing over towards him.
<br><br>"KAM!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed and drew his legs to run.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>He just ran a few steps, the figure landed with a bang, and many trees nearby were smashed and cut off under the huge impact.
<br><br>And Yi Feng was also shaken down to the ground by the force.
<br><br>"Blah blah blah ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng rose from the ground, mouth spit out a mouthful of mud, immediately found a large pit in front of the inside, smashed down a human figure.
<br><br>Approach to take a look.
<br><br>Yi Feng was instantly shocked.
<br><br>This person, is not the female cultivator who flew over from the sky that day and helped him cut down that lion?
<br><br>What is it that actually beat such a powerful cultivator like this?
<br><br>Inside this mountain, there can't really be something terrifying, right?
<br><br>Yi Feng felt a pang of fear.
<br><br>But also know that saving people is important, the white woman turned up from the ground, which revealed her delicate face.
<br><br>But at the moment, her breath is very weak, under the powerful attack has long become ragged, a piece of white skin exposed.
<br><br>Especially the pair of long legs, but also let Yi Feng eyes straight glare.
<br><br>"Don't be rude don't be rude, save lives."
<br><br>Yi Feng hands together, shake off the distracting thoughts in his mind, then seriously help the woman to check the injury.
<br><br>After all, this kind of seriously injured people to save up Yi Feng or slightly understand some, to move her before, must confirm the injury, otherwise it is easy to cause secondary injury.
<br><br>So, Yi Feng first started with the woman's arm.
<br><br>He gently pinched.
<br><br>Luckily, the bones were all okay.
<br><br>Then Yi Feng lifted those long legs of hers, from the footplate to the thigh, and checked them in the same way.
<br><br>"It's okay too."
<br><br>Yi Feng again looked at the woman's chest, where there were obviously signs of having suffered an impact.
<br><br>Then he examined her ribs with the palm of his hand.
<br><br>"Something doesn't seem right here."
<br><br>Yi Feng murmured seriously, but was not sure, so he had to double-check.
<br><br>After all, this thing is not a joke, broken ribs a get it wrong, but will pierce the body's organs.
<br><br>For a time, Yi Feng repeatedly touched.
<br><br>But at this time, the woman in white closed beautiful eyes opened suddenly, a killing intent on the body suddenly diffused out.
<br><br>Towards Yi Feng covered.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"You're actually awake?"
<br><br>When Yi Feng saw her open eyes, he exclaimed, secretly saying that this woman's vitality was really strong, and then solemnly reminded, "Don't move, I'll help you check your injuries."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng closed his eyes and his palm was still touching the woman's ribs.
<br><br>"I'll kill you."
<br><br>The white-clothed woman suddenly cold light straight up, the mouth out of the icy cold voice.
<br><br>Also never thought that this human actually took advantage of her when she was not prepared to take advantage of her, and even more annoyingly, this person was actually touching ...... in a dignified manner after she woke up
<br><br>But she was just about to attack, her chest was a bore, a mouthful of blood spat out.
<br><br>"How are you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked in a hurry, about to hold the woman in white.
<br><br>"Get the hell out of my way."
<br><br>But the woman in white shook off Yi Feng's arm and bellowed coldly.
<br><br>"Huh, what's wrong with you people, I said I was helping you check your injuries."
<br><br>Was so a drink, Yi Feng heart suddenly unhappy, although it is indeed easy to cause misunderstanding, but the disease is not a taboo doctor this is common sense, which is more important do not have a little forced number?
<br><br>"No need for you to care."
<br><br>The woman in white still had a cold face and drank.
<br><br>"Really do not need?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a frown.
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>The woman in white drank icily, with a strong disgust in her eyes.
<br><br>"Got it."
<br><br>Good intentions are not rewarded, Yi Feng is not bothered, so he directly packed up his things and left ......
<br><br>For Yi Feng's departure, the woman in white did not even look at a glance.
<br><br>Tightly clenched shellfish teeth, strong injury to make themselves stand up, but just hold up a little, then weakly sat back down, check their own body injuries, unprecedentedly heavy.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>Just then, a roar suddenly came, approaching her with a heavy snort.
<br><br>He glanced sideways, and his pretty face sank.
<br><br>It was a very low-level demonic beast, if it was in the past, she wouldn't even look at it, but at this moment, she was no different from fish meat on a sticky board.
<br><br>"Damn."
<br><br>Her face was pale.
<br><br>The look was full of resignation.
<br><br>With her status, it was hard for her to accept that she would become the rations of a low-level demonic beast.
<br><br>"Swoosh!"
<br><br>However, just as she was about to give up, a bamboo arrow came and the low-level demonic beast fell to the ground in response to the sound.
<br><br>At the same time, a white-robed figure came back cursing.
<br><br>"You say you bitch, what are you trying to be strong for, I save you and you don't let me, turn into a piece of shit and you're happy?"
