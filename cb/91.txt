"Very good!"
<br><br>The three martial spirits nodded in satisfaction.
<br><br>"Just three lords, since they have come now ......" Mao Lin turned his expectant gaze to the three and asked carefully, "Then please, three lords, let's strike to finish them off immediately, right? "
<br><br>"There is no hurry, some waste but, drink this pot of wine, then go to solve them is not urgent." That Martial Spirit expert gently hefted the wine jug and personally poured a cup of wine for Mao Lin.
<br><br>"Good, then I will accompany the three lords after drinking this pot of wine, haha."
<br><br>Seeing the three people so relaxed and breezy, Mao Lin also simply relaxed.
<br><br>Even more, in order to make the three great martial spirits even more satisfied, he also called for a dozen of maids to help.
<br><br>For a time.
<br><br>Inside the hall, there was constant laughter and singing and dancing.
<br><br>"My lord, this wine is the strongest wine I have found at your command." Mao Lin said with a smile.
<br><br>"Well, it's very good, this wine is very strong to drink." One of the martial spirit experts stood up and patted Mao Lin's shoulder, while the tricky palm didn't forget to rub two on the maid's body. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Soon, the drinks on the table were swept away.
<br><br>The three Martial Spirit experts slowly stood up with a hint of drunkenness, before saying to Mao Lin father and son two: "Go, first go out to help you to solve that what Yi Feng shouted, we will come back to continue drinking."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Mao Lin father and son can't stop smiling.
<br><br>Now, not only solved the crisis of his Chamber of Commerce, it is likely to solve the problem from the source, directly to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce to kill ah.
<br><br>The most crucial thing is that, with the three great martial spirit experts in the backing, there is no need to fear that the Castle Peak Sect will find any trouble.
<br><br>The three great Martial Spirit experts were in the front, and the two Mao Lin fathers and sons were in the back, all with smiles on their faces as they walked towards the door.
<br><br>"Third brother, a group of waste but, brother we two will not do it, you alone to solve it." On the way out, one of the martial spirits said to the other martial spirit.
<br><br>"Don't worry brother, they can't call any powerful people, such a little thing will not need the two brothers to do, I can solve it alone." The martial spirit said.
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>"Haha ......"
<br><br>With the sound of three people's arrogant laughter, a group of people finally walked out of the door.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The moment they walked out of the door, the three Martial Spirit experts' paws steeply weakened.
<br><br>They almost stumbled and fell to the ground.
<br><br>The first thing that appeared in front of them were dozens of pairs of tiger eyes, and the owners of these eyes were all standing in the air, emitting a strong cold intent.
<br><br>The most damned thing that made the three great martial spirits despair was that none of the cultivation levels revealed by the owners of these dozens of pairs of eyes were actually weaker than them.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>At the same time, accompanied by a series of roars of demonic beasts, a large group of flying demonic beasts attacked, hovering in the high altitude, and on top of the demonic beasts, sat an expert dressed in armor, with a strong aura, just waiting for a command, they could strike in an instant.
<br><br>"Kill kill kill!"
<br><br>And in the invisible place, at the same time came a burst of deafening sound, is the green mountain door countless disciples of the cry, although can not see the silhouette, but just listening to the sound will give people heavy pressure, as if the next moment will step on the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Of course, the most scary for the three is that high in the sky, holding a kitchen knife of the old man.
<br><br>The kitchen knife, emitting a long light.
<br><br>And he, hair fluttering, standing in the air, just standing there, is worth a thousand armies and horses.
<br><br>Looking at this formation, the three martial spirit experts shivered, the body of drunkenness also snapped awake, a drop of cold sweat from the top of the head slipped down.
<br><br>And Mao Lin father and son two looked at this kind of lineup, also scared a big jump, although they are not bad in the mortal status, but also never seen this kind of lineup.
<br><br>"President, what about this?"
<br><br>"Yes, President."
<br><br>"Are they so many people, it looks so scary, think of a way?"
<br><br>And at this time, other people from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce also rushed over and clustered around Mao Lin's side, and worried voices came out.
<br><br>Mao Lin also frowned.
<br><br>However, once he remembered that the three great Martial Spirit experts were sitting right next to them, he regained his strength.
<br><br>So he raised his chest and gently drank towards the people of Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce: "Why are you panicking? Just calm down, although there are many of them, but we have three Martial Spirit experts in town, in the eyes of the three of them, they are just silver spears and wax heads."
<br><br>He said, with a smile on his face, he looked at the three Martial Spirits and said with a smile on his face, "Three lords, you think I'm right, I think you should be able to easily solve them with your hands, right?"
