It seems that Mr. means has really reached the realm of the celestial, for everything is like a finger in the eye ah!
<br><br>But at the same time, he also panicked in his heart, sir will not dislike me because of this, right?
<br><br>"Don't worry, it won't."
<br><br>Yi Feng saw through Lu Qingshan's mind with a glance and said comfortingly, "Once upon a time, I was also like you."
<br><br>After saying.
<br><br>Yi Feng let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>In his previous life, he had just graduated is not like this, work and entrepreneurship everywhere, encounter acquaintances have to pretend to be a good mix of the appearance.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>However, Yi Feng's words scared Lu Qingshan a big jump.
<br><br>The original Mr. once also mouth this bite, and can also be so frankly said, Mr. is really worthy of Mr..
<br><br>He secretly took this hobby of Mr. to heart. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>He has been thinking of repaying the kindness it, the other I'm afraid Mr. no can look at, but this piece he has a lot of resources.
<br><br>"Come with me, go to my island to manage things."
<br><br>Then, Yi Feng said again.
<br><br>"Thank you, sir."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's eyes lit up, in fact, he had long wanted to follow Yi Feng to the island, but was just too embarrassed to ask.
<br><br>After all, his strength was much worse than the group of people on the island.
<br><br>But he didn't expect that Mr. had directly invited him.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Because of the same hobby, himself and Mr. a lot closer ah!
<br><br>After taking Lu Qingshan back to the island, Yi Feng returned to the newly built new house.
<br><br>Then he took out a map.
<br><br>It was a map of the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>"Middle Continent, North Sea ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng knocked on the map and locked his eyes on these two areas.
<br><br>Because he had thought about it, only by going to a bigger place with more sects would he have a better chance of running into the kind of blind sects that would take him into their pocket.
<br><br>It's just that the map over here was made so rudimentary that it didn't even have a scale.
<br><br>So Yi Feng didn't even know how far these two places were from him.
<br><br>"But tens of thousands of miles I'm afraid!"
<br><br>Yi Feng murmured softly.
<br><br>But even this far away, it still didn't discourage him.
<br><br>At least, today he also has a mount, running a speed of 40 or 50 yards, a day to run three or four hundred kilometers, a month can also be reached.
<br><br>After all, this is a big deal that involves his cultivation.
<br><br>After finalizing the attention, Yi Feng was ready to leave in a few days.
<br><br>Just then, outside, Lu Qingshan rushed in.
<br><br>"Qiao mister, Miss Mor Sihan, the flower leader, requests to see you sir, what do you think?" Lu Qingshan said.
<br><br>"Mor Sihan?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up, he was about to ask this woman about that nocturne, but he didn't expect her to come over first by herself.
<br><br>So he hurriedly got up and said, "Quick, invite her to the island."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan retreated and was just about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and turned back towards Yi Feng and said, "By the way sir, today Miss Strange Sihan is dressed strangely."
<br><br>"Strangely dressed?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, did not understand Lu Qingshan's meaning, and quickly asked: "How strange is it?"
<br><br>"Just, just."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan touched his leg, a description also could not describe a reason, finally had to say: "Anyway, I have never seen this dressing, but I personally feel quite good-looking."
<br><br>"Come on, come on, you do not describe it, you hurry to invite people to me to see it." Yi Feng waved his hand and said impatiently.
<br><br>"Yes, sir."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan hurriedly retreated.
<br><br>Soon after, the waiting Yi Feng heard a voice from outside.
<br><br>"Giggle giggle ......"
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>This voice made Yi Feng's eyelids jump.
<br><br>This voice.
<br><br>How come it was so familiar?
