Although the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan is much stronger than most demon beasts, and their talent is much better, but those who want to cultivate to the Demon King or above realm are still very few, and are only much easier than other races of demon beasts.
<br><br>So most of the demon wolves, but also the bottom realm.
<br><br>At this moment, the Devouring Heaven Plain, with the river as the boundary.
<br><br>The Red Sun lineage and the Royal lineage have each gathered 100,000 troops to look at each other across the river, with swords drawn.
<br><br>Although the red sun lineage lost a large number of experts the other day, but against the royal family lineage is still not weak, even after Ao Bi Fang started a rebellion, but also the royal family lineage defeated.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Such as this battle, look at the high-end battle power.
<br><br>Forced by the pressure of that martial arts school and Ao Qing, Ao Bi Fang can no longer wait, today is to want to completely take down the royal family lineage in one fell swoop.
<br><br>"Heaven Devouring Emperor, if you take the initiative to bring your royal family lineage to surrender, you may still be able to save a life today!"
<br><br>On the other side of the river, Ao Bi Fang stood in the air and sent a cold voice towards the Heaven Devouring Emperor.
<br><br>"Humph!" The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Ao Bi Fang, you are not afraid of the wind, today is your death time." Devouring Heavenly Emperor stepped on the ground, tilted his head and said in a bold voice: "Come on, a direct battle, no need to beep so much."
<br><br>"I can't believe that you, Ao Zhong, have the guts to fight with me, you must have forgotten how you fled in a mess a few days ago!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's face was disdainful as he said, his surrounding demon power running in a full circle.
<br><br>To him, this was better.
<br><br>If he could kill the Heaven Devouring Emperor directly, it would also avoid a big battle for his men, and it would be considered to have cut a lot of losses for his Red Sun Lineage.
<br><br>As soon as the demonic power moved, the half-exalted pressure expanded out, and with one foot in mid-air, he was already in front of the Heaven Devouring Emperor in the next moment.
<br><br>"Go to hell!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang sneered and struck out with a killing move.
<br><br>As his palm pushed out fiercely, the entire space overlapped, and the majestic demonic power turned into layers of frightening waves in mid-air, blasting towards Ao Zhong and covering the past.
<br><br>Seeing that the waves were nearing the top of Devouring Emperor's head, Ao Bi Fang couldn't help but raise the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>This blow.
<br><br>Even if it doesn't kill the Heaven-devouring Emperor, it is enough to seriously injure him.
<br><br>This is, the realm of suppression.
<br><br>Even if he was only a half-exalted, but against a demon sect, it was really easy.
<br><br>But the next moment, his face changed.
<br><br>Only to see a vast aura erupting from the Devouring Emperor's body, which was actually not even close to him.
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>"How come you're also a Half-Emperor?"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang asked incredulously.
<br><br>"Humph, only you can break through, but not me?" The Heaven Devouring Emperor coldly laughed, and also at the same moment when his cultivation exploded out, his hands fiercely pushed out.
<br><br>In an instant, an invisible energy was propelled out by him, and boomed as it collided with Ao Bi Fang's stacked waves.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>As the two powerful forces collided, thunderous sounds rolled out from the sky, a spatial crack ripped open, and the entire space was like turning into an ocean in a storm.
<br><br>At the same time, the majestic qi spread out in all directions, the shock wave pushed hundreds of thousands of figures below backward, close to the people are tumbling.
<br><br>This blow collision, actually is not divided.
<br><br>This instantly let Ao Bi Fang's face shrugged down, originally the morale of the huge Red Sun lineage, is also a great fall in morale.
<br><br>No one had expected that the Heaven Devouring Emperor had actually broken through to the half-exalted realm.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"Half-exalted realm, really powerful."
<br><br>Heaven Devouring Emperor laughed unrestrainedly and stared at Ao Bi Fang and sneered, "Ao Bi Fang, today you cannot resist me, instead, today you will be buried here."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's face was twitching.
<br><br>Narrowed his gaze and did not speak, but slowly from the storage ring, took out a delicate small box.
<br><br>Seeing this, the experts of the Red Sun lineage were all greatly alarmed.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang this is going to be?"
<br><br>"He, he's actually going to take the Berserk Pill!"
<br><br>"Could it be that the Heaven Devouring Emperor is really that difficult to deal with?"
<br><br>Looking at the pill, they all emitted incredible sounds.
<br><br>And the Devouring Heaven Emperor's face changed similarly.
<br><br>Staring at Ao Bi Fang, he said soberly, "Ao Bi Fang, you are really ruthless, you actually took out the last Berserk Pill of your Red Sun lineage, do you know that even if you take it and defeat me, you will need to pay half of your own life span as the price!"
<br><br>"As long as it allows my Red Sun lineage to unify the tribe."
<br><br>"I, Ao Bi Fang, do not deserve to die."
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's eyes narrowed slightly, and actually without the slightest hesitation, he took the Berserk Pill in his hand.
<br><br>He no longer had a way back.
<br><br>The same half-exalted realm, if the Devouring Emperor ran, he could not kill at all, but if he delayed any longer, until Ao Qing returned, then his Red Sun lineage would have no chance of victory to speak of.
<br><br>Therefore, even at the greatest cost, we must take the victory today.
<br><br>"You are cruel!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the Heaven Devouring Emperor immediately clenched his tooth crown, revealing a deep scorn.
<br><br>And the medicinal effect of the Berserk Pill also quickly took effect.
<br><br>Almost at a visible speed, the aura on Ao Bi Fang's body was soaring, crossing over the half-divine and chasing towards the real demon dweller.
<br><br>Finally, when infinitely close to the Demon Dignity realm, Ao Bi Fang's climbing, finally came to a halt.
<br><br>"Infinitely close, it's always not to the Demon Dignity!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang raised his palm, feeling the power within his body, and said in a deep voice: "However, it is more than enough to deal with a Half Djinn!"
<br><br>The voice fell, he instantly disappeared, and even the remnants could not be seen.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor instantly broke into a cold sweat, and the next moment, a powerful sense of crisis appeared from behind him.
<br><br>His eyes were raised, and while he turned around fiercely, a fist carrying huge demonic power blasted towards his back.
<br><br>Sure enough, Ao Bi Fang appeared behind him.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The two of them, heavily collided into each other.
<br><br>But even though Heaven Devouring Emperor blocked Ao Bi Fang's blow, the difference in cultivation level was incomparable.
<br><br>Therefore, Heaven Devouring Emperor was directly blown away by this punch and smashed down from the ground, accompanied by a sound of the ground shaking, and then smashed out a big crater.
<br><br>"Is the difference between a half-victor and a demon venerable that big, not to mention that this guy is not even a demon venerable yet?"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and slowly climbed up with a look full of reluctance.
<br><br>But just as he climbed up, he saw Ao Bi Fang attacking in the sky as an arc.
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor hurriedly transferred his demonic power and formed a protective shield around his body.
<br><br>The moment the protective shield took shape, a fist bombardment came.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>The protective shield exploded, and although it helped the Heaven Devouring Emperor resist most of the power before it exploded, there was still a lot of power falling on him.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>His body, rubbing on the ground tumbled, bringing up a series of dust at the same time, leaving a thousand-foot gully, before the Heaven Devouring Emperor was able to stabilize his body.
<br><br>"It's really hard to resist!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor coughed violently, and after struggling to hold up his body, he couldn't help but raise his palm and touch the hidden compartment of his clothes.
