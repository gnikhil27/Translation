Li Hongtian nodded his head like a chicken pecking rice.
<br><br>Although I do not know why not to offend the Human Immortal Earth Immortal, but look at Lu Chong this serious look, I'm afraid it's not nothing.
<br><br>After a simple meal, Lu Chong took a look at the sky and put down his chopsticks.
<br><br>"You two take your time, I'm done eating."
<br><br>Lu Chong slowly stood up.
<br><br>"Ah this ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Hongtian asked nervously, "Is this not good for me, how come Brother Lu has finished eating so quickly?"
<br><br>"Li Zhou Lord need not be nervous, the meal feast is very good, only then there are more important things to do."
<br><br>After saying that, Lu Chong walked out of the house and came under the sunlight, taking advantage of the sunlight to take out his pair of dung buckets.
<br><br>Even now he got rid of the title of waste and even became the pride of heaven in Li Hongtian's mouth, but he did not dare to forget his roots.
<br><br>What's more, he didn't dare to forget Chief Lu's teachings. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Love the barrel as you love yourself.
<br><br>No.
<br><br>Better than loving oneself.
<br><br>Therefore, it is essential to maintain the bucket three times a day: early in the morning, at noon, and in the evening.
<br><br>Wipe.
<br><br>Stroking.
<br><br>Polishing and waxing.
<br><br>Each step can not be missed.
<br><br>Li Hongtian saw Lu Chong did not eat, sitting on the threshold in the hot sun holding a bucket immersed in it, also could not help but put down his chopsticks and followed.
<br><br>He also wanted to see what Lu Chong was doing in the end.
<br><br>Just approached, did not have time to ask questions, it is like a lightning strike like stunned in place, cold sweat.
<br><br>Because at this moment Lu Chong is carrying out to the polishing step.
<br><br>According to Chief Lu's experience, polishing when using a trace of immortal power to promote, so that you can get twice the result with half the effort.
<br><br>Just now Lu Chong injected a trace of power into the barrel.
<br><br>With the injection of a trace of power, the dung bucket, which originally looked ordinary, suddenly emitted the aura of its top immortal weapon.
<br><br>And this aura.
<br><br>It happened to be felt by Li Hongtian who came behind.
<br><br>At this moment, Li Hongtian's legs are trembling.
<br><br>That wisp of breath was simply too terrifying.
<br><br>He shivered and couldn't help but ask: "Lu, brother Lu, dare I ask, dare I ask what is this in your hand?"
<br><br>"Oh, this is my dung bucket."
<br><br>Lu Chong said carelessly as he polished it.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Li Hongtian fart y can not help but a clip, stared at the eyes and asked: "You, you really take the dung?"
<br><br>"What am I lying to you for?"
<br><br>Lu Chong couldn't help but give him a white glance.
<br><br>Li Hongtian had some heart attack.
<br><br>Although he believed that eight or nine percent of what Lu Chong said was true, but only the matter of carrying dung, that Lu Chong was joking with him.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>An expert of the late Genuine Immortal Realm, how will carry dung it is right.
<br><br>But now it seems that Lu Chong actually really carry dung.
<br><br>That's not true.
<br><br>Thinking of something, Li Hongtian's heart jerked again.
<br><br>He found that he had just focused on the wrong focus.
<br><br>Because the bigger focus, should not be, the bucket of dung, why can give off such a powerful aura?
<br><br>"Brother Lu, dare I ask, this bucket in your hand, is it a top-tier, top-tier immortal weapon?" Li Hongtian asked nervously.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Lu Chong answered, while lifting the bucket of dung to look carefully by the sunlight, also want to see if there is still shit residue inside the bucket.
<br><br>"It's really a top-tier immortal weapon, it's actually really a top-tier immortal weapon." For a while, Li Hongtian looked at Lu Chong's pair of dung buckets with glowing eyes, his heart could not be calmed, and could not help but ask: "So you, usually carrying dung, just use the top immortal weapon?"
<br><br>"Of course!"
<br><br>Lu Chong nodded.
<br><br>The confirmation from Lu Chong Li Hongtian was completely unsettled, clutching his chest and panting heavily.
<br><br>Use the top immortal weapon to carry the dung.
<br><br>This was simply unheard of and unseen.
<br><br>"Let Li continental master laugh, it's not that we can't get something better there to carry dung, it's just because again down only just go." Lu Chong said with a smile, "My other partners are all heaven-grade immortal weapons, especially the pair of dung buckets for our chief, which were hand-made by Mr. and hand-gifted to the chief, so high that you can't see the level."
<br><br>"You do not say it ......"
<br><br>Li Hongtian touched his heart with one hand, while swinging up his palm, and said with a dark face.
<br><br>If he continued to listen to Lu Chong like this, it was estimated that he would be the first Star Immortal Realm to die of heart attack.
<br><br>It took a long, long time to slow down.
<br><br>Li Hongtian asked carefully again, "Brother Lu, take the liberty to ask one more question, if I had fought with you just now ......"
<br><br>Before Li Hongtian could finish, Lu Chong said, "Of course, if we fought, I would have used this pair of dung buckets and suppressed Li Zhou Lord directly."
<br><br>"But speaking of which, Li Chau Lord, you're really keeping me from having fun."
<br><br>"Originally, I wanted to try the power of this pair of dung buckets, but who knew that you directly raised the white flag and invited us to dinner so politely, making us too embarrassed to do it."
<br><br>"Why don't we break up and forget about it, Lord Li Zhou, so I can play well with the power of this pair of buckets of shit."
<br><br>"Don't don't don't ......"
<br><br>Li Hongtian waved up his hands, and also his scalp tingled.
<br><br>In the heart.
<br><br>Also filled with posterior fear.
<br><br>You say in case, at that time he that head did not turn around, he head iron and Lu Chong fight.
<br><br>That now his own ......
<br><br>Thinking of this, he could not help but glance at the pair of dung buckets, hit a cold shiver.
<br><br>It should be suppressed by that pair of dung buckets!
