The old ancestor of Green Mountain has returned to the room.
<br><br>Slightly intoxicated, the more he thought about it, the more wrong it was.
<br><br>Even if Ye Bei knew who was right and who was wrong, at best, he would just hand over those three martial spirits to him, and at the same time release him from the formation of the Castle Peak Sect. There is absolutely no need to make such a big show to make amends, and even take out Huazi kind of good things.
<br><br>After all, Ye Bei is at least a Martial Emperor powerhouse, there is absolutely no need to make such a show to a Martial King like him.
<br><br>Just at this time, Ye Bei people will also send back the supreme divine sword, the divine sword carefully held in his hand, which makes the old ancestor of Castle Peak even more wrong.
<br><br>The path of martial arts cultivation has always been deceitful.
<br><br>Especially in the face of treasures, no one dares to guarantee that they are a good person, and Ye Bei face to this kind of supreme treasure are able to return, this is too abnormal!
<br><br>"Could it be that he has already gone to see the senior?"
<br><br>Suddenly, the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak reacted violently.
<br><br>At that time, after Ye Bei had searched his soul, he remembered clearly the scene of rushing towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>And just now when drinking, although Ye Bei disguised very well, but the old ancestor of Castle Peak still captured Ye Bei body injuries, and very heavy. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>These things in series, it can be guessed that Ye Bei must have found Mr. there, and then was beaten half to death to run back, back to his Castle Peak door a reversal of the norm, a mouth a Castle Peak old brother, it is clear that Ye Bei is trying to borrow him Lu Qingshan to save his life.
<br><br>Once thought of here, the old ancestor of Castle Peak snapped his thighs, and the body's drunkenness sobered up violently.
<br><br>"Hasty ah!"
<br><br>He was filled with remorse.
<br><br>He, Lu Qingshan, was just a what in front of Mr. ah, if it was someone Mr. really wanted to kill, what role could he, Lu Qingshan, play in it?
<br><br>If not, he will also get into trouble because of Ye Bei and kill himself ah!
<br><br>"Damn Ye Bei, so strong-minded." The old ancestor of Castle Peak cursed bitterly, and began to think in his heart about how to return Hua Zi to Ye Bei, while leading the disciples of Castle Peak Sect to leave this place as soon as possible.
<br><br>Because he knew very well in his heart that this thief ship could not be allowed.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He had just made up his mind when the door of the room was suddenly pushed open.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak frowned and raised his head up to look, and suddenly his eyes widened!
<br><br>Only to see, that outside the door into the two fair-skinned young girls, they are not very old, petite appearance still with some baby fat.
<br><br>And it was their clothing that was the most eye-catching, one of them was wearing a small white dress with a small fox tail behind her, and the other was in a tight black dress with a pair of cat ears on her tied hair.
<br><br>"Old Ancestor, we were sent by the Lord of the Gang to serve you."
<br><br>The two women said in unison.
<br><br>While speaking, that white-clothed maiden beamed at Old Ancestor Qingshan. The other black-clothed maiden even crawled up on the ground, displaying her cat's flirtatious posture to the fullest.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Such a scene, watching the qi blood in the body of the old ancestor of the green mountain surge, spare with the realm of the martial king also almost failed to suppress, feel their nosebleeds are about to spurt out.
<br><br>"Damn Ye Bei, why do you know that I am good at this?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan stared at him with wide eyes, but he instantly understood that this was a sugar-coated cannonball from Ye Bei, once he was tricked, he was bound to step into this thieving boat and couldn't get off.
<br><br>"Steady, steady."
<br><br>"My old ancestor over the years what big wind and big waves have not seen, must be steady."
<br><br>Reluctantly glancing at the two women, the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak closed his eyes tightly, crossed his knees on the ground, his mouth was muttering the cultivation mantra.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, what's wrong with you, why are you ignoring us sisters?"
<br><br>"Yes, come and play with our sisters!"
<br><br>The two women's seductive voices came to his ears, and the two pairs of delicate jade hands slowly slid down the ears of the old man, causing goose bumps to rise on the old man's forehead and cold sweat to flow.
<br><br>"Shhh!"
<br><br>The two women blew in the old man's ear left and right, and the fingertips drew circles in the old man's chest.
<br><br>This time, almost made the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak go straight to the fire.
<br><br>"Son of a bitch Ye Bei, I said your grandma, you're too fucking mean!"
<br><br>Green Mountain Old Ancestor mouth broken curses, body straight up, the house directly smashed out of a hole, into a stream of light, head into a pool of water not far from the Explosive Sky Gang.
