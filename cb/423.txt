The four could vaguely see that the one in front of them had already walked out of the first line of the valley.
<br><br>Just need to wait for the process of dissipating the poisonous fog to pass, they can catch up and say hello.
<br><br>The four of them were so excited that they could not wait.
<br><br>Each one of them arranged their clothes at the same time, even the words of flattery in the mouth are ready.
<br><br>Especially Taiyi Valley Liu Gu Yi Patriarch, using Yuan Qi to make his appearance a few points younger not to mention, but also in the storage ring to find thirty years ago rouge applied to the face.
<br><br>Although not as young and beautiful as the latter woman, but in case this senior is good at this?
<br><br>"You, you in front of me thirty years have not applied rouge once, this time you, you actually ......" Jian Hengtian ironically looked at Liu Gu Yi, sourly said.
<br><br>"What do you care?"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi glared at Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>"Well, well, it's me who doesn't deserve it!"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian trembled his voice and angrily skipped his head. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just like this, all the people were ready, just waiting for the poisonous fog to dissipate to meet the senior person.
<br><br>Just at this time.
<br><br>The body in front of them fiercely turned its body.
<br><br>Looked at them.
<br><br>Four people's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Heart excited, this senior is to take the initiative to say hello to them?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The next words made them shiver.
<br><br>"You few, how much farther do you want to follow me?"
<br><br>A gloomy and hoarse voice came out from Yi Feng's mouth.
<br><br>"Scuff!"
<br><br>Then, a kitchen knife was drawn from his waist, flashing out a cold light.
<br><br>"Either die or get lost!"
<br><br>An icy cold voice came out from Yi Feng's mouth.
<br><br>These words sent chills down the bodies of the four people who had been expecting nothing less, and sweat spilled directly from their foreheads.
<br><br>Almost instantly.
<br><br>Four people have run out of shadow.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng put away the kitchen knife a smile.
<br><br>Behind these few sneaky people followed him all the way, always hanging at a distance of a hundred feet, how would he not know?
<br><br>And they followed their own purpose, Yi Feng saw through at a glance.
<br><br>Must be the mountain bandits who robbed the road again.
<br><br>So Yi Feng did not wait for them to strike, pretending that I am more ruthless than you, pretending to make you can not afford to mess with the appearance.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Opposite goose, directly avoid a trouble.
<br><br>It seems.
<br><br>People still have to be a little fierce ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng wrapped up his cotton clothes, and after taking a look at the map, he rushed in the direction of Baier City.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked for a long, long time before the four figures came out from the middle of the First Line Valley with bitter faces.
<br><br>"That knife just now, so terrifying!"
<br><br>"En, when that knife came out, my soul was trembling, and the Yuan Qi in my body stopped running."
<br><br>"You guys say, could this be the senior of Guan Tang City?"
<br><br>"You don't say, it's really possible, otherwise how could an existence of this realm appear two in the North Sea at the same time?"
<br><br>"It seems to be true!"
<br><br>"But even if it's that senior, what's the use, he doesn't want to see us at all!"
<br><br>"Who says it isn't? I thought I would be able to mix a face, but it turns out I didn't even get a good look at him."
<br><br>"Alas, after so many days of hard work, the relationship of high people did not take, other hair did not get a."
<br><br>"Blame you, thousands of years old woman painted what rouge, it must be that senior look disgusted, just do not see us."
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian, I think you are looking for death."
<br><br>"Humph, did I say it wrong."
<br><br>"I'll kill you!"
<br><br>"All right, all right, stop arguing."
<br><br>"That's it, what's all the noise, let's just hurry back to Baier City to return to the Hall and repair for a while."
<br><br>In this way, sighing and sighing, the four accompanied by the sound of cursing and swearing again, fell down and flew towards Baier City.
<br><br>"I don't know which some forces are recruiting in this Baier City."
<br><br>"We can only take our chances."
<br><br>Yi Feng walked on the streets of Baier City and then came to the location in the center of the city.
<br><br>Then his eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Return to the first sect."
<br><br>"This place looks like the recruitment point of the sect."
<br><br>"Although the name of the sect, Gui Yi Hall, is slightly crotchety, but it's okay to be able to blend in."
<br><br>Yi Feng then walked into the Gui Yi Hall.
<br><br>In the inner hall of Gui Yi Hall.
<br><br>Li Canghai four people sat with gloomy faces.
<br><br>And although Jian Hengtian and Liu Gu Yi had subsided, the eyes of both sides were still glaring at each other.
<br><br>"Just now I took a glance at the list of disciples recruited by the Returned Hall, and there was not a single bright presence." Li Canghai said with a sigh.
<br><br>"Who says no, this North Sea's genius disciples are getting fewer and fewer ah, and I don't know if this is the case in other regions!"
<br><br>"The situation in Baier City is actually expected, ever since our four clans joined together to open this homecoming entrance to recruit disciples in Baier City, we have never received a decent disciple."
<br><br>"Yes, why don't we just remove this homecoming group?"
<br><br>"There is no need, can recruit a little is a little, usually our four sects outside training disciples come here, is also considered to have a landing place."
<br><br>Just when the four sect masters were discussing matters, outside the hall, the sound of arguing came out.
<br><br>"What's going on outside, why is it so noisy?"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi couldn't help but drink.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>A disciple outside quickly ran in and knelt down in front of the four and said, "Report to the four patriarchs, a mortal came outside, without any talent, it's useless to talk to him, he insists on joining our four sects."
<br><br>"Another mortal?"
<br><br>The four of them looked at each other.
<br><br>Previously, they met a mortal in Guan Tang City who insisted on joining the four sects, and now there was another one?
