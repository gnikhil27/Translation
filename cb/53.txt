"Rest in peace."
<br><br>"Calm down your anger, Master."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er's face changed greatly, and hastily stopped Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"Why are you stopping me, this person is really deceitful, simply too much to put my Xuanwu Sect in the eyes, quickly get out of my way." Ning Xuanwu shouted angrily, he could not wait to rush in and raze that martial hall to the ground.
<br><br>"Master, be calm, be careful there is a fraud!" Demon Ling'er said in a serious tone, "It is likely that he hung the Swift Cloak there deliberately to provoke our reaction, and then planted a trap, if Master really fell for it ......"
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu gazed at him.
<br><br>"If the master fell for it, then he really fell into the trap of that miscreant, it is likely that the two senior brothers of that day also stepped into the trap in the same way." Seeing that Ning Xuanwu hesitated, Demon Ling'er continued to solemnly persuade.
<br><br>At these words, Ning Xuanwu also suddenly reacted.
<br><br>This provocation, is not the intention is very obvious?
<br><br>Can't help but. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>A flash of backwardness also surged on his face.
<br><br>"Rash."
<br><br>He sighed, holding back his anger to see his gaze on the dead soldier's body.
<br><br>"Don't worry, my father's word is good, so go with confidence and boldness." Ning Xuanwu said, "The honorable and arduous problem of spying on the martial school will be left to you."
<br><br>The young dead soldier gritted his teeth, "Please rest assured, Sovereign, I promise to complete the task."
<br><br>"Remember, never draw that person's attention or reveal any hostile intent, spying is the main focus." Demon Ling'er solemnly reminded again, "Be sure to be careful and cautious."
<br><br>The dead soldier nodded, then under the gaze of Ning Xuanwu and others, walked cautiously towards that martial arts hall.
<br><br>Nearing the entrance, he stopped for a moment.
<br><br>The swift cloak was used as a rag just to hang out next to him.
<br><br>The Zhentian stone, right under his feet.
<br><br>Holding back his nervousness and breathing a huge sigh of relief, he crossed over the Earthquake Stone.
<br><br>It was a bit of a rip-off.
<br><br>Suddenly, he kind of understood why this person inside, why he had put the Heaven-shattering stone here to fill the steps.
<br><br>Then one step.
<br><br>Stepped into the front hall.
<br><br>Inside was mediocre, nothing outstanding, no different from ordinary martial arts schools, and even, not as good as other martial arts schools.
<br><br>Nor, it seemed, was there any danger.
<br><br>"Disciple, why did you take down this plaque as well?" In the courtyard, Yi Feng jerked his dog while asking towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Master, I saw that it was quite dusty, so I took it down and wiped it off, but there are still some water stains on it, so I put it here to dry for the time being, and I will put it back on after it dries." Zhong Qing answered softly.
<br><br>"Well, not bad."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded appreciatively, this Zhong Qing was much more attentive than him, and did everything in place.
<br><br>"Excuse me, is anyone there?"
<br><br>Just at that moment, a voice came from the front hall.
<br><br>"Huh, is there a guest?"
<br><br>The voice wasn't familiar, which made Yi Feng a little surprised.
<br><br>Here he was, it had been a long time since business had come. Getting up and walking out, he found that it was a youth similar to himself, and couldn't help but ask, "Hello, may I ask what's the matter?"
<br><br>And the dead soldier saw Yi Feng, the heart also immediately shuddered, demon spirit of the sister is afraid that this is the person said, right?
<br><br>Sweat, could not help but wet the back.
<br><br>But he still forced himself to calmly ask: "Hello, may I ask how to go to Xuanwu Sect?"
<br><br>But even if he was cautious, there were times when he was negligent, and the Xuanwu Clan almost came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"It's over."
<br><br>He secretly said, becoming bloodless, because once these words came out, wouldn't it mean that his identity was exposed?
<br><br>For a while, his eyes shrunk into pinholes as he looked nervously at Yi Feng, and had even thought of a situation where Yi Feng would slap him to death.
<br><br>But however.
<br><br>Yi Feng did not make any move, the heart is even a little disappointed.
<br><br>So it is asking for directions, ah, thought it was to buy something or door to door to worship the master, he opened this martial arts school is too failure, but happy to help his face did not show anything, then politely towards him to tell the approximate road.
<br><br>Yi Feng's blandness was beyond the dead soldier's expectation.
<br><br>There is actually no reaction?
<br><br>I showed such a big breach actually no reaction?
<br><br>He was a bit confused.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng, flat and ordinary like a mortal, this ...... really is a master?
<br><br>It seems that the patriarch and they seem to have guessed wrong ah, this is not any expert at all, but a mediocre mortal ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, he simply bold some, said: "You here, quite cold ah, I'm afraid there are not many disciples, right?"
<br><br>After saying that, his eyes shrunk into pinholes as he looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>I have to say, can be sent as a dead soldier to spy here, he has enough guts, but also has a lot of heart, despite the previous reveal of the mistake, but does not affect the play of his heart.
<br><br>He said, also asked the right thing.
<br><br>On the bright side with a hint of mockery, if he really predicted wrong, this person is really a master, will certainly reveal what move, such as angry, reveal the momentum shocking glare, etc. ......
<br><br>Likewise, he also left himself a way out, because the words, not to let the other side straight down to kill.
<br><br>And if there is no reaction, that side shows that this person is really not a master of anything.
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng face is a little unnatural.
<br><br>But this buddy is really good, he is so cold in this store, he has nothing to say.
<br><br>"Sure enough."
<br><br>The dead man who sized up Yi Feng saw this, his heart could not help but sneer, this person did not have any moves, nor half of all the things that an expert has, and his heart was immediately defined.
<br><br>Demon Ling'er and Ning Xuanwu wrong assessment, this is a mortal without the slightest strength.
<br><br>And the death of the two brothers without dust and wind, I am afraid that there is also some kind of misunderstanding.
<br><br>He boldly exchanged a few more pleasantries and sauntered out without encountering any danger, and by now, he had even more confirmation of what he had in mind.
<br><br>He was also quite proud of himself for this line.
