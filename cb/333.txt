She backed up violently on her paws.
<br><br>Only when she had retreated to the back corner and could not retreat any further did she brace her palms against the wall and breathe heavily.
<br><br>And the pair of beautiful eyes, but with a wide gesture, looking at the group of old men on the beef stall.
<br><br>As far as the eye could see.
<br><br>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ......
<br><br>Eight.
<br><br>The whole eight.
<br><br>She felt in the bodies of the eight old men, the kind of throbbing that only happens in a divine body.
<br><br>That is to say.
<br><br>The eight old men in front of her.
<br><br>All of them were divine bodies. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>She was dumbfounded.
<br><br>She couldn't breathe for a while.
<br><br>Not to mention the three divine bodies just now, now there are eight more, this together, a full eleven divine bodies.
<br><br>Eleven divine bodies!
<br><br>Oh my God.
<br><br>She had a strong illusion that the world she was in was no longer the original world, because what was happening in front of her was too unreal.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>The constant throbbing coming from her divine phoenix body made her understand.
<br><br>This was all real.
<br><br>"The soup!"
<br><br>"There's something wrong with the soup."
<br><br>Almost instantly, she and comprehended that there was something wrong with that so-called bullwhip soup.
<br><br>Because before the soup, she did not feel the slightest throbbing in these old men's bodies at all.
<br><br>And the time when the stirring of the divine phoenix physique appeared was all after they drank the soup.
<br><br>In other words.
<br><br>That bullwhip soup, in a short period of time, transformed these people's physique collectively, transforming them into the ancient divine physique.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but get excited.
<br><br>She must see what kind of soup it was that was actually able to create divine bodies in bulk.
<br><br>And just what kind of person was it that could create this kind of soup!
<br><br>Was it that mortal Yi Feng?
<br><br>She really couldn't believe it.
<br><br>So she had to find out what was going on.
<br><br>So, she walked quickly towards the beef stall.
<br><br>"Stop it, you guys."
<br><br>Looking at these few old mortal pikers still wolfing down the soup, completely unaware of what the soup in front of her represented, Bai Lengxi's aura was revealed and her voice was transmitted directly towards several people.
<br><br>And in her opinion.
<br><br>Show qi is the most effective way to deal with mortals.
<br><br>Also the most save words.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What she didn't expect was that, in the face of her voice and the pervasive aura, these few old men didn't even look at her.
<br><br>"This soup, it's really good."
<br><br>"Yes, I have never tasted such a good soup in my life."
<br><br>"Sir is so righteous, tomorrow I have to hurry up and bring two pieces of tofu to the door."
<br><br>"Then help me bring two pieces of ribs to your door as well."
<br><br>While drinking the soup, several old men chatted idly with each other.
<br><br>But this.
<br><br>But let Bai Lengxi pretty face covered with frost.
<br><br>Is the cultivator's breath invalid, or are these mortal old men blind?
<br><br>The first time I thought of this, her body's aura was raised again, and at the same time the long sword in her hand was out.
<br><br>"Clang."
<br><br>The long sword plunged straight into the feet of a few old men, emitting a sound of sword chirping.
<br><br>Several old men who were chatting finally frowned.
<br><br>Turned their eyes over.
<br><br>"Little girl, do you want something?"
<br><br>Old Zheng from the vegetable market couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"I want to take away this pot of soup."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi said expressionlessly.
<br><br>After saying that, her jade hand reached out and was going to take the pot.
<br><br>"Eh, little girl, you grab the soup that we old people drink, do you know how to love the old and young ah!" Seeing this, the tobacco seller old Zhou knocked the long pipe in his hand over and frowned and lectured.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face was chilled.
<br><br>A bunch of pedantic mortals.
<br><br>However, she was too lazy to be ordinary with this group of mortals and took out a pile of gold and silver treasures from her storage ring and threw them on the table.
<br><br>"It's okay, right?"
<br><br>After saying that, she was about to get the pot again.
<br><br>But the old Zhao head put the lid on the pot and said leisurely, "Girl, we old men are half in the ground, we don't need the gold, silver and treasure, so you'd better leave quickly, don't come to interfere with our old men's life in their old age."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This action directly enraged Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>She never expected that a few mortal old men would be so shameless.
<br><br>She was already giving enough face as a Martial Emperor powerhouse.
<br><br>"It seems that you guys are toasting the wine and not eating the punishment."
<br><br>The long sword in her hand came together, her aura leaked out without reservation, and she said with a face full of cold light, "Today this soup, whether you agree or disagree, I will take it away."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What she didn't expect was that, in the face of the outburst of her aura, these old men were not afraid at all, but stood up in unison.
<br><br>Turning a pair of profound gazes, they stared at her.
<br><br>"When did a milquetoast little girl dare to spill her guts in front of us old men?"
<br><br>Accompanied by a cold snort from Old Head Zhou, an aura that made her feel trembling was released from the bodies of the eight old men at the same time.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face changed greatly.
<br><br>Her pupils widened.
<br><br>It was because each of these eight auras made her feel desperate, and each of them made her feel her soul tremble.
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Her feet were suppressed by this aura and she retreated backwards, and almost instantly, a mouthful of fresh blood was spat out.
<br><br>Ten lives.
<br><br>It was actually Ten Life Martial Emperors.
<br><br>Eight Ten Life Martial Emperors.
<br><br>Gutted, she instantly understood the cultivation of these eight old men, which sent a chill down her spine.
<br><br>She, Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>To actually spill her guts in front of eight Ten Life Martial Emperors, how unlucky was she to have stepped on such a thick iron plate!
<br><br>"Seniors spare my life."
<br><br>She hurriedly bowed her body, turning from her high and mighty stance to humble to the extreme in an instant.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Another angry grunt caused her mind to suffer a heavy blow, and a mouthful of blood spurted out.
<br><br>But she still kept her head down, not daring to make the slightest movement.
<br><br>"When did a little Seventh Life Martial Emperor dare to spread wildness in Pingjiang City?" Old Zhao Tau lectured in a deep voice, and with a wave of his palm, another heavy blow landed on Bai Lengxi's chest.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi flew backwards, then hurriedly got up again, lowering his head and not daring to move.
<br><br>The deterrent effect caused by the eight Ten Life Martial Emperors was too powerful.
<br><br>It can be said that when they go out, the entire Immortal River Continent will have to tremble.
<br><br>Even if she, Bai Lengxi, is more arrogant and has a greater status, in front of these old men, she does not dare to breathe.
<br><br>What she just couldn't figure out was that eight Ten Life Martial Emperors would be piling up in unison here?
<br><br>"Speak for yourself, what to do with you."
<br><br>Old Qian Tou said coldly.
<br><br>"I hope you seniors will bear with me, it's my junior who has no eyes, spare my life." Bai Lengxi lowered his head and said.
<br><br>"We bear with it?"
<br><br>"Heh ......"
<br><br>The old Zhao head sneered and said in a deep voice: "It's a small matter that you offended us, but if you are spreading wildness in front of Mr.'s martial school, it's not a matter of tolerance."
<br><br>"Sir?"
<br><br>"Martial arts school?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face changed.
<br><br>Instantly, he understood that they were talking about Yi Feng.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>Wasn't he a mortal?
<br><br>No, no, no.
<br><br>She desperately shook her head.
<br><br>If the eight Ten Life Martial Emperors all addressed Yi Feng respectfully as sir, then she would be foolish if she still thought that Yi Feng was a mortal.
<br><br>It dawned on her.
<br><br>Yi Feng was not a mortal at all, but she was just too short-sighted to recognize it before.
<br><br>"So he, what exactly is he?"
<br><br>She clenched her shell teeth and couldn't help but raise her head and ask, "And this soup, did it come from his hand?"
<br><br>"Hmph, in this world, who can make such a soup except Mr.?"
<br><br>The old head of Zhou drank: "As for who he really is, are you a little Seventh Life Martial enough to ask about it?"
