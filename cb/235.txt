"What?"
<br><br>Hearing this, Li Shuhua and the others uttered a shocked voice and asked urgently, "You mean to say that that is the senior who gave you the incense bag?"
<br><br>"It's him, it's him, this back figure I will never forget." Li Renhao said with clenched shell teeth.
<br><br>Li Shuhua and the others were shocked.
<br><br>Then, bitter laughter came out.
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder he said that the incense bag was his.
<br><br>"According to what you guys said, I'm afraid senior knows what happened by this incense bag. I guess, he is very disappointed with us, he can't even hold the chance to give us the chance, but also caused such trouble ......" At this time, Li Jiaxin said with a complicated face.
<br><br>"I think he must have come here on purpose this time to solve this mess and retrieve the incense bag by the way ......"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd was fiercely shocked. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This mysteriously came, first to save them in the fire, then will be Song Ke point to strike, and finally to retrieve the incense pouch ......
<br><br>This series of retrospectively.
<br><br>I'm afraid, it's really so ah!
<br><br>Can not help but, the crowd bitter hard to say, only sigh.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>Gradually passed.
<br><br>Unknowingly, the winter has passed a large part.
<br><br>This weather, Yi Feng is not want to go anywhere, just want to stay at home as a salted fish.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng found that the recent Zhong Qing is a bit abnormal.
<br><br>Usually in the martial arts school inside the head to practice his kung fu, recently always leave early and return late, and often sit under the eaves giggling.
<br><br>With doubts, Yi Feng wanted to see what the boy was doing.
<br><br>Following the movement, Yi Feng walked lightly towards the kitchen.
<br><br>Just walked into the kitchen, he saw Zhong Qing carrying a plate of lard to the mirror to wipe his hair, until the entire hair will be wiped with the amount of oil, he was satisfied with nodding his head.
<br><br>Afterwards, and then picked up a handful of rapeseed flowers on the side, will be carefully tied and clamped in the arms, and then ready to go out.
<br><br>Head-on, ran into Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing lowered his head, panicking.
<br><br>"Yo, you're a pig running in circles, in heat!" Yi Feng looked at him and laughed meaningfully.
<br><br>"No, no."
<br><br>Zhong Qing blushed, hid the rape flowers behind him, and ran out the door with his head down.
<br><br>But this kind of day did not last long, and Zhong Qing never went out again.
<br><br>Instead, he spent the whole day inside the martial arts school with a sad face, sometimes silent for a whole day without saying a word.
<br><br>Looking at this child is getting thinner and thinner, Yi Feng heart is not a taste.
<br><br>"Disciple, accompany me to drink."
<br><br>Yi Feng took out a pot of good wine, got two plates of peanut rice, and shouted towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Master, but didn't you not let me drink before?" Zhong Qing asked in confusion.
<br><br>"Now you can."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and poured a cup full towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Zhong Qing carefully drank it down, choked twice, and his spicy little face turned red.
<br><br>"What's the matter, talk to Master!"
<br><br>Yi Feng poured another cup for him.
<br><br>Zhong Qing lowered his head and did not speak.
<br><br>"Disciple, life in the world, some things will always be experienced, really can not pass things, there will always be a solution." Yi Feng raised his glass of wine toward Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"Master, I, I ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing lowered his head and hesitated.
<br><br>Seeing Zhong Qing's appearance, Yi Feng sighed and said, "Disciple, remember that I am your master and your relative."
<br><br>This sentence of relatives immediately made Zhong Qing lose control of his emotions and shed tears.
<br><br>Now he choked up and told the story: "Master, I, I really like Mengtian, and we have agreed that when we grow up a little more, I will go to her family to propose marriage, but, but her aunt stopped me and told me that Mengtian is the daughter of a big family in Nansha, it is impossible to be with a grassroots like me."
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"Master I feel so bad, my heart hurts so much, her aunt even called me a waste, said if I really go to find Meng Tian, I have to break my legs!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When Yi Feng heard this, he was instantly angry.
<br><br>He had thought that Zhong Qing was simply emotionally frustrated, but he didn't expect there to be such a story.
<br><br>And calling his disciple a loser?
<br><br>This fucking couldn't be tolerated.
<br><br>"Damn pulling a ba Zi, said my baby disciple waste ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng is the more you think, the more angry, the more you think, the hands of the glass of wine a drop, drink: "disciple, do not cry, this matter master to you make the decision, the big family is it, I want to see what big family, and so on the spring master will take you to propose marriage."
<br><br>"Master!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing trembled and looked at Yi Feng with tears in his eyes.
<br><br>"So decided, really think that your master is now poor pussy? You have to remember, as my disciple you are no worse than anyone else, people live a breath, at that time you should have disliked back with that old witch!" Yi Feng said angrily, and then began to open up his gold coins.
<br><br>In addition to the under the bed, under the tree, and inside the ring, Baofeng Chamber of Commerce Yi Feng also saved a lot, and every month there is a share of money from the sale of books.
<br><br>Of course, there are a few sacks seized from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Damn, I see what you big family, I take gold coins smashing also to smash you."
<br><br>Looking at the beginning of spring also only a few days left, Yi Feng began to open up.
<br><br>First, he found Wu Yonghong and Lu Dasheng and several of them.
<br><br>"What is the order, sir."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng come to them, the four people immediately came respectfully.
<br><br>"There is a matter that needs your help." Yi Feng said, "Recently you guys put down the work in hand and go to Nansha with me, as for the pay, you can't be treated badly."
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng speak with a hint of anger, several people immediately rose and answered: "Sir, you are welcome, we do not want any remuneration, because sir's matter is our matter!"
<br><br>"Good, it's a deal."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Thinking that it was still not right, he ran to Pork Rong again.
<br><br>Because this trip over, the money can not bring less, but the momentum can not be too weak, after all, to Zhong Qing to support the scene always have to have people.
<br><br>Although the number of Wu Yonghong and the four of them is enough, but is always some bad old man, the momentum is certainly not enough.
<br><br>And this guy Porky Rong is good.
<br><br>As a neighborhood neighbor, pork rong also has no opinion, directly agreed to Yi Feng.
<br><br>After taking care of these things, Yi Feng went to the street and rented a carriage and several horses according to the head, which was ready.
<br><br>This day.
<br><br>Zodiac day.
<br><br>Yi Feng ready to go.
<br><br>And Pork Rong, Wu Yonghong, Lu Dasheng, Chu Mad Lion, Sun Zhuge and others also came to the gate early as promised.
<br><br>"Here!"
<br><br>Then as they waited, Yi Feng held out a pile of weapons from the martial arts school and threw them on the ground.
<br><br>"Everyone pick the same one that you are comfortable with!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Several people immediately drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>The appearance of these knives is ordinary, ordinary people are afraid that really think it is an ordinary knife, and only with their cultivation to look carefully, can slightly find the magic of these weapons.
<br><br>But even so, actually can not see the grade.
<br><br>This is, truly back to the basics of the divine weapons, what holy products in front of them is also dregs!
<br><br>The crowd excitedly one person picked a piece, then sat on the horses.
<br><br>"You, drive the carriage for me."
<br><br>Yi Feng kicked Skeleton Ben Wei, and after that, he took the dog and also Zhong Qing, and went up towards the horse.
<br><br>Yi Feng was just about to get into the carriage, when suddenly came a shout.
<br><br>"Sir, wait a minute."
<br><br>"Old Wang Tau, it's you!"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the person who came, and immediately probed and shouted.
<br><br>"Sir, I heard that you are going to Nansha for business, the old man just came to ask if there is anything that needs the old man, anyway, the old man is bored sitting at home, so he can accompany you to go for a trip." Old Wang propped up his cane and said with a smile.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng slightly thought about it.
<br><br>This old man to support the momentum, fighting or something certainly not, but this kind of old man lived a long time, know more, in that kind of occasion certainly help to say.
<br><br>"OK old king head, then thank you, get on the carriage!" Yi Feng waved his hand and shouted.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Old Wang Tau grinned, revealing a big mouth with missing incisors, and diligently boarded the carriage.
<br><br>"Sir, setting out?"
<br><br>Pork Rong and Wu Yonghong, who were in the lead in front, asked.
<br><br>"Well, depart, but I still want to remind everyone before we leave."
<br><br>Yi Feng said solemnly, "This is a long journey, in this kind of immortal cultivation world, we as a mortal must know how to keep a low profile and try not to cause trouble, got it?"
<br><br>At these words, the people looked at each other and nodded unspokenly.
<br><br>"Rack!"
<br><br>With a yell, five horses and a carriage just left Pingjiang City and headed for the distant Nansha.
<br><br>"The scenery outside this city, it's really good!"
<br><br>The sun was shining, the weather was soothing, sitting on the carriage, Yi Feng looked at the scenery outside through the window and felt great comfort.
<br><br>After crossing over for so long, it was the first time he really went out of town.
<br><br>And I wonder, what is it really like in Nansha.
<br><br>"Stand still ......"
<br><br>Just then, the sound of scolding came from ahead.
<br><br>Then, Pork Rong and Wu Yonghong, who were in the lead, stopped.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the cloth curtain to look forward and immediately found a sword-wielding woman in green stopping in front of the carriage.
<br><br>Her face was icy cold and her figure was tall, so she was not an ordinary person at first glance.
<br><br>Only her face was a little pale, and at the shoulder, there were still traces of undried blood left behind, so she was obviously seriously injured.
<br><br>"I need to take your carriage to the Nansha range."
<br><br>At this time, the woman in green said in a cold voice: "Of course, not in vain, this journey of mountain bandits, including many cultivators to stop the road robbery, if there is me and you as a companion, when to ensure that you mortals without worry!"
<br><br>At these words, the pork rong and Wu Yonghong and other people in front of them have a complicated face.
<br><br>Guarantee them no worries?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They did not dare to take the liberty of looking at Yi Feng.
