"What?"
<br><br>Ye Yi's words could be described as a stone that set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>Falling on their ears, it resounded like an explosive thunder, causing the crowd present to be like pillars, stunned in place.
<br><br>Spiral.
<br><br>It actually died?
<br><br>"Yi'er, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Night Energy stared in disbelief and hurriedly asked, "Did you make a mistake, how could it be possible for the Seven Great Martial Emperors to die?"
<br><br>"Yes, who could have killed them?"
<br><br>"And how do you know that?"
<br><br>The rest of the people were also talking and turned their anxious eyes towards Ye Yi.
<br><br>"You don't have to doubt, because I witnessed their deaths with my own eyes." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Speaking of this, Ye Yi took a deep breath, and her mind could not help but recall the white-robed figure she saw at that time, before saying in awe, "And the one who killed them was a supreme power with monstrous means."
<br><br>"A supreme power?"
<br><br>The crowd's eyes widened.
<br><br>"Not bad, a supreme power."
<br><br>Ye Yi repeated solemnly.
<br><br>"He was out of the world and out of mortality, like a god walking in the world, he was so powerful that the organization was crushed in his hands like a mole."
<br><br>Ye Yi recalled everything, at the same time point by point, all that happened before, depicted one by one with Night Energy and others.
<br><br>"With mortal means, he killed seven people."
<br><br>"Low-key means, back to the basics, such means are indeed the ultimate greatness."
<br><br>Hearing Ye Yi's description, Night Energy and the others were also none but submissive, as if they had also seen the scene that happened at that time with their own eyes.
<br><br>And the crowd also exclaimed in ecstasy, the gloom on their faces disappeared.
<br><br>It was also never thought that the crisis of his night family was lifted just like that.
<br><br>"Yi'er, where is that senior, you must take me to pay my respects to him, to thank him for saving the life of my night family." Night can language urgently said, he can't wait to meet this senior.
<br><br>"He seems to have gone to Guan Tang City." Ye Yi said softly.
<br><br>"Official Pond City, good, Yi'er, let's immediately leave for Official Pond City and pay respect to this senior." Night Energy trembled his palms and transmitted his voice.
<br><br>After saying that, was not half delayed, took Ye Yi and rushed towards Guan Tang City.
<br><br>Two hours passed.
<br><br>The long queue in the central square of Guan Tang City was finally tested.
<br><br>But even so, after Yi Feng, there were only a few more people.
<br><br>"Quiet."
<br><br>Finally, an officiating one stepped onto the high platform, pressed his palm, and sent out a rolling thunder sound.
<br><br>The entire noisy square was instantly quiet.
<br><br>"Congratulations to all of you, who have become the candidates to be chosen."
<br><br>"Without incident, you people will be absorbed into my four sects and become one of the disciples."
<br><br>The principal glanced around at Yi Feng and the others and passed out his voice.
<br><br>The crowd of those to be selected stirred, and the faces of the green children were filled with excitement.
<br><br>"Stand at attention and wait for the selection."
<br><br>The main messenger bellowed, then turned to respectfully look at the sky behind him and bent down, "Please also ask the four great patriarchs to select."
<br><br>As his voice fell, the entire square raised their heads to look into the sky.
<br><br>At once, they found that in the sky of the square, four human figures appeared at some unknown time.
<br><br>They stood in the air, their robes windless.
<br><br>That aura alone was full of compulsion, and attracted countless awe-inspiring gazes.
<br><br>But only three men and one woman could be seen, and it was impossible to see their true appearance clearly, a hazy piece, obviously shielded by their own power.
<br><br>And they, it is the North Sea four sects of the patriarch.
<br><br>Four clans are the hegemon of the North Sea, respectively, Canghai Mountain, Hengtian Sword Fast, Cloud Dragon Valley, Taiyi Valley.
<br><br>Collectively, one mountain, one fast and two valleys.
<br><br>"The disciples absorbed this time, really ......"
<br><br>Canghai Mountain patriarch swept a glance at the crowd to be selected and shook his head.
<br><br>"Yes, I can't imagine that our four sects have fallen to the point of recruiting such disciples." Patriarch Heng Tian Jian Zhai likewise shook his head.
<br><br>"Although the Immortal River Continent has fallen into decline since the ancient changes, but it's not to this extent, but this few years I have fewer and fewer talented disciples in the North Sea, it always feels like things are unusual." Taiyi Valley Patriarch as the only female of the four, the mind is more acute, said the heart of the concern.
<br><br>"I feel unusual too."
<br><br>Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch agreed and said, "Looking back, the first few years we were able to receive at least some talented disciples, but these two years, is not a single one to see, there is always a feeling of being a frog boiled in warm water, as if for some reason, resulting in fewer and fewer talented disciples."
<br><br>Four people silent.
<br><br>Always feel the North Sea shrouded in a thick layer of fog, so they can not see through, can not touch.
<br><br>"That's all, let's not discuss this, tell us, how to assign these disciples?" Taiyi Valley Patriarch asked.
<br><br>"These disciples I probably swept a glance, almost all are the lowest level of talent, unless there is an accident, most of them will not have much success, so we do not have any need to fight for it, just distribute it!" Hengtian Jianzhai patriarch casually said.
<br><br>The rest of the people nodded, obviously had no opinion.
<br><br>Then, the Hengtian Sword Saisai Patriarch was the first to transmit his voice, and dully drank: "The row in the front row, then join my Hengtian Sword Saisai!"
<br><br>When the voice fell, there were people from the Heng Tian Jian Zhai who began to register them.
<br><br>The first row of disciples immediately revealed a look of excitement.
<br><br>"The second row, then join my Taiyi Valley!"
<br><br>The Taiyi Valley Patriarch then sent out his voice.
<br><br>"The third row, then join me, Canghai Mountain!"
<br><br>The Canghai Mountain Patriarch also followed.
<br><br>As their voices fell, the management of the two sects also began to register them.
<br><br>"Aaaaahhh, I never thought it would go so smoothly!"
<br><br>And Yi Feng, who was standing in the last row, was excited to the extreme, he had thought that he had to pick them one by one to join their sect, but he didn't expect it to be so hasty.
<br><br>So, it seemed that their last row should be arranged to the last sect directly, just like the first three rows.
<br><br>As expected, the voice of the Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch also fell.
<br><br>"Those in the fourth row, then join my Cloud Dragon Valley!"
<br><br>The disciples in the fourth row revealed their excitement, and of course the most excited one was Yi Feng.
<br><br>He also did not expect that this trip to the North Sea would go so well.
<br><br>Now, finally, the dust had settled.
<br><br>After hanging around here for a while and returning to East Victory, he could get the qualification to build the sect, then fool the disciples, complete the system quests, and head towards the path of cultivation to become a real human being.
<br><br>"Wait!"
<br><br>However, just as Yi Feng was planning everything in his mind for the future, the voice of the Cloud Dragon Valley Patriarch came again, "The one in white clothes is not among them."
<br><br>"The one in white?"
<br><br>The disciples in the fourth row stirred and searched for the one in white clothes.
<br><br>Yi Feng searched around and didn't see it, but found that the crowd had landed their eyes on him.
<br><br>A bad premonition appeared in Yi Feng's heart.
<br><br>Looked down.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Wearing white clothes, it was himself!
