Yi Feng lying on the recliner, remembering that in the future out there is a Reincarnation Immortal Realm big brother cover, then feel beautiful.
<br><br>However, one is not enough.
<br><br>It would be better if there were a few more.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>He turned his gaze to Gong Chen who was hoeing the grass.
<br><br>"Gong Chen, it's like this, I'm new to the Immortal Realm and need a group of manpower." He spoke leisurely.
<br><br>"Sir, what do you mean?"
<br><br>Gong Chen put down his hoe and stared at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Could it be that ......
<br><br>Could it be that this one was laying some kind of game?
<br><br>"Good, so you see this island, there are no other immortal cultivators you know, to pull me over?" Yi Feng asked with a smirk. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Gong Chen was secretly surprised that his guess was good.
<br><br>Heart in this moment also set a goal, must be good performance, the future may have the opportunity to become the right arm of this one.
<br><br>"May I ask if the gentleman has any requirements for the candidate?" Gong Chen asked.
<br><br>"Requirements."
<br><br>Yi Feng stroked his chin and said leisurely, "The only requirement is that the one who is almost as bad as you mix, and the other who is not too bad in character."
<br><br>After all, he thought, his only advantage at present, is to be able to eat on the island, do not have to sleep in the wind.
<br><br>And if the island would have been mixed can, certainly not follow him. If you are as hungry as Gong Chen into skin and bones, that for a bucket of rice to bend, or more realistic.
<br><br>As for the character, that is even more needless to say.
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>Gong Chen bowed his head and answered.
<br><br>But with a bitter smile on his face.
<br><br>He was at least a Reincarnation Immortal Realm, an existence above ten thousand people outside, but in the eyes of his seniors, he was only poorly mixed.
<br><br>The pattern of the two, the difference is not a star and a half ah!
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>At the same time, he also understood that the senior's requirements for this candidate, I'm afraid the minimum is also the Reincarnation Immortal realm.
<br><br>"As far as I know, there are indeed quite a few hidden experts on the island, and the strength, well, is similar to mine." Gong Chen said.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Then did you find it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Because all in this island, outside also slightly friends, so also considered to find."
<br><br>"Only, they are afraid that they are now in a state of lingering, not necessarily able to serve senior too much." Gong Chen said worriedly.
<br><br>"It's okay to linger, isn't it me?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart is secretly happy, he wants this kind of state, not this kind of state, it is not good to handle it.
<br><br>"Also, there is Mr. In pour I overthink."
<br><br>Gong Chen gave a bitter smile.
<br><br>Before he is not also exhausted, the state of the mountain is exhausted?
<br><br>It's not just a vulture neck that takes care of things.
<br><br>"Senior, so I'll go now?" Gong Chen said respectfully.
<br><br>"Go ahead, remember, the more the better."
<br><br>Yi Feng explained with a smile.
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>Gong Chen retreated.
<br><br>The next time, Gong Chen followed Yi Feng's instructions and started wandering around the island, looking for some old acquaintances he had met on the island over the years.
<br><br>......
<br><br>Jiang Zhi, dressed in red, looked at the black sea in the distance.
<br><br>Beautiful eyes dripping with resentment.
<br><br>It shows painful hatred.
<br><br>The thought of staying on this island for endless years to come and being slowly ground to death, she tightly tugged up her fists and trembled violently.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She felt that she still had a ray of hope.
<br><br>That was the mysterious person who hunted the demon wolf.
<br><br>Over the past few days, she had seen hundreds of demon wolf corpses.
<br><br>And besides the corpses, those demon wolves that usually made her avoid them, she couldn't even find one by actively looking for them.
<br><br>As if.
<br><br>The demon wolves on this island had been killed by that person and were almost extinct.
<br><br>In this cruel environment, to be able to do all this, this kind of strength, is simply beyond her imagination.
<br><br>If one could get to know him, one might be able to persevere on the island until the day when one goes out in the future ......
<br><br>She was about to leave.
<br><br>Suddenly found the sky wild wind blowing.
<br><br>She raised her head in horror and instantly found an old man stepping through the air in mid-air.
<br><br>And with his cloudy appearance, he didn't seem to be afraid of the erosion of the brutal air at all, let alone suffering a backlash.
<br><br>Her beautiful eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Could it be, could it be that he is the mysterious expert who killed the demon wolf?"
<br><br>This kind of ignoring the brutal air, other than that mysterious person, she could not think of anyone else who could do it.
<br><br>She was too excited for words.
<br><br>It was really a great effort to step through the iron shoes and find a place.
<br><br>She hurriedly chased after him and shouted, "Senior, wait."
<br><br>Gong Chen, who had flown all the way through to find a candidate for Yi Feng, noticed Jiang Zhi's presence, frowned slightly, and stopped.
<br><br>"The strength of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm, not a lot of brutal power in the body, should have just been shut in not long ago."
<br><br>Gong Chen looked at Jiang Zhi in front of him and instantly had a certain understanding of her in his heart.
<br><br>"What do you want?" He asked.
<br><br>"I am Jiang Zhi, I have met senior." Jiang Zhi said respectfully, "The late senior has come to also want to make friends with senior."
<br><br>"Gong Chen."
<br><br>Gong Chen nodded, after all, it was also an expert of the Reincarnation Immortal Realm who took the initiative to make friends, so he responded quite politely.
<br><br>"Greetings senior Gong."
<br><br>If she could make friends with him, I'm afraid she could be greatly facilitated on the island, so she continued, "Senior Gong, which Immortal continent are you from, and what are you imprisoned for?"
<br><br>"I'm just a casual person."
<br><br>Gong Chen said indifferently, glancing at the distance, remembering Yi Feng's explanation, he did not have the heart to talk with Jiang Zhi in depth.
<br><br>So he said, "Right now I have things to do, if there is an opportunity later, let's talk again!"
<br><br>After saying that, he was ready to leave.
<br><br>This made Jiang Zhi look lost.
<br><br>Indeed, she was so presumptuous to come forward, why should people befriend you.
<br><br>But when she was full of disappointment, Gong Chen gave her another jade slip before he left.
<br><br>"This jade slip has my breath on it, in the future there is an opportunity ...... maybe I will look for you."
<br><br>Gong Chen solemnly explained.
<br><br>After all, he remembered Yi Feng's explanation - the more the better.
<br><br>And reincarnation immortal realm is not a cabbage, there are only so many on this island, and now accidentally encountered a, also counted as an unexpected harvest, the future may also be able to use for the seniors.
<br><br>But right now is not familiar with Jiang to.
<br><br>More do not know how Jiang to character.
<br><br>So there is still to be examined to examine, Gong Chen this is how to deal with.
<br><br>Jiang to hold tightly to the jade slip.
<br><br>A face of surprise.
<br><br>She understood that this is Gong Chen's hope for her.
<br><br>Maybe in the future, she can really get the care of this super expert Gong Chen.
<br><br>And as long as one could live, there was a hope of going out in the future ......
