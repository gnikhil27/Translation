The others, waiting outside.
<br><br>For a long time.
<br><br>No movement was seen.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Suddenly, a pig-like scream that broke the silence of the cold night came out, followed by a white-robed figure breaking out of the window and smashing at their feet.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>The crowd looked at the unmanly white-robed figure at their feet, and voices of confusion came out.
<br><br>"Ah, it's me, ouch, it hurts!"
<br><br>The white-robed man was none other than the Fifth Longkong, and a crying voice came out of his mouth, holding his unmanly face with his mouth shivering backwards with cool air.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd immediately cast a pitying gaze at the fifth long empty.
<br><br>What in the end has happened to this ah! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"So, is it still going on?"
<br><br>At this moment, Yun Xian Que asked again cautiously.
<br><br>"Still going?"
<br><br>"To go you guys go, anyway, I am not going, oooh ......"
<br><br>Fifth Changkong held his face and cried, "This broken noodle seller is even more horrible than that pig killer just now, what the hell are all these people, and specialize in hitting faces ......"
<br><br>The people look at me and I look at you, look at each other speechless.
<br><br>Riding the night, the gray left Pingjiang City.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Master, believe me!"
<br><br>Somewhere in Pingjiang City, Shu Qinhua was holding a sound transmission jade slip and was in contact with the Demonic Sound Sect's Patriarch Xue Qinzhu.
<br><br>"Disciple, I received news about the incident in Pingjiang City, this person was able to kill Jiang Yu with a single blow, which indeed can indicate that he is a Martial Saint, or even a Martial Emperor expert, but is it not a bit too abrupt for you to promise the Heavenly Toad Silk because of that?" Xue Qinzhu asked with a slightly reproachful voice.
<br><br>"Master, it's not like that, this gentleman is definitely more than just a Martial Emperor!"
<br><br>Book Qinhua explained anxiously, "The things he created with his hands contain powerful martial intent and intent, this is simply not something that a Martial Emperor can do, and his handiwork is so big that it is through the heavens!"
<br><br>"So big that it's through the heavens?"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu questioned, "How is it so big that it's heavenly?"
<br><br>Book qin painting bit the red lips, recalling the scene seen in the martial arts museum, then said solemnly: "He made on the rice paper can be compared to the emperor's treasures, but is such a valuable thing, but he used as hand paper."
<br><br>"Hand paper?"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu frowned, did not respond.
<br><br>"Uh, to put it plainly, is, is used to wipe, wipe ...... butt." Book qin painting some difficult to start, this kind of vocabulary is also afraid that the first time from her mouth.
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>However, Xue Qinzhu laughed.
<br><br>"Disciple ah, I understand that you want to try to make friends with this expert's mood, and indeed for the sake of my magic sound clan, but the heavenly toad silk is not trivial, and the significance of my magic sound clan, I think this matter should be considered in the long run!"
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>It was obvious that Xue Qinzhu did not believe what Shu Qinhua said.
<br><br>At that, Shu Qinhua's face became anxious and he explained solemnly, "Master, I really am not lying, and I have already promised that senior, and that senior has also promised that if I send him the Heavenly Toad Silk, he will be able to make a painting at our request, believe me master!"
<br><br>"Disciple, it is not that your master is not reasonable, but the means you say is really too illusory, my master has not seen it with his own eyes, really can not believe it, moreover can not directly take out the Heavenly Toad Silk, the treasure of my Magic Sound Sect." Xue Qinzhu refused to say.
<br><br>"Master!"
<br><br>"This is a heavenly opportunity, if you miss this opportunity, you will regret it in the future!" Book Qinhua said anxiously.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The beautiful young woman Xue Qinzhu sitting on top of the mountain was silent.
<br><br>Although this thing unreal makes her very unbelievable, but she also understands his disciple's personality, also never without a goal.
<br><br>And never said such things to her like this.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she sighed and changed her attention and said, "In that case, then after a while, when I'm done with the matter at hand, I'll bring the Heavenly Toad Silk to Pingjiang City and take a trip, then we'll see if it's really as you said and make plans!
<br><br>"Master, if it is after some time, everything is too late, believe me master, this time you really have to believe me, the opportunity does not wait for people ah."
<br><br>Book qin painting at this moment anxious are about to cry out, mouth urgently said: "Although what I said is very unbelievable, but the truth is so, master you come over as fast as possible will know."
<br><br>"Alas, it's just that tomorrow I will depart!"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu sighed, there is really no way.
<br><br>At these words, Shu Qinhua was relieved and found a place to stay in Pingjiang City while waiting for Xue Qinzhu's arrival.
<br><br>Although Nansha was far away from Pingjiang City, but with Xue Qinzhu's cultivation level, he could still arrive very quickly.
<br><br>Two days later.
<br><br>When Shu Qinhua actually met this strange woman who had brought the Magic Sound Sect to glory with her own strength, Shu Qinhua was finally relieved.
<br><br>"Greetings, Master!" Book Qin Painting said respectfully.
<br><br>"How's your recovery from the damage that old bastard Jiang Yu caused you?" Seeing Shu Qinhua, his beloved disciple, Xue Qinzhu revealed a gentle smile.
<br><br>"Thank you for your concern, Master, my disciple's injury was healed that day at that senior's place." Shu Qinhua said.
<br><br>"You, you, talk about this person so miraculously, I would like to take a good look, whether it is as you said." Xue Qinzhu looked at his beloved disciple and said in a good-natured manner.
<br><br>Book qin painting lowered his head, remembered something, hurriedly asked: "Master, you heavenly toad silk belt, right?"
<br><br>"Alas disciple ah, the heavenly toad silk is my clan's important treasure, how can I bring out freely?" Xue Qinzhu shook his head and said, "First take me to meet this so-called expert, if he is really as amazing as you say, then give him the Heavenly Toad Silk, right?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Master you?"
<br><br>Book Qinhua's face changed violently and said with a face full of reproach, "I promised that senior that I would bring him the Heavenly Toad Silk as quickly as possible, yet you didn't bring it?"
<br><br>"Don't worry, it will be fine, and if you really want the Heavenly Toad Silk of the Magic Sound Sect, how can it be so easy, you have to let me see his real ability, right?" Xue Qinzhu said indifferently.
<br><br>But Shu Qinhua's face turned pale.
<br><br>Silent for a long, long time, raised his head full of solemn face and said: "Master, this matter you are very wrong, messed up, our magic sound clan will lose a heavenly opportunity!"
<br><br>"You child, how to talk to my master?"
<br><br>"If we don't give him the Heavenly Toad Silk, will he still destroy the Demonic Sound Sect? Furthermore, the Heavenly Toad Silk is a treasure that is infinitely close to the emperor's grade, what kind of chance can compare to the value of the Heavenly Toad Silk itself?"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu didn't think so at all.
<br><br>Although she understood that this one person that Shu Qinhua was talking about might be a Martial Saint or even a Martial Emperor expert, she also understood the benefits of befriending such people.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She did not think that befriending such an expert would bring benefits that could surpass the value of the Heavenly Toad Silk itself!
