Bai Piaoqiao was hairy from Yi Feng's eyes.
<br><br>The pretty face was green for a while and red for a while.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked one more time.
<br><br>"Ah ......"
<br><br>"Oh, this ......"
<br><br>"Yi Gongzi, I ......"
<br><br>"This, huh, seems to be ......"
<br><br>White floating hands and feet, mouth also stammering, half a day can also say a reason.
<br><br>"Miss Miss, I heard that Mr. Yi is back again is it?"
<br><br>Just at this time, Mao Mao's voice came from outside the door, and then walked in. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>When she saw that Yi Feng was really there, her eyes lit up and she immediately shouted excitedly, "Aiya Yi Gongzi, you're really back, that's really great."
<br><br>Looking at Mao Mao who suddenly barged in, Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes lit up.
<br><br>As if seeing a savior, she hurriedly said, "Oh, Mr. Yi, I'm really sorry, after you left, this damn girl Mao Mao slept on your bed, and this pajamas must be left by her."
<br><br>Saying that, Bai Piao Piao snatched the black pajamas and stuffed them into Mao Mao's hands.
<br><br>"Ah?"
<br><br>Looking at the pajamas suddenly stuffed in his hand, Mao Mao was startled and opened his small mouth and shouted, "Miss how can you talk nonsense, how can this be the pajamas I left behind, it's clearly ......"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before she could finish her words, the white floating jade palm landed on her lapel, and it directly threw Mao Mao away.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>"Where is Mao Mao?"
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had just inclined his head, inclined his head back again and found that Mao Mao had suddenly disappeared, and a puzzled voice came out at once.
<br><br>"Uh, huh, she has run away."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao explained with an awkward smile, "I guess he was afraid that the Duke would laugh at him and not have the face to see others."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head helplessly as his palms continued to search the bed.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The eyes lit up.
<br><br>"Found it."
<br><br>A heavy money bag was found by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Congratulations to the gentleman for losing and recovering it."
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piao Piao finally breathed a sigh of relief, if she let Yi Feng look for more, she was really afraid that Yi Feng would turn out what she had left from the bed again.
<br><br>Soon after, the two slowly came to the door.
<br><br>"Gongzi, so soon to leave?" Bai Piao Piao asked, quite a bit lost.
<br><br>"En, this time back is to find the money bag, in order to find it can delay a lot of time, so I have to continue to catch up." Yi Feng weighed the money bag in his hand and said.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao raised her head slightly.
<br><br>She also understood that no matter what, the two would always be separated again, it was just a matter of time.
<br><br>"Farewell."
<br><br>Yi Feng slowly walked towards the bottom of the mountain.
<br><br>"By the way."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao suddenly shouted.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's footsteps beat.
<br><br>"Can you give me a gift, my lord?"
<br><br>"A gift?"
<br><br>"Yes, anything!"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao looked at Yi Feng seriously and sent out a solemn voice.
<br><br>This time apart, I'm afraid it's the last time the two really met, so she hopes to leave Yi Feng the same thing.
<br><br>Perhaps when taking out such a thing many years later, one can still remember that once in this small mountain range, one once ran into such an interesting mortal.
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>"Just don't mind if you don't mind."
<br><br>Yi Feng also remembered the red beads he picked up not long ago, and casually took them out of his sleeve and handed them to Bai Piaoqiao.
<br><br>"What a beautiful bead."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao took it, loved it, played with it for a long time before putting it away and said, "I also want to give you a gift, so what you need, just ask, as long as I have!"
<br><br>"This is too polite, I do not lack anything for the time being, so thank you, Miss." Yi Feng politely refused.
<br><br>"No, you must."
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao said decisively.
<br><br>"That's, not good, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng touched his nose.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao looked at him quietly and did not move.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng helplessly shook his head, really have not seen a strong gift.
<br><br>Honestly, he really does not want anything from Bai Piao Piao, he has lived many times to disturb her, not to mention, how can also want someone else's gift?
<br><br>But see Bai Piao Piao insist look, Yi Feng also have no choice, had to think about what to ask for a gift.
<br><br>When he was worried, he happened to see the wind chimes hanging on top of the door behind Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>"Why don't you give me this wind bell?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed, this wind bell is not an expensive thing, and he can also keep it, it is perfect.
<br><br>Without waiting for Bai Piao Piao to reply, Yi Feng walked forward, plucked the wind bell off and took it into his pocket.
<br><br>"Okay, but I hope the gongzi can keep it."
<br><br>See Yi Feng as long as Yi Feng wind bell, Bai Piao Piao is not good to say anything, just with Yi Feng reminded.
<br><br>"Don't worry, girl, I will keep it well!"
<br><br>"Farewell."
<br><br>After Yi Feng smiled and clasped his fist, he slowly walked down the mountain.
<br><br>"I hope that when the future grandson sees this wind bell, he will also remember my existence, Bai Piao Piao."
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back as he left, Bai Piao Piao couldn't help but murmur.
<br><br>"Damn it, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Yun Lan sat on the haystack, filled with depression, "How come the formations we set up have failed again and again on this kid?"
<br><br>"Yes, it's really strange and evil, this kid is obviously a mortal."
<br><br>"But I just went down to the mountain and caught a small demonic beast to experiment, and the formation we set up clearly worked!"
<br><br>His subordinates also chimed in.
<br><br>The expressions on their faces were more depressed than one another.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Just now you turned off the formation?"
<br><br>Yun Lan raised his head to look outside and suddenly asked towards the subordinate just now.
<br><br>"I didn't!"
<br><br>The subordinate replied.
<br><br>Yun Lan turned her gaze to the others again.
<br><br>The rest of them also shook their heads and wagged their heads.
<br><br>"All of them didn't?"
<br><br>"Then how did the formation shut down?"
<br><br>Yun Lan couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Just after asking, a bad feeling appeared in her heart, her eyes glared, sat up on her butt and rushed towards the door.
<br><br>Other subordinates also followed.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, several people rushed to the door, coincidentally looked up toward the top of the door.
<br><br>This look didn't matter, it almost made Yun Lan's blood spurt.
<br><br>"Where's Wind Bell?"
<br><br>Yun Lan hissed loudly.
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao, who was standing and lost in thought, turned back at the sound and looked at Yun Lan, who was about to storm out, and asked softly, "Is there something wrong with Protector Yun?"
<br><br>"Miss Bai, I'm asking you, where is the wind chime that is hanging here?" Yun Lan asked with a trembling palm, staring and pointing at the top of the door.
<br><br>"Oh, it, ah, was plucked away by Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao answered softly.
<br><br>At that, Yun Lan suddenly shivered, revealing a hideous look, and said word by word: "Plucked ...... away ......?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>Yun Lan spat out a mouthful of old blood, his body aura climbed, and his hair towered at this moment.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Bastard, little thane, I wipe your ancestors, I'll kill you, draw your tendons and pick your skin!"
<br><br>Yun Lan red face, staring at the eyes about to burst out, like a wild beast, striding up and rushing towards the mountain.
<br><br>Luckily, his subordinates were quick to catch up with Yun Lan and pounced on him on the ground.
<br><br>"Don't be angry, my lord!"
<br><br>The subordinates held Yun Lan tightly and shouted.
<br><br>"Don't be angry, you're paralyzed!"
<br><br>Yun Lan waved a few people away.
<br><br>A few people rolled on the ground and pounced on Yun Lan again.
<br><br>"My lord, the big picture is important!"
<br><br>"Yes, my lord must be strong!"
<br><br>"If you really get that kid killed, I'm afraid Miss Bai will be angry, and it will inevitably affect our cooperation ah!"
<br><br>And Bai Piao Piao was also frightened by Yun Lan's appearance, and quickly came to ask worriedly, "Protector Yun, why are you doing this?"
<br><br>"Why do you think I am?"
<br><br>Yun Lan was pinned to the ground and hissed, "That son of a bitch, he destroyed my formation eye again."
<br><br>At those words, Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes jumped.
<br><br>Embarrassed, she was stunned in place.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Although I really sympathize with Protector Yun, but this time, it seems to be an accident as well ......"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao explained with an awkward smile.
