The arrogant appearance aroused the anger of all the major sects in the Middle Continent.
<br><br>Hundreds of clan experts made common cause and launched an attack towards these few uninvited guests.
<br><br>But what greeted them was a spanking from the sky from the milk dose.
<br><br>This ass down.
<br><br>Hardly the major experts in the continent pressed immobilized, all together on the ground begging for mercy.
<br><br>In a bone a dog, a centipede a black bear's might, the continent's major experts in order to avoid the crisis of extinction, only to bear the humiliation, the clan's top mounts, mountain demon beasts, all supply a few people.
<br><br>The most miserable several families, but also the old ancestors of the clan are offered.
<br><br>But the most exasperating is that the general they still can not see.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>This May in the Qing Huan phase and this combination of locusts transit, called the black May.
<br><br>Directly, in the history books of the Immortal River continent! Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Brother, brother, just such a group of garbage stuff, how to deliver ah?"
<br><br>The dog stared at the few decent demonic beasts in the storage space and said with a sad face, "This whole continent has been scoured, and there are only a few things, if this continues, you won't be able to get the three gold coins reward."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Black robe emotions fleshly visible loss.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>That is three gold coins.
<br><br>Although it's not much, but some more, at least can go to Yi Hong Yuan for a quick night.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, think of a way!"
<br><br>The centipede climbed to the shoulder of the black robe, the same can not help but shout.
<br><br>"Then it seems that this scum, can only do it to those few things, although shabby-looking, but for my three gold coins, I have no choice."
<br><br>The moment his voice fell, two rays of light shot out abruptly from the cranially hollow eye sockets.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Under the several pairs of eyes that had been hidden in the shadows during this time, observing Bonesaw and the others stirring up the continent, an incredible voice came out at the same time.
<br><br>"Actually, he found out!"
<br><br>Several voices were shocked and filled with a strong sense of incredulity.
<br><br>However, just when they hesitated to continue hiding, a voice transmission fell directly into their ears.
<br><br>"Still don't roll out, do you want this scum to directly shoot you?"
<br><br>The moment these words fell.
<br><br>It instantly stirred up their anger.
<br><br>"Your Excellency has a big mouth, the group of mole crickets outside can't do anything to you, so does that mean you can be wild in front of us?"
<br><br>"Warning you, we are not a group of trash that can be compared, it doesn't matter how you want to be on the continent, you better not affect our heads."
<br><br>The gloomy voice echoed over Bone Burner's head with a strong threat.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crossed his arms and laughed.
<br><br>"Sorry, in front of this Jagged Man, you are no different from them, you are all trash!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"What a rampant tone."
<br><br>"In that case, then we will come out to meet you."
<br><br>"I hope, your strength matches your tone."
<br><br>The voice fell.
<br><br>The glacier in the north exploded, an icy cold air, rushing up to the sky, covering towards the middle continent ......
<br><br>In the black sea, the sea water tumbled and turbulent, a black liquid broke out of the water ......
<br><br>The altar in the west, cracked open, a green breath into a star scattered ......
<br><br>South of the barren land, the sky cracked, a ten-thousand-foot-tall rock blasted up, flying out of the sky ......
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The entire immortal river continent, are inexplicably felt the terrifying pressure, countless people of low strength prostrate on the ground, face filled with thick fear.
<br><br>There are even many people, under this terrifying pressure, thought that the world was coming to an end, and their faces were filled with despair.
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>A few breaths later, four auras came at the same time, surrounding Bone Ben Wei in mid-air.
<br><br>"You, have successfully angered us."
<br><br>A gloomy voice came out, the four breaths changed hideously, and huge bodies coalesced out.
<br><br>In the north, it was a white white beast, which was bubbling with icy coldness, and when it raised its hands, space was directly frozen.
<br><br>South, a lava beast with flames, scarlet eyes flashing with fury.
<br><br>West, is a long body six feet, but with a human face of the giant bird, wings stirring at the same time, the space from time to time to tear open.
<br><br>To the south, a black water qilin diffused in the mist, is exhaling a thick breath, deadly stare at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Under the terrifying pressure of the four demonic beasts, the entire Central Continent had changed.
<br><br>The faces of the many experts in the Central Continent proper changed greatly, completely unaware of what was happening.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What they didn't expect was that in the face of their intimidating pressure, Skeleton Ben Wei and that dog were chatting to themselves.
<br><br>"Congratulations brother, congratulations brother, three gold coins have been settled." The dog congratulated excitedly.
<br><br>"Calm down, it's only four slightly larger reptiles, the master does not look at it, it is another story."
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei pressed his palm and said rather carelessly.
<br><br>"What a big mouth."
<br><br>"If that's the case, then go to hell!"
<br><br>The four great demonic beasts had an ardent killing intent.
<br><br>As they raised their hands, space tore apart.
<br><br>Almost at the same time, the aura of various elements pervaded towards Bone Ben Wei and the others from all directions.
<br><br>Under the diffusion of various terrifying elements such as ice layer and flame, space was ravaged unlike any other, tearing open a terrifying spatial crack and rippling layers of ripples.
<br><br>"Rubbish."
<br><br>Skeleton Benevolence, however, glanced at them indifferently.
<br><br>Raising his hand.
<br><br>A slap covered over.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Fearful voices came out from the mouths of the four beasts, their eyes widened at the same time, and the power they exerted instantly turned into nothingness, while they were also suppressed at the same time.
<br><br>Several thousand feet of body, in a moment became half a foot in size.
<br><br>At this time, within a blood-colored space.
<br><br>A man with a silver mask on his face knelt in it.
<br><br>"Enlightened Lord Perdition, the young generation of the North Sea has been killed almost, and some of these unawakened reincarnates should have been directly strangled."
<br><br>"However, there was also a little accident."
<br><br>Without waiting for a reply, the masked man added: "Those puppets we sent out were also exterminated, I'm afraid that there is still someone behind the scenes who is sabotaging Lord's plan."
<br><br>Long long long long.
<br><br>The blood-colored space, and no echoes came out.
<br><br>The masked man bowed his head and pondered, knowing that that person was not taking these things to heart.
<br><br>"By the way, there is one more thing."
<br><br>The man kneeled down again to report.
<br><br>"The continent recently appeared several people led by a black-robed skeleton man, they not only seized the major sects' Zhenshan secret books and Dao collection books, but also took away some of the sects' top demonic beasts, I suspect that all those other figures hiding in the shadows, also made their moves."
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>The masked man waited for a long time, and in the blood-colored space, finally came out a voice that made it impossible to hear whether it was male or female, and exactly from which direction it came.
<br><br>"I got it."
<br><br>"That black-robed material is also a small role, what they grabbed is only the things of this era, maybe some of them will affect the big picture, but it's not harmful."
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Perdition."
<br><br>The masked man breathed a sigh of relief and asked again respectfully, "Then, my lord, should we make a move?"
<br><br>"En, there are a few guys who can be used for me temporarily, it just so happens that I need some help for the next thing, so let's control them first." The voice came and said.
<br><br>"Is it Nian, Desolate them?"
<br><br>The masked man asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"En." In the blood-red chaos, a faint voice came out, "I'll give you directions, you go find them."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, a flash of surprise came out of his mouth.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Rather underestimated the skeleton man you just said."
<br><br>"However, I'm afraid that if you want to take food from my mouth, you're still a bit too young."
<br><br>The words fell.
<br><br>A blood-red palm suddenly stretched out from the blood-red space, and grasped through the endless space towards the far side.
