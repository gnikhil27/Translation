But yet.
<br><br>What neither of them expected was that in the face of this powerful sword, the black-robed man did not even return to his body, but merely lifted his right palm.
<br><br>That black robe, revealing a white-flowered finger bones.
<br><br>A light flick.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>The finger bone landed on the sword, and the longsword in Luo Lao's hand emitted a pleasant sword chirping sound.
<br><br>Then it steeply shook to pieces.
<br><br>That was not all, after shaking the longsword into pieces, the power of the finger flick did not dissipate either, but spread to Luo Lao's hand, causing his entire palm to explode.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It gave the two people the creeps. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Intense fear climbed up from the bottom of their hearts.
<br><br>Luo Lao's strength of the Star Immortal realm, coupled with the full strength of a mid-level immortal weapon, was actually broken with a snap of his fingers.
<br><br>Even the intermediate level immortal weapon, directly popped into pieces?
<br><br>This kind of power, simply subverted the two people's perception.
<br><br>"Gongzi, run!"
<br><br>Luo Lao spoke out in fear.
<br><br>He instantly knew that he could not be a match for this black-robed man, not caring about his body that was reeling from the destruction of his immortal weapon, he came to the youth's side with an arrow step and picked him up with one hand.
<br><br>The youth who was held in Luo Lao's arms, with his only remaining palm, also pulled his own desperate treasure.
<br><br>The Golden Wheel of Teleportation.
<br><br>There was a flash of golden light.
<br><br>The two people disappeared in place.
<br><br>In an instant, the two people passed through the golden wheel of teleportation and traversed through the spatial channel at a rapid speed.
<br><br>"Gongzi, what should we do, this place is too far from the Heaven's Immortal Hall, it is impossible to teleport back."
<br><br>"And if we teleport to another place, with the means of this black-robed man, he will definitely be able to follow the scent and chase us over!"
<br><br>Luo Lao shouted anxiously.
<br><br>There was also a strong flash of hatred in his eyes.
<br><br>What is their identity.
<br><br>It was the people of the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>Even if he put aside his status, as an expert of the Star Immortal Realm, he could not lose in the entire Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Never thought that one day he would suffer such a loss and be hunted down to such an extent.
<br><br>"Go to the Gathering Treasure Pavilion, the Gathering Treasure Pavilion headquarters is not far from here, and the Gathering Treasure Pavilion is also backed by the Heaven's Immortal Hall, sitting in front of countless old monsters."
<br><br>"And it is forbidden to make a move in the Gathering Treasure Pavilion, as long as we enter the Gathering Treasure Pavilion, if he dares to come after us again, then the old monsters sitting in the Gathering Treasure Pavilion headquarters will step in to help us stop him!"
<br><br>The youth shouted with an anxious face.
<br><br>"Gathering Treasure Pavilion ......"
<br><br>This made Luo Lao also instantly saw hope.
<br><br>The one behind the Pavilion of Gathering Treasures was one of the giants of the Heaven's Immortal Hall, who dared to spill the beans there?
<br><br>The two of them turned around in the spatial channel and rushed directly towards the Gathering Treasure Pavilion headquarters.
<br><br>In the room.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei stood quietly, his face expressionless.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>He stepped on his feet.
<br><br>He actually walked directly into the space.
<br><br>In the next instant, he arrived at the entrance of the Gathering Treasure Pavilion headquarters.
<br><br>When Bone Ben Wei arrived at the entrance of the Treasure Pavilion headquarters, the youth and Luo Lao had just rushed into the Treasure Pavilion, and when they saw Bone Ben Wei coming so quickly, they broke out in a cold sweat.
<br><br>"Grandpa Zhuge, save me, save me quickly!"
<br><br>"I'm Wu Fan's son Wu Sign, save me, there's a black-robed man outside who wants to kill me!"
<br><br>Entering the Treasure Gathering Pavilion, the youth hurriedly hissed and shouted.
<br><br>"Wu Fan's son?"
<br><br>Just as the youth's voice fell, an old man suddenly appeared in front of the two.
<br><br>"Greetings to old Mr. Zhuge Fu."
<br><br>The two men saw this and hurriedly paid their respects.
<br><br>With this one out, they were completely relieved.
<br><br>Wolong Fu looked at the two men and frowned slightly.
<br><br>"What exactly have you guys offended that even the Star Immortal Realm can't stop you?"
<br><br>Wolong Fu couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Grandpa Wolong, this person is after me because he saw the treasures on me!" Wu Sign knelt on the ground and shouted viciously, "Please save my life for the sake of my father, Grandpa Wolong!"
<br><br>"Look at the treasures on you?"
<br><br>Wolong Fu's eyebrows twitched.
<br><br>Wanting to say something, he didn't say anything after all, but waved his hand and said, "It's just that, I don't care what your reason is, you are Wu Fan's son after all, so stay here for now, without my consent, no one has dared to break into the Treasure Gathering Pavilion yet."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Wu Sign's face instantly showed joy, and he hurriedly paid a grateful obeisance.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the Gathering Treasure Pavilion in front of him indifferently, lifted his step, and walked in towards the front.
<br><br>Seeing the situation.
<br><br>Wolong Fu frowned.
<br><br>A wave of the palm of his hand.
<br><br>Eight old men appeared out of thin air and came to the gate, stopping in front of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>And the eight old men, without exception, were actually experts of the Star Immortal Realm.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, please stand still."
<br><br>A warning voice came from one of the old men.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei did not say a word and continued to advance.
<br><br>The eight men's faces sank as they glanced at each other and moved in an instant.
<br><br>With a flip of the hand, eight thick palm imprints were slapped towards Bone Ben Wei in unison.
<br><br>But what one did not expect was that just as the eight palm prints touched the black robe, they were shaken away by a strong and unparalleled force.
<br><br>"Boom boom boom boom ......"
<br><br>The eight people flew backwards.
<br><br>Pushing down countless buildings, each face shriveled and planted on the ground, spitting out blood.
<br><br>And Skeleton Ben Wei, from the beginning to the end, did not raise his head.
<br><br>Footsteps.
<br><br>Still walking as plainly as ever.
<br><br>"How dare you!"
<br><br>When Wolong Fu saw this, there was a fine light flickering out of his cloudy gaze, and with a single step of his feet, he actually shrunk to a foot, and instantly reached the entrance.
<br><br>"This black robe actually dared to make a move in the Gathering Treasure Pavilion, drawing Elder Wolong Foo to take action himself, he's dead!"
<br><br>Seeing Wolong Foo take action himself, Wu Sign and Luo Lao's eyes were glowing with essence, and they looked at the entrance with a vicious face, full of expectation.
<br><br>"Your Excellency, I admit that you are very strong!"
<br><br>"But this is the territory of my Gathering Treasure Pavilion."
<br><br>"I still hope that Your Excellency can sell me face, as long as Your Excellency turns around and leaves, I promise that I will not be blamed for what just happened."
<br><br>Wolong Fu looked at Bone Ben Wei in front of him and sent out a warning voice.
<br><br>Hearing the sound.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's black robe moved gently.
<br><br>The pupils behind the mists looked at him.
<br><br>"You, what are you?"
<br><br>"And worthy of asking this god to sell you a face?"
<br><br>"Kneel down for me!"
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, the legs of Wolfram Foo in front of him landed on the ground with a bang.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei swept past him and continued to walk by step by step.
<br><br>While kneeling on the ground, Wolong Fu was covered in cold sweat, staring at his eyes, his soul almost flew away, even his soul felt like trembling.
<br><br>Mouth shivering, actually can not say a word.
<br><br>There is no longer the previous breeze.
<br><br>He clearly remembered that moment just now, it seems that the heavenly dao gave him a decree, so that he did not dare to resist.
<br><br>If he does not kneel.
<br><br>Will be the soul to fly away.
<br><br>The two Wu signers who were expecting that Wolong Foo would clean up Bone Ben Wei, saw Wolong Foo kneeling directly under the word of Bone Ben Wei, and goose bumps grew on the two of them.
<br><br>"How ......"
<br><br>"How can ......"
<br><br>"Wolong senior, how can kneel ......"
