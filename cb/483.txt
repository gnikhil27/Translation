The sudden appearance of several people immediately attracted everyone's attention.
<br><br>Whether it was Liu Ruyan or the crowd of Tianxing City, or Xiao Zhan's father, Xiao Yun, were no exception.
<br><br>What kind of person, so daring.
<br><br>How dare he talk to Ruyan Liu like this?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Facing the gazes of the crowd.
<br><br>The head of the Su Yun Yun face does not change color, head held high, the confident aura pervades the scene, as if born to be a king.
<br><br>Liu Ruyan tightly frowned.
<br><br>Because she felt a great threat in Su Yunyun's body, and even her appearance, covered their original light, so that should be dazzling her, become dull.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Su Yunyun behind other people, but also to attract her attention. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The man holding a long sword, a righteous face, that awe-inspiring and righteous appearance is like a righteous light.
<br><br>In addition the man who was covered in ties, raising the corners of his mouth without the slightest concern for anything sweeping the whole room, even more so, he felt a hint of danger ......
<br><br>"Who are you people?"
<br><br>Finally, Liu Ruyan asked out in a low voice.
<br><br>"We are Xiao Zhan's senior brothers and sisters." Su Yunyun said indifferently.
<br><br>When Su Yun Yun's words fell, there was an uproar in the room.
<br><br>Including Xiao Zhan's father, Xiao Yun, was also filled with confusion.
<br><br>This Xiao Zhan had been a waste since he was young and had never joined the sect at all, so where did such a group of senior brothers and sisters suddenly appear?
<br><br>"Talking so wildly, I would have thought it was someone."
<br><br>And Liu Ruyan knew the answer, but suddenly relaxed, raised the corners of his mouth snickered, said carelessly: "actually just his senior brothers and sisters!"
<br><br>The contempt in Liu Ruyan's eyes was undisguised.
<br><br>What was Xiao Zhan like, she was still not clear?
<br><br>What kind of big clan was the clan that could let Xiao Zhan join?
<br><br>Plus she just measured Su Yun Yun a few people, except for some vaguely extraordinary, simply did not notice how strong their cultivation was.
<br><br>Since this is the case, these people are probably what identity strength, call out the ......
<br><br>"Your mouth is wild, for the sake of the Xiao family, I do not see eye to eye with you."
<br><br>"But the three days you just said, are you sure?"
<br><br>Liu Ruyan raised the corner of her mouth and asked.
<br><br>Three days to challenge her, she only took it as a joke.
<br><br>However, if she could compress the three years to three days, she would be able to settle this matter earlier, so why not.
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Su Yunyun nodded her head lightly.
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan raised the corners of her mouth, then inclined her head and turned her gaze towards Xiao Zhan at the side.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan's face showed a struggle.
<br><br>After gritting his teeth and considering for a moment, he finally nodded solemnly towards Ruyun Liu.
<br><br>"Are you really sure?"
<br><br>"But don't back out then and say that I, Ruyan Liu, forced you and didn't give you time or give your Xiao family a chance." Liu Ruyan raised her chin and asked.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan was just about to speak when Xiao Yun hastily pulled Xiao Zhan and opened his mouth to ask: "Zhan'er you, are you sure you really want to?"
<br><br>"Father, they are indeed my master brothers, I am willing to believe them."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan explained softly on the side, while telling Xiao Yun about the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>"Father, although I have never seen their skills, but I have a vague feeling that they are extraordinary, and that flyer from that day ......"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan again detailed about the magical flyer.
<br><br>"So no matter what, they can come here to help me, I'm already grateful, even if it really doesn't work, three years and three days, what's the difference?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Xiao Yun did not know what to say.
<br><br>In his heart, he sighed, only hoping that these few brothers and sisters, can really be as Xiao Zhan felt, have extraordinary means.
<br><br>"I'm sure."
<br><br>"Just three days, after three days, see you at the Heavenly Spirit Sect, if I can't beat you, then the marriage contract will be cancelled on the spot!"
<br><br>Xiao Zhan raised his head firmly to look at Liu Ruyan and transmitted his voice.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan had just made sure, but there was a roaring laughter from the side.
<br><br>"Xiao Zhan ah Xiao Zhan, what are you, actually dare to really make a wild statement and challenge Miss Liu Ruyan for three days?"
<br><br>"What kind of sister of yours is obviously a pit, you actually really listen to the delusional words."
<br><br>"That's it, originally you could still keep your face for three more years, now ah, soon to become a laughing stock for others."
<br><br>"You guys don't say that, three years or three days, in fact, the result is the same, I guess he also figured it out and didn't want to struggle."
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>The jeers continued, extremely harsh.
<br><br>But Xiao Zhan still held his gaze firmly, confirming the three-day period.
<br><br>Even though he had joined the Heaven and Earth Sect not long ago, and even joining was inexplicable, but the day he got that flyer and came to the Heaven and Earth Sect, he had a vague feeling that the turning point of his life, was in the Heaven and Earth Sect!
<br><br>And his brothers and sisters, usually can not see half strength, but Xiao Zhan also always felt that they are not ordinary people.
<br><br>And in the Heaven and Earth Gate, he felt an unprecedented warmth, where no one ever scorned and mocked him for being a waste, instead all the brothers and sisters cared for him.
<br><br>Even this time he came back, the master still sent his senior brothers and sisters to support him.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan was willing to trust them.
<br><br>Even if after three days there was still no suspense and defeat.
<br><br>He did not regret it either.
<br><br>"Very well, this three-day period will be set, and I hope that all of you present will help me as a witness."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan said indifferently.
<br><br>"Don't worry Miss Liu Ruyan, we are all witnesses, it was Xiao Zhan who made the wild claim that he wanted to turn three years into three days, not Miss Liu Ruyan's coercion."
<br><br>"Right, right, today Miss Liu Ruyan is benevolent to the Xiao family, only they do not appreciate it."
<br><br>"After three days, he lost at Miss Ruyan Liu's hands, and it was his own fault for being withdrawn from the marriage."
<br><br>"Thank you all so much."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan raised her head with a faint smile, glanced at Su Yun Yun Yun and Xiao Zhan a few people, and then led the old man away.
<br><br>Subsequently, the crowd from the Heavenly Star City, also left with mockery.
<br><br>After they left, the news that the waste of the Xiao Family, Xiao Zhan, was going to challenge Liu Ruyan in three days spread throughout Tianxing City, and then spread to the rest of the world as if it had grown wings.
<br><br>Within a short time, the entire Southern Domain had gotten the news.
<br><br>It had become the laughing stock of the people.
<br><br>And such a good show, love to watch the crowd obviously do not want to let go, a large number of people rushed towards the Sky Spirit Sect, looking forward to the good show in three days.
<br><br>Xiao family.
<br><br>"Fifth senior sister, these few trash why do you talk so much to them, just let me just tear them apart?" Hong Crazy asked with a face full of depression.
<br><br>"This is, after all, senior brother's matter, he needs to solve it personally." Su Yunyun said in a soft voice.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>If this kind of matter was not solved by Xiao Zhan himself, it would inevitably create a knot in his heart and have an impact on his future cultivation.
<br><br>"Then wouldn't there be no more fights?" Hong Crazy asked again.
<br><br>"Not necessarily, it depends on whether they are willing to fulfill their promise after three days and let that Liu Ruyan be a cow for senior brother." Su Yun Yun said, "If they are not willing, you can then exterminate the Heavenly Spirit Sect!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Hearing that the entire sect can be exterminated, Hong crazy eyes lit up, flashing with expectation, and added: "Had I known that, then senior sister you get what three days, three quarters of an hour is not enough, I can't wait?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun couldn't help but give him a white look.
<br><br>"This three days time, I am not reserved for senior brother Xiao Zhan, it is reserved for senior brother Bai Qi Yu." Su Yun Yun said breathlessly, "Senior Brother Bai Qi Yu can't fly since he became bald."
<br><br>"Uh, yes oh!"
<br><br>Hong Crazy nodded dumbly.
<br><br>Only now did he remember that they had been here for so long, and his tenth senior brother Bai Qiyu was still running halfway, even if he turned around and ran to the Heavenly Spirit Sect now, it would still really take three days.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Hearing the conversation of these few brothers, Xiao Yun on the side frowned with a complicated face.
<br><br>Although he was willing to believe in his son's idea before, expecting that these few people really had strength and cards, and might really think of some way to make something change after three days.
<br><br>But now, the more he heard, the more wrong it was.
<br><br>And three fucking quarters of an hour, this is not bullshit?
<br><br>So, he hastily pulled his son Xiao Zhan to the side.
<br><br>"War son, these senior brothers and sisters of yours, are they sure they are not liars?"
<br><br>"When they were talking, why did I feel like the cows were flying in the sky?"
<br><br>Xiao Yun asked with a worried face.
