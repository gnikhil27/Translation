"Do you remember that the founding ancestor predicted that my Heavenly Sword Sect was in danger of extinction and was unable to break the game for a long time." Ye Tian Sheng asked.
<br><br>"Remember."
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng nodded his head.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng then said, "Then do you think this crisis of extinction of our Heavenly Sword Sect has been broken now?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng's eyes stared in surprise and said, "What do you mean?"
<br><br>"Good, the deadly situation of my Heavenly Sword Sect has been broken!"
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng stroked his beard and smiled, "And this is where that gentleman is most profoundly righteous."
<br><br>"Its style, when called the saint of the world, also has a heart higher than the sky."
<br><br>"Because Peng Xian'er so unenlightened situation, he did not drive to the end, only destroyed my Heavenly Sword Sect mountain gate as a slight lesson, and even he used this lesson to solve the deadly situation of my Heavenly Sword Sect, in addition to giving me some opportunities!"
<br><br>"So what is this if not a saint of the day?" Ye Tian Sheng asked rhetorically.
<br><br>At these words, Duan Qingfeng suddenly realized. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The truth is indeed as Ye Tian Sheng said, although the foundation of his Heavenly Sword Sect was destroyed, but the sect's personnel did not break, and also solved the deadly situation that could not be broken for ten thousand years.
<br><br>The original he has been in the destruction of the mountain gate in the sadness can not come out, this moment is considered the gloom is dispersed.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng said with a face of admiration: "So now when I think of Mr. pushing away that dead game, he said to me what is the point of keeping a dead game, rather than a new game, I understand the real meaning!
<br><br>"So he was reminding me that the Heavenly Sword Sect should be given a new lease of life!"
<br><br>"Fortunately, I did not act rashly at that time, otherwise I would have walked into the abyss of eternal destruction!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng also lamented incessantly.
<br><br>Originally thought that this time is his Heavenly Sword Sect's great calamity, but in fact is his Heavenly Sword Sect's blessing and new life ah!
<br><br>"By the way, old ancestor, forgive my ignorance, but what about that tie?"
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng couldn't help but ask again.
<br><br>At that, Ye Tian Sheng sighed and said solemnly, "This should be considered as that one's final warning!"
<br><br>"Because he could easily win against me, but ended up with a draw, which is the same as telling us that he can have countless ways to destroy our Heavenly Sword Sect, but is willing to leave us a way out, which is to tell us to behave ourselves after letting us live!"
<br><br>"Therefore, we must not fail our senior's righteous deeds, and at the same time, we must reorganize the sect to stop things like Peng Xian'er from happening again!"
<br><br>"In addition, when rebuilding the mountain gate, then the original form of Mr. build a saint statue for people to worship, anyone approaching the Heavenly Sword Sect, must perform three kowtow,."
<br><br>"As ordered."
<br><br>Duan Qingfeng nodded solemnly, and his gaze was also full of gratitude to that One.
<br><br>Because this one, indeed, is a saint for, to his Heavenly Sword Sect has a rebuilding grace, deserves all this.
<br><br>And in his heart, he also felt deep remorse for his previous resentment against Yi Feng.
<br><br>Looking at the direction of Yi Feng's departure, he bowed deeply.
<br><br>Two days later.
<br><br>Since the Heavenly Sword Sect was not far from Mei Xian City, Yi Feng had already returned to Mei Xian City and gathered with Old Man Wang's group of people.
<br><br>After resting for a day, Yi Feng was ready to take the group to continue on his journey. After all, he still had his disciple's wedding in mind.
<br><br>Yang Tianyu and other people were bidding farewell to Yi Feng, their faces showing their reluctance to leave.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, thank you all for this time, but I still have important things to do, so I'll say goodbye for now." Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>"Now take your time and send off senior with respect."
<br><br>The people said respectfully.
<br><br>"By the way, how can I contact you guys in the future." Yi Feng remembered something and asked again.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd turned excited.
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng was able to say such words as often contact, obviously has approved of them ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, the crowd took out a transmission jade slip and said, "Sir, through this you can contact us at any time."
<br><br>Looking at the jade slip in his hand, Yi Feng was quite surprised.
<br><br>This thing he knew what it was, and the previous world's telephone is similar, but can afford to use such things, in addition to cultivators is the kind of rich tycoons.
<br><br>The pursuit of art, really are rich people ah.
<br><br>After putting away the jade slip to say goodbye, Yi Feng and his party rushed all the way towards the lower river.
<br><br>After half a month of trekking, finally arrived at the destination, Hanchang City, Lower River, Yun family.
<br><br>On the five main doors, red silk knotted with large flowers, the eaves on both sides of the house hung with large red lanterns, red silk around the entire courtyard wall, a festive atmosphere.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood outside the gate with his sleeves together, thinking about the news he had just heard, a sad face.
<br><br>Yun family to marry a daughter, just tomorrow.
<br><br>The bride, it is his precious apprentice's first love, Yun Mengtian.
<br><br>As soon as he heard the news, Zhong Qing's eyes turned red, clenched his fist tightly and became half-hearted.
<br><br>"Apprentice, it's okay, there is a master."
<br><br>Yi Feng comforted him and went straight to visit the Yun family.
<br><br>After some twists and turns, Yi Feng finally brought Zhong Qing is to the Yun family living room.
<br><br>The top.
<br><br>There was a middle-aged man drinking tea, it was the Yun family's family head, Yun Sheng, who was also Yun Mengtian's father.
<br><br>Suddenly, he put down his cup of tea, glanced at Yi Feng and Zhong Qing indifferently, and asked, "You guys are from Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and nodded his head.
<br><br>"My Yun family doesn't seem to have anything to do with your Excellency, so please explain your purpose for coming this far!" Yun Sheng asked directly.
<br><br>Yi Feng touched his nose, and after a little bit of pleasantries, he also directly explained where he came from.
<br><br>After saying that, the master and disciple stared closely at Yun Sheng.
<br><br>Especially Zhong Qing was filled with tension.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>But Yun Sheng laughed out loud and looked at Yi Fengdi and asked, "Your Excellency is not joking, can't you see that my daughter is getting married tomorrow?"
<br><br>"I know, so that's exactly why I'm so anxious." Yi Feng explained, "But my disciple and your daughter do like each other, and I hope that the Yun family head will comply with the wishes of his descendant."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, what a good line about the wishes of the descendant."
<br><br>Yun Sheng laughed mockingly, turned his gaze subconsciously to Zhong Qing next to him and asked, "Let me ask you, you said that your disciple wants to marry my daughter, what are you able to produce, or rather, what qualifications does your disciple have?"
<br><br>"To be honest, I am properly prepared for this visit." Yi Feng said, "I have 500,000 gold coins here, which is my bride price for the Yun Family Master."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, five hundred thousand gold coins." Yun Sheng laughed: "What do you really take my Yun family for, half a million gold coins to marry my daughter, you are a bit too whimsical."
<br><br>"Isn't that enough ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>This is really considered his entire family's money.
<br><br>"Forget it, I won't make things difficult for you guys, hurry up and go!"
<br><br>Yun Sheng waved his hand and got up, "And I'm not afraid to tell you that the person my daughter is going to marry is the young male of the Ye family, Ye Wuchen, perhaps Ye Wuchen himself is not much outstanding, but his Ye family is the first family of my Hanchang City, Ye Wuchen's elder brother Ye Tianzhi is even the junior captain of the outer gate of the Blowsnow Villa."
<br><br>"So, even if I promise you, the Ye family is unlikely to agree, so you'd better give up this idea, lest you get into trouble."
<br><br>After saying that, he gave a wink to the two subordinates next to him.
<br><br>"Go go go."
<br><br>Seeing this, the two subordinates hurriedly pushed Yi Feng and his master and disciple out towards the door.
