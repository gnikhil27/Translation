The first thing you can do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng said this in a serious manner, Peng Xian'er killing intent straight up.
<br><br>She stopped Yi Feng is obviously looking for trouble, the ridiculous is this mortal actually so self-serving.
<br><br>How could she think that she, the proud daughter of the Heavenly Sword Sect, would look for him, a mortal, to get back together?
<br><br>Inevitably, her murderous gaze forced Yi Feng directly, and her mouth drank word by word: "Yi Feng you punk, who wants to get back together with you, do you not see the current situation?"
<br><br>"Oh, not looking for me to get back together, that's great."
<br><br>Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief and patted his chest as if relieved, "Then since you are not looking for me to get back together, then I will leave first."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng brushed past her.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was petrified in the same place.
<br><br>Reacting to the violent heaving of her chest, her body trembled.
<br><br>This mortal. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Good ......
<br><br>So angry ah!
<br><br>Without saying a word, the long sword in her hand was drawn, her eyes flashed with a compelling killing intent, pointing straight toward Yi Feng's back.
<br><br>"Stop Holy Maiden!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Chang Jiankong's body flashed and hastily stopped Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Elder, what are you doing, let me kill this damned gnat." Peng Xian'er said with a face full of killing intent.
<br><br>"A mere mortal, any random person can kill him, but have you forgotten what kind of place this is?" Long Jiankong hastily reminded, "That reclusive supreme master lives nearby, if you make a move against him here, in case you cause that one's displeasure, the loss will not be worth the gain ......"
<br><br>At those words, Peng Xian'er's gaze twitched.
<br><br>Long Jiankong said is not without reason, a Yi Feng, she has a million ways to torture him, but if you do not intend to offend that one, then not to mention the opportunity, I'm afraid to get out of the problem.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she clenched her red lips and put away the long sword, full of reluctance to watch Yi Feng leave.
<br><br>Only intend to find the next opportunity to deal with Yi Feng.
<br><br>The Yi Feng, on the other hand, did not put this bitch in mind.
<br><br>The previous is a childhood friend is not false, but that is already in the past tense, in the blink of an eye into the pork rong home, and the old Wang head a few big mouth to eat up.
<br><br>And Peng Xian'er two people are continuing to look for clues in the vicinity.
<br><br>Because can kill Jiang Yu, at least is also the existence of the Martial Emperor, can get the opportunity to put aside, but any can befriend some, to her Heavenly Sword Sect also has endless benefits.
<br><br>"Qing ah, seems to get money is not as easy as imagined ah!" On a certain step, Bones Ben Wei sat despondently and spat at the dog on the side.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>The dog son heaved a sigh, but looking at the skeleton Ben Wei this downward appearance, he did not give up and said: "Brother you wait, not far from the wasteland there is a grave, I go pick see."
<br><br>Saying that, the dog hurriedly ran away.
<br><br>"Well, remember to keep me informed when you have good news ah Qing!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei looked at the dog's departing figure and continued to sit on the steps and shouted.
<br><br>"There doesn't seem to be any clear clues found."
<br><br>Peng Xian'er two people came, a side of the long sword air frowned and said.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er also frowned.
<br><br>"However, since it is a hidden high person, the usual behavior and demeanor will always be different from ordinary people, it seems that we need to find someone nearby to ask, maybe we can find some clues." Long Jiankong said again.
<br><br>"Well!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er nodded in agreement.
<br><br>Just a few steps away, the two saw a black-robed man sitting on the steps not far away.
<br><br>The two looked at each other and walked over and came behind the black-robed man.
<br><br>Eyes looking down at the black-robed man at his feet, Long Jiankong asked in a deep voice: "Hey, mortal, get up and answer me a few questions."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei, who was squatting on the steps and playing with the centipede, just ignored it and continued to play with the centipede in his hand.
<br><br>The two people's eyebrows suddenly frowned.
<br><br>Especially Peng Xian'er, just now in the hands of Yi Feng ate a turtle and forget it, did not think that a silly-looking mortal, also did not put her in the eyes.
<br><br>"Are you looking for death?"
<br><br>With a long sword in her hand, she landed on the black-robed man's neck, accompanied by an ice-cold voice falling.
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei, who was crouched on the steps, dumbly turned his head back and turned his gaze towards the two.
<br><br>Whoosh!
<br><br>Seeing this hazy, can't see the specific face of the familiar look, just now the two people who are still condescending, suddenly chill, eyes flickering out thick fear.
<br><br>It is simply a narrow path of injustice.
<br><br>I never thought that I would run into this horrible person here again.
<br><br>At the same time, Peng Xian'er palm also seems like a touch of electricity, then the hand longsword pulled back, mouth stammering explanation: "I, I I, I that I, senior, misunderstanding, misunderstanding, sorry ......"
<br><br>Said, the two men did not say a word, pull out their legs and run.
<br><br>Ben a face down skeleton Ben Wei do not want to pay attention to the two, but remembered what, the spirit suddenly revived, shouted: "No running, give me stay!"
<br><br>Two people heard the words, the soul was almost scared out, where still dare to stay.
<br><br>Directly spit a mouthful of essence blood, burning essence blood to play the speed of this life did not have and began to run.
<br><br>"Brother, that grave hair is not."
<br><br>Also at the same time, the dog ran back from the side and reported towards skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Qing ah, you came back just in time, the grave is not important, hurry up with brother to catch the two!" Bone Ben Wei shouted.
<br><br>Hearing this, the dog also immediately understood, all the aura of the body revealed, instantly caught up with the two people, blocking in front.
<br><br>Demon daddy?
<br><br>Two people's faces changed greatly.
<br><br>There was no way to escape, and their faces were white as they shrank into the corner.
<br><br>"Hehehe."
<br><br>A bone and a dog showed an evil smile, as if looking at small prey generally looked at the two, slowly and slowly forced past.
