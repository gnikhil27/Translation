Yi Feng put the man's body to rest.
<br><br>Looked at his clothes that were torn to pieces by the vultures.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he took off his clothes and put his wolf skin on him.
<br><br>When he was ready to leave, Yi Feng suddenly saw that there was a book in the cover of his clothes.
<br><br>He was curious to go up and pick up the book.
<br><br>Heavenly Demon Body ......
<br><br>Ooh yo, the name looks awesome!
<br><br>Could this be his own chance?
<br><br>Yi Feng opened the book and the words that came to his eyes made his body shake!
<br><br>Heavenly devil body, practice this technique, can resist injury to resist the law, the great consummation for the heavenly Luo vajra body.
<br><br>Resist injury to protect the law ...... a second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up.
<br><br>This means that if you practice this gong method, who is not afraid to fight?
<br><br>This feeling is good!
<br><br>If that 1,000 qi luck point transmission goods do not pit him, then he can not be okay to go out to go around and make a mess. When you are bored, go out and find the true meaning of life.
<br><br>The first thing you can do is to go out and find the true meaning of life.
<br><br>Really dangerous, you can also return to the Shadow Island.
<br><br>The more Yi Feng thinks about it, the more he thinks it is.
<br><br>Then it is said, this dark shadow island ...... can even become their own retirement place ......
<br><br>Yi Feng stood up and seriously looked around.
<br><br>In the distance, wild sand swept through, and then far away, there are huge tornado masses, gloomy clouds, the wind over like a knife scraping.
<br><br>The environment here is really good ah.
<br><br>Yi Feng face hung a smile, no sunshine do not have to be afraid of the sun, and not afraid of rain.
<br><br>Do not have to fight for fame and fortune, do not have to compete with others to fight.
<br><br>There are not many people, a person living is not afraid.
<br><br>Moreover, even if someone is on this island, and can not use magic.
<br><br>With their own hands martial arts and God than, is the king of heaven to come also have to call themselves a brother.
<br><br>The more Yi Feng looked at the more he felt that this place is good-looking.
<br><br>This is simply the back garden of his heart to raise health ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng settled the corpse and left with the gongfu he picked up.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>Yi Feng went around Shadow Island again for a long time, trying to find something to gain Qi luck points.
<br><br>A day down also nothing to gain.
<br><br>Watching the sky getting dark, he went home.
<br><br>As soon as he entered the house, he opened the gong method and began to cultivate.
<br><br>Said to cultivate, rather than directly look.
<br><br>Yi Feng simply does not know how to cultivate. You know, he has never cultivated before.
<br><br>A body of cultivation is also given by the system.
<br><br>But he did not think so, seriously will gong method after reading, ready to follow the book said the cultivation method to start messing around.
<br><br>A serious cross-legged squint on the eyes.
<br><br>But just squinting on the eyes, it is indisputable yawn, the brain has not thought where to start, then drowsy sleep.
<br><br>The next morning, wake up Yi Feng thought of the right thing to do, practice.
<br><br>That's right, keep practicing.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat upright and was ready to continue practicing, when he suddenly saw his skin.
<br><br>Originally fair skin, but turned into bronze!
<br><br>After one night ......
<br><br>"Sizzle ......" Yi Feng sat up with a jolt, waking up in the atmosphere of ignorance all swept away.
<br><br>He raised his hands, staring left and right at ...... this ...... skin have changed a color ......
<br><br>There is no sun on this island, but it can also be sunburned like this?
<br><br>It is not accidentally eat what poisoned it ......
<br><br>But he clearly did not eat anything indiscriminately.
<br><br>Terrible things are first let slowly out to eat a few bites!
<br><br>Suddenly thought of something, Yi Feng picked up the gongfu on the bed and turned it over.
<br><br>By the way, last night he was practicing this gong method, hard until he fell asleep!
<br><br>Other than that, there is nothing else.
<br><br>Turned to the end, and really found the answer on the last page.
<br><br>The Heavenly Devil Body Technique is practiced to perfection, and the skin of the whole body is like the color of bell-covered copper.
<br><br>"Perfection??" Seeing this, Yi Feng was surprised to the extreme, "Oh mama yeah, I practiced to perfection in one night??"
<br><br>"Kung Fu does not disappoint the painstaking man ah!" Yi Feng hugged the book and laughed out loud, "It seems my efforts were not in vain! I've practiced to perfection in one night!"
<br><br>After being happy, Yi Feng couldn't help but sigh that his talent was too awesome.
<br><br>In just one night, he had cultivated this Heavenly Demon Body.
<br><br>It seems that he is no longer the punk with no cultivation talent!
<br><br>In this way, it seems that the other techniques in this Immortal Realm, with such a powerful talent like myself, must be simple to cultivate!
<br><br>In that case, once one has saved up enough qi points, one will have a bunch of things to do that will make one happy!
<br><br>For example, first go out and add a big sect, with your own overwhelming talent, it must be any good sect at your choice.
<br><br>It is not a problem to be a chief disciple, and then you can find more powerful techniques in the sect. The first practice him a thousand or eight hundred books.
<br><br>It is best to be a sect with more beautiful women, so that you can rely on your charisma while practicing the techniques, so that the nubile and good-looking sisters will have a non-existent desire for you.
<br><br>At the same time ...... this immortal world heard of the dark shadow island, but also can become their own back garden.
<br><br>When you encounter danger or something, come back to a meteoric by the way degree vacation.
<br><br>The future can be expected ah!
<br><br>Of course, all these fantasies, built on top of the reliable system.
<br><br>As long as the system does not pit him.
<br><br>No, not so pit, everything will be able to act according to the plan.
<br><br>Yi Feng thought about this and thought deeply for a while.
<br><br>Finally decided not to put all the hope on the system.
<br><br>Learn a lesson and grow wiser.
<br><br>He has eaten a lot of rift, can not not grow wise.
<br><br>So next, Yi Feng waited for enough qi luck points to be saved while he opened the life of planting fields to save food and killing wolves to save meat.
<br><br>The sun rises and sets, the day begins and ends in a leisurely hunt.
