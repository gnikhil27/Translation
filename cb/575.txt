"Look at you hungry bar a few of, want to eat feel free to take it!"
<br><br>"Come find me in the courtyard when you're done eating."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng carried the wine jug and lazily walked towards the courtyard, and then laid down on the recliner.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir!"
<br><br>Gong Chen hurriedly bowed and thanked him.
<br><br>Although as an immortal cultivator he didn't have much of an obsession with food, he had to see where it was at, and even though he could barely keep up with his strong cultivation, it would be a great joy to have a full meal.
<br><br>He quickly wolfed down his food.
<br><br>But as he took a bite.
<br><br>Instantly, his eyes widened.
<br><br>Staring dead at the neck of the vulture in his hand.
<br><br>"This ...... this this this ......" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>He was shocked to find that this vulture neck, actually contains a strong power, that bite of meat entrance, as if taking an elixir.
<br><br>Almost instantly, his internal organs, which were eroded by the brutal air, were repaired quite a bit.
<br><br>And strength also began to slowly recover.
<br><br>He was excited beyond words.
<br><br>This was not just a full meal, this was clearly an opportunity given to him by this high person in front of him.
<br><br>Hands trembling, holding the vulture neck, his eyes looked at Yi Feng in the courtyard, and his legs involuntarily knelt down.
<br><br>"Gong Chen, thanks a lot for the gift of Mr.!"
<br><br>He respectfully passed out his voice.
<br><br>The courtyard.
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously raised the corners of his mouth.
<br><br>Originally he did not want to have more contact with the people on this island, after all, those who can be imprisoned in jail are not necessarily good people.
<br><br>But since he came across it, then why not contact contact, think of a way to make the other side for him?
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Yi Feng this is to show him his own storage family, but also in front of him to show a hand to kill the vulture of this thing.
<br><br>This is to let this Gong Chen understand, he Yi Feng, in this island is very nourishing, follow him can also live in the island very nourishing.
<br><br>After expressing this message, then reward him with a bite to eat.
<br><br>And the result is not what Yi Feng expected.
<br><br>Right now, it seems that this Gong Chen has been taken by him.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He did not move his voice, but continued to lie on the recliner and pour the wine.
<br><br>When Gong Chen ate the entire vulture neck, he stopped.
<br><br>Because the power in it was too huge, it was simply not something he could bear, so the current him was propped up and had a hard time digesting it for a short time.
<br><br>"Eating propped up?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng on the side couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Senior you, you know this too?"
<br><br>Gong Chen lifted his head in shock, secretly exclaiming that his internal condition was all known by Yi Feng clearly?
<br><br>"One glance and you can see it."
<br><br>Yi Feng faintly spoke out.
<br><br>This guy is also.
<br><br>This vulture's head is not small, so big a neck gnawed clean, not hold up only strange.
<br><br>Gong Chen laughed at himself.
<br><br>A glance will be to explore their own clear, it seems that they want to hide what in front of this, is simply impossible ah!
<br><br>"Eat and sit next to a while, then pick a few grapes to refresh, help digestion."
<br><br>Yi Feng said lightly, finished continue to sip strong wine.
<br><br>For Yi Feng's words, at this moment Gong Chen is Mo dare not obey.
<br><br>Obediently sitting aside, deep pressure breath tuned up, feeling slightly more comfortable, then walked to the side of the grape rack, picked a few grapes.
<br><br>Then put them into the mouth.
<br><br>This is not to be put, even the seeds are directly swallowed, the taste did not taste out.
<br><br>And his face, is filled with a strong shock as well as gratitude.
<br><br>Because of the completely indigestible power in his body, after eating a few grapes, it spread like a stream towards the body.
<br><br>Nourish all over the body.
<br><br>"So, it turns out that the reason why senior told me to eat grapes is to help me digest the power in my body ......"
<br><br>"Senior is really with a bitter conscience!"
<br><br>"Such a great kindness, how can I repay?"
<br><br>He walked towards Yi Feng with a face full of fervor and bowed down beside the recliner.
<br><br>"Senior."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Yi Feng squinted his eyes, beat his bushel fan, and answered, "Digested?"
<br><br>"Yes senior, it has been digested."
<br><br>Gong Chen respectfully answered.
<br><br>"Sit!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his fan.
<br><br>Gong Chen hesitated for a moment and sat down squarely on the opposite side of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"You, what is your cultivation level?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked as if he was not paying attention.
<br><br>Gong Chen's eyes were raised.
<br><br>Secretly, he speculated about the meaning of Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>After all, with this one's strength, there was no such thing as not knowing his strength.
<br><br>Then why ask such a question?
<br><br>Can't help but ......
<br><br>He remembered the gong method he cultivated. This gong method was able to help him hide his true cultivation level.
<br><br>So together with his usual cautious nature, therefore the cultivation level that he revealed in front of people was not his true cultivation level.
<br><br>So that's how it is.
<br><br>So senior was testing my honesty.
<br><br>I was testing whether I would reveal my true cultivation level.
<br><br>"Enlightenment senior, I am Reincarnation Immortal Realm."
<br><br>Gong Chen respectfully stated his true cultivation level.
<br><br>"Reincarnation Mirror?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyebrows twitched slightly.
<br><br>In private, he began to wag his finger.
<br><br>Before coming to the Immortal Realm, he had done a little bit of work.
<br><br>Ordinary three realms, Human Immortal, Earth Immortal, Heaven Immortal.
<br><br>After the Heavenly Immortal, there is the Golden Immortal, the Xuan Immortal.
<br><br>Xuan Xian has nine turns, one turn, one heaven, each turn is a huge watershed.
<br><br>And after the Xuan Xian, there is the even more terrifying Reincarnation Immortal Realm, True Element Immortal Realm, Star Immortal Realm, Sun and Moon Immortal Realm ......
<br><br>Hiss.
<br><br>The thought of this, Yi Feng heart backwards a breath of cold air.
<br><br>I thought this guy topped a heavenly immortal, but did not think it was a reincarnation immortal.
<br><br>Do the math, this garbage human immortal, and he differed ...... a full twelve major realms?
<br><br>The treasure is found treasure!
