"This situation is not optimistic!"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng put his palm on Zhong Qing's forehead and frowned. It was clear that he was out of life danger, but the person just wouldn't wake up.
<br><br>"I'm afraid that only that medicine will work."
<br><br>Yi Feng thought for a moment, just want to mix this medicine still need quite a few things.
<br><br>It seems that he, himself, still have to go into the mountain to do so!
<br><br>Once he thought about it, Yi Feng revealed a look of hatred, and he didn't know how the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce had made things work.
<br><br>"Sir, without disgracing our mission, not only did we help you execute the culprit, the entire Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce was also exterminated by us."
<br><br>Just then, Yin Xiong rushed over with his men.
<br><br>When Yi Feng walked out of the doorway, he was taken aback because one of Yin Xiong's men was carrying a human head in his hand, and Mao Lin's head was listed.
<br><br>"Great!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Yi Feng was greatly pleased. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce's efficiency is really good, disciple, to avenge you.
<br><br>Just let Yi Feng is quite surprised, this Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce actually will be the entire Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce to destroy.
<br><br>Really ruthless ah!
<br><br>"Say it, what kind of payment do you want, as long as I can do it, I can satisfy you." Yi Feng said generously, Yin Xiong is so efficient, the compensation must not be less, even if he post all those shares of money, but to be able to avenge the hatred, it is worth it.
<br><br>At these words, Yin Xiong's face was overjoyed, knowing that this one gave him a little something that would give him a great opportunity.
<br><br>But the hard part is, he does not dare to ask for it!
<br><br>So he said politely: "Sir, you are too polite, this is just a handful of work, do not want to ask for payment!"
<br><br>A hand job?
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>Yi Feng can see that the two major chambers of commerce have long been in conflict, I am afraid that the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce has long wanted to destroy the Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce, this is not just to take this opportunity to do it, and incidentally help him take revenge.
<br><br>So that's how it is.
<br><br>"Really do not want to pay?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"Really don't need."
<br><br>Yin Xiong said with a complicated face, but in his heart, his heart had long been in his heart.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, after all, they are partners, this chamber of commerce also relies on him to earn a lot of money, it is reasonable not to want.
<br><br>"Right sir, the others of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, how to solve?" Yin Xiong asked again.
<br><br>"Other people?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, other people asked him why ah?
<br><br>But think about it, after all, so many lives are at stake, Yin Xiong even as the Chamber of Commerce's head can not decide, it is reasonable to ask his advice.
<br><br>In that case, there is no harm in talking about it.
<br><br>Rubbing his chin, Yi Feng said, "I think, if it is not a bad guy is not necessary to kill all, leave him a life is also a kind of merit, of course, the damned one can not run."
<br><br>Yin Xiong immediately understood, the heart can not help but admire, high people are high people, this kind of light-hearted and broad-minded, really can not be compared to ordinary people, and hastened to say: "Sir great righteousness!"
<br><br>"It's nothing."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>"Then sir, we will go to other things first?" Yin Xiong said respectfully.
<br><br>"Good, take your time, come and sit here often in the future when you have time." Yi Feng smiled and nodded his head, saying politely.
<br><br>At those words, Yin Xiong gave a jolt, revealing a strong excitement.
<br><br>"Sure sure."
<br><br>Although the gentleman didn't manage to give a reward, this one sentence was heavier than any reward!
<br><br>Because this means that this gentleman has approved of him, and in the long run, it is better than any heavenly material and treasure.
<br><br>......
<br><br>At the same time, Lu Qingshan had already led the eighteen guardians to feel the Sky Blast Gang.
<br><br>But just arrived here, his face sank.
<br><br>His Castle Peak Sect's Thirty-six Heavenly Deities, Seventy-two Earthly Demons, plus all the elders and Zhu Yun included, were actually all sealed in a large formation.
<br><br>"What's going on?" The old ancestor of Castle Peak transmitted a voice.
<br><br>"Senior Uncle, let's go, this Sky Blast Gang is not as simple as it seems." Zhu Yun was leading the crowd, resisting the pressure brought by the big formation, while transmitting a voice towards Old Ancestor Qing Shan.
<br><br>The old ancestor Qing Shan sank, and was at a loss as to what to do when a strong sense of crisis hit him.
<br><br>Then he saw a white-robed figure appearing in the sky above the formation, standing with his arms folded, his cold eyes staring deadly at the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak.
