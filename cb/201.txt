Looking at the crowd's urgent appearance, it was obvious that they were all well prepared.
<br><br>"Miss, are we really not going in?"
<br><br>Not far away, Yang Mu sullenly looked at the crowd of people sharpening their fists, his face full of reluctance and urgency.
<br><br>This treasure is right in front of him, it is really hard for him to bear.
<br><br>"Yes Miss, the organs inside the tomb has been completely triggered before, other pills and techniques aside, just the three masterless holy relics, say anything to put up a fight ah!"
<br><br>On the side, Yang Sen, who usually seldom speaks, also sent out a voice.
<br><br>"With the strength of the two of us, not to say that the three holy relics will be taken, but obtain a piece or easily, such can pick up a good opportunity for nothing why you have to be so stubborn, actually really listen to the nonsense of that person Lu Qingshan!"
<br><br>Two people's faces are full of anger, really can't figure out what evil Yun Xian Que has hit this.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que bit her red lips tightly, her face was full of tangles and hesitation.
<br><br>With the situation at hand, what Yang Mu and the two said was indeed true. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>In terms of the entire South Sand, Martial Dignity is almost the highest battle power, and with two great Martial Dignities in place, at least one of the three great holy items can be obtained.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>This tomb.
<br><br>Is it really as simple as it seems?
<br><br>Is Lu Qingshan really being alarmist?
<br><br>It definitely doesn't look like it!
<br><br>Because she could see that the solemnity in Lu Qingshan's caution, and he, as a native power, but turned a blind eye to this tomb, if not really get the exact information, definitely not so.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>No one in this world can refuse the opportunity.
<br><br>What's more, there was the lesson learned from the last time.
<br><br>"No!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que replied firmly.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>The two old men sighed heavily with a look of hatred, but there was still nothing wrong with taking Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>"Lu Qingshan, I hope things can really be as you say!"
<br><br>Looking at more and more people rushing in, Yun Xian Que looked at the ancient tomb and murmured out.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Although she was firm on the surface, it still took a lot of courage to make this decision.
<br><br>It was likewise under great pressure.
<br><br>Just at that moment, another figure swept into the air.
<br><br>It was the people from the Snow Blower Villa and the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>"People are coming quite fast!" After Fifth Longkong landed, he unfolded the feather fan in his hand and laughed leisurely.
<br><br>Behind him, in addition to the Fifth Formation, there was an additional old man that he had never seen before, who was obviously also a reinforcement sent by the Snow Blower Villa.
<br><br>"What's the use of coming fast, it's still impossible to say who the flower will fall." Under the veil, Peng Xian'er sneered.
<br><br>And beside her were also two Martial Exaltation experts, and of course Yu Wujie was also following her.
<br><br>Fifth Changkong narrowed his eyes and did not say anything, obviously a bit scornful of this first genius of the Heavenly Sword Sect that was rare to find in hundreds of years.
<br><br>However, he suddenly saw Yu Wujie.
<br><br>"Oh, this brother is the one who infiltrated the Earth Gate to open the Heavenly Gate last time?" Fifth Longkong said in surprise, "Really impressed me, not only did you open the Earth Gate, but you actually managed to escape in one piece, admirable!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"The one who opened the Earth Gate last time?"
<br><br>Hearing Fifth Longkong's words, many people looked over and looked Yu Wujie up and down.
<br><br>Even Yun Xian Que, who was not going to enter the tomb, also turned his gaze over.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The last incident had long since spread out.
<br><br>Despite the accident in the ancient tomb last time, such a feat of breaking through the earth's gate alone still made people feel admiration.
<br><br>After all, this kind of thing was not something that anyone could do.
<br><br>"Nice to meet you."
<br><br>"It's better to be known than to meet!"
<br><br>"Although this brother's strength is slightly lower, both his courage and bravery make us admire him!"
<br><br>"Brother, are you interested in joining my Tianba Sect?"
<br><br>"Brother, you can also consider my Ling Tian Clan!"
<br><br>For a while, many people greeted Yu Wujie, and while admiring voices came out, many more people threw an olive branch towards Yu Wujie.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This kind of talent is popular everywhere, perhaps the strength is a little lower, but have the ability to do ah!
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Hearing these voices, Yu Wujie was first stunned, and after reacting, he immediately became a little fluttery.
<br><br>You should know that the lowest strength of these people is Martial King, and even among the people who greeted him just now, there are also the existence of Martial Emperor and Martial Sect.
<br><br>He, Yu Wujie, had never been treated like this in his life!
<br><br>He couldn't help but smile in a springtime manner, straightened his chest and smiled: "You are all welcome, I am Yu Wujie, nice to meet you, nice to meet you!"
<br><br>"So it's Brother Yu."
<br><br>"Good day, brother Yu."
<br><br>There was another burst of blowing from the crowd.
<br><br>And at this time, the fifth long air also vocalized: "Brother Yu, my blowing snow mountain villa also welcomes talents like you!"
<br><br>"Good, talents like senior brother Yu are also needed in my Wind and Cloud Valley, if senior brother Yu is interested, he can also join my Wind and Cloud Valley directly!" At this time, Yun Xian Que also spoke up, although give up taking the treasure, but if you can bring back an expert to the door, it is also an unexpected joy.
<br><br>Hearing this, Yu Wujie's heart is even more excited, unexpectedly Wind and Cloud Valley and Snow Blowing Villa such a large sect have thrown an olive branch towards him.
<br><br>It is simply the peak of life ah!
<br><br>For a while, the whole person became more floating, the corners of his mouth were raised to the sky.
<br><br>"Humph, you guys want to pull him in, have you gone through my Heavenly Sword Sect's consent?" At this time, under Peng Xian'er's veil, an icy cold voice came out.
<br><br>The drifting Yu Wujie instantly reacted, waved his hand and laughed in a spirited manner, "Sorry everyone, I'm already Xian'er's man, sorry sorry sorry!"
<br><br>"You're welcome, brother Yu."
<br><br>"Since the Heavenly Sword Sect is one step faster, then we won't take away the beauty of others!"
<br><br>The crowd said they didn't mind, but their faces were still full of regret.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>The crowd returned their attention to the ancient tomb.
<br><br>It could be seen that there was no more movement inside the open stone door now, and the black fog and phantom that had pervaded before seemed to have dissipated long ago.
<br><br>At this moment, the crowd was surprisingly quiet.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Someone moved.
<br><br>And this one moved, and moved all.
<br><br>Numerous people swept up in the air and rushed towards the stone door.
