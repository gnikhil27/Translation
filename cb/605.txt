After Yi Feng killed nine people, he first went to a stream in the forest and washed himself finely clean.
<br><br>He hated getting his hands dirty with all this garbage.
<br><br>Since Guo Shijie didn't remember.
<br><br>Coming back and forth.
<br><br>Then this time, he would kill all the Earth Immortals of Sun Moon Peak!
<br><br>No, he would kill all the disciples of Sun Moon Peak!
<br><br>Above Earth Immortals, let Gong Chen kill them.
<br><br>As long as he met.
<br><br>No one will be left behind.
<br><br>......
<br><br>...... Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The sky in space sank.
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng was still in the middle of the forest.
<br><br>This forest was too big, and he walked for a long time without going out.
<br><br>At night ...... Yi Feng looked at the sky.
<br><br>At night, the demon beasts in the forest should be out, right?
<br><br>Sure enough, the forest appeared sparse sound.
<br><br>Night to, the hissing of demon beasts came from the forest.
<br><br>But Yi Feng was not interested.
<br><br>He was only interested in the people of Sun Moon Peak now.
<br><br>Inside this space, other disciples hunted and killed demon beasts.
<br><br>The people of Sun and Moon Peak kill demon beasts and also kill him.
<br><br>And his Yi Feng's prey, only the people of Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>Thinking about this, Yi Feng's gaze sunken. Than the night is heavy.
<br><br>The hissing and running sounds of demonic beasts came.
<br><br>At the same time, human voices also appeared.
<br><br>"Most of the animals in this Dark Witch Forest lie around by day and come out by night, now is the time to hunt."
<br><br>"But there is no shortage of powerful demonic beasts here, we have to round them up now."
<br><br>The words reached Yi Feng's ears, and he looked over.
<br><br>It was a group of people in blue clothes ......
<br><br>One, two, three ...... thirteen ......
<br><br>Yi Feng immediately stood up and called up his system.
<br><br>He swaggered over with his hands behind his back.
<br><br>"Good evening, gentlemen." He spoke with a smile and walked towards a group of people in blue, as if he had met friends he hadn't seen in years.
<br><br>The thirteen people were fully focused on trying to hunt demonic beasts, and now they saw Yi Feng who suddenly appeared.
<br><br>First, they were stunned, and then they were overjoyed.
<br><br>"It's Yi Feng!!!"
<br><br>The people were surprised.
<br><br>To the people of Sun Moon Peak, this was a prey that was ten thousand times better than a demonic beast!
<br><br>"Want to kill me?"
<br><br>"Hahahaha, it seems you know that the people of my Sun Moon Peak will kill you when they see you!" A disciple laughed.
<br><br>"What is your rank?" Yi Feng asked nicely, "Below Earth Immortal, I'm too lazy to make a move."
<br><br>"What, below Earth Immortal lazy to make a move?!" A few of them were extremely dissatisfied, "You bastard bastard look down on us!"
<br><br>"Right!" Thirteen people all spoke, "You still look down on us? Brother, get rid of him, he looks down on us Earth Immortals!"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Yi Feng took out his ears, "It seems that all thirteen are Earth Immortals."
<br><br>A finger movement, ten of them then exploded in place.
<br><br>One finger one.
<br><br>In an instant, there were only three people left standing in the same place.
<br><br>Three people were dumbfounded and slowly looked at one place.
<br><br>That mess of blood and flesh, and other Earth Immortal disciples in general.
<br><br>That was their senior brother! It was the core person who led their team to hunt demon beasts this time, it was a Golden Immortal ah ......
<br><br>"What about you three, are you all Earth Immortals too?" Yi Feng walked towards the three, moving is a finger.
<br><br>"No no, he is ......" three people have been scared incoherent, pointing to the spread of bloody flesh trembling, "senior brother he he is ......"
<br><br>"I'm fucking asking you three." Yi Feng spoke impatiently.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, we are all Earth Immortals!" Three people responded, and no longer said anything else, directly kneeled down, crying father and mother.
<br><br>"Didn't senior brother Yi just say that he wouldn't kill Earth Immortals? All three of us are Earth Immortals!!! Please forgive us, senior brother."
<br><br>Before the words were finished, Yi Feng snapped the neck of the person in front of him.
<br><br>Turned his head to look at the other two.
<br><br>The other two looked at Yi Feng in horror and backed up one after another.
<br><br>Yi Feng found that he actually liked the way these people fled in fear.
<br><br>So he put his hands behind his back and looked at the two with a smile.
<br><br>"Want to run, do you?"
<br><br>The two people nodded their heads frantically.
<br><br>"Good, I'll give you guys a chance." Yi Feng tilted his body and leaned against the tree trunk.
<br><br>"But then, you can't use your cultivation. Use both legs to run." Yi Feng said, and with a lift of his hand, one of them exploded into bloody flesh.
<br><br>The other one stared in horror and was directly scared silly.
<br><br>Began to go crazy.
<br><br>Directly forget to escape, paralyzed in place kneeling straight kowtowing, "Please spare me! Please spare me!"
<br><br>"Call a father to hear." Yi Feng looked at the last person from a high position.
<br><br>Like looking at a dying plaything.
<br><br>"Father! Father! Father! Father! Father!"
<br><br>"Hey -" Yi Feng let out a long sigh, finger raised in the shape of a gun, "I only let you scream nah."
<br><br>The words fell finger point out.
<br><br>The frightened and crazy disciple instantly exploded into bloody flesh.
<br><br>Yi Feng blew his fingertips.
<br><br>"What's the point of screaming so many times? Really disobedient." He murmured expressionlessly, not knowing whether he was speaking to himself or to the pile of dead flesh in front of him.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
<br><br>There are demon beasts in the forest.
<br><br>Where there are demon beasts, there will be people.
<br><br>There will definitely be disciples from Sun and Moon Peak coming.
<br><br>Looking at the blood splattered on his body. Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Killing people is easy.
<br><br>It is the old dirty clothes on the body.
<br><br>Every time after killing a wave, you have to clean up.
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed and walked towards the stream in the forest.
<br><br>Before he reached the stream, he heard someone talking.
<br><br>"How many demon beasts did you guys hunt today in total?" Not far away, human voices broke off.
<br><br>Someone cheerfully said, "Five, I have five demon pellets now! What about you guys?"
<br><br>"I don't have any yet."
<br><br>"Not even one for the day?"
<br><br>"So what if you get more demon pills, you can't make the top ten anyway." The voice said, "As long as we find Yi Feng, killing him will be more useful than how many demon pills."
<br><br>As soon as he heard this, Yi Feng, who was approaching, knew it was someone from Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>The people there also heard the movement, have turned their heads, and saw a figure come out of the forest.
<br><br>Fixed eyes to see, if not Yi Feng is who?
<br><br>The people were surprised.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at their surprised look. Hooked up an evil smile.
<br><br>The two waves of people just now, when they saw themselves, also had the same smile.
<br><br>"Kill him!" Someone called out, with a face full of joy!
<br><br>The words fell, and two people rushed forward.
<br><br>This prey belongs to whoever kills it first!
<br><br>Yi Feng two fingers point out, mid-air exploded two bloody flesh.
<br><br>The back of the people who want to try have stopped their hands.
<br><br>Thinking about the previous Yi Feng killed five Earth Immortals in one second.
<br><br>The other Earth Immortals did not dare to venture forward and stared at Yi Feng with vigilance.
<br><br>At this moment, a person suddenly jumped out, with two hands in front of him.
<br><br>"Everyone, don't be afraid, I'll block him for you!"
