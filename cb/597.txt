Yi Feng was carried away, only to find Guo Shijie waiting for him with a gloomy face.
<br><br>But before Guo Shijie could speak, Yi Feng was the first to speak.
<br><br>"Peak Master Guo, blood splattered on your face, time to learn some lessons?" He was carried much higher.
<br><br>At this moment, he looked at Guo Shijie from a high position with a sneer.
<br><br>Guo Shijie had just received a blow from the clan's elder, his organs were in severe pain, and his shaky body was now stubbornly barely standing still.
<br><br>He looked at Yi Feng indignantly, his gaze filled with hatred.
<br><br>Unfortunately, he couldn't make a move against Yi Feng at this moment.
<br><br>Looking at Guo Shijie's gnashing of teeth and hatred, Yi Feng was satisfied, and the smile at the corner of his mouth became even stronger.
<br><br>"If this doesn't grow on you, Peak Master Guo is more than bad, he's stupid."
<br><br>Said Yi Feng, Yi Feng laughed up, "Go, back to the peak!"
<br><br>"Ohhhhhh!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>A group of disciples carried Yi Feng excitedly shouted and left in style.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back as he was swarmed by the crowd and left, Guo Shijie was so angry that he was about to gnash his teeth.
<br><br>"Peak Master, let's ......"
<br><br>"Go back!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie said with hatred.
<br><br>Returning to Sun Moon Peak with injuries, Guo Shijie's body couldn't support itself.
<br><br>A mouthful of blood spat out and collapsed in the room.
<br><br>"Peak Master!"
<br><br>The disciples of Sun Moon Peak hurriedly helped him up.
<br><br>Guo Shijie slowly got up along with the disciple's support, shaking and wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>A ruthless look on his face!
<br><br>"I finally understand why that brat had to go to the Life and Death Stage."
<br><br>"So he was hiding his clumsiness! He had already designed to kill my Sun Moon Peak disciples!"
<br><br>"If I don't take revenge for this, I, Guo Shijie, swear I won't be a man!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie's angry voice spread throughout Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>The most intolerable thing was that he had suffered twice at the hands of Yi Feng, even though he was the head of a peak.
<br><br>"But the peak master, we have already broken six disciples in his hands ......" said the disciple beside him hesitantly.
<br><br>"So what?!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie turned his head and glared at the disciple who spoke with red eyes, "Do you want this peak master to let him go?"
<br><br>"Peak master, don't you find that kid very strange?" The disciple continued to speak, "Now it seems that he is definitely not a human immortal."
<br><br>"But even if he was an Earth Immortal, he couldn't have instantly killed five Earth Immortal Perfectionists in seconds!"
<br><br>"And it says he's hiding his clumsiness, but who knows how much he's hiding?"
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie narrowed his eyes and looked at that disciple with danger in his eyes.
<br><br>"What I mean, is that we can observe for a while first." That disciple said, "Do not rush to kill him for now, if ......"
<br><br>Before he could finish his words, Guo Shijie struck at him with a palm!
<br><br>That disciple was directly knocked out by a terrifying force!
<br><br>And then fell to the ground like a kite with a broken string, lifeless again.
<br><br>Although he had been taught a lesson by the sect elders, it was only a disciplinary action after all, not fatal. To kill a disciple was simply a breeze.
<br><br>"Anyone who persuades me not to kill Yi Feng again will end up like this." Guo Shijie face hatred does not decrease only increase.
<br><br>"This person, I must kill!"
<br><br>Seeing this change, the surrounding people are all silent, not daring to advise a word more.
<br><br>Guo Shijie took a breath and slowly said with a black face, "I know what you mean."
<br><br>"One Earth Immortal, how could he kill five Perfection Earth Immortals in seconds without any effort."
<br><br>"Only those fools at Star Peak would think he's just an Earth Immortal."
<br><br>"So."
<br><br>"He must be a Heavenly Immortal cultivator."
<br><br>"But so what if he's a Heavenly Immortal, at the top, he's only a Lower Three Immortals."
<br><br>Guo Shijie turned his head, looked around and gazed at the few disciples beside him.
<br><br>"In three days, it will be the sect disciples' trial meeting."
<br><br>"At that time, all the disciples from the three peaks will be there."
<br><br>"You three find an opportunity to get rid of Yi Feng."
<br><br>Two of them nodded their heads in response. The last one, alone, was a bit hesitant. Did not open his mouth to answer.
<br><br>"What, you don't want to?" Guo Shijie's face became even more sullen.
<br><br>"No, master commands, disciple will definitely go through the fire!" That disciple hurriedly took a stand.
<br><br>Guo Shijie smiled, his face eased a bit.
<br><br>And then continued to listen to the disciple said, "Just master, have you ever thought, if that Yi Feng is only a human immortal forget it, similar to mortals can not see the cultivation, it is reasonable."
<br><br>"But if it is a celestial immortal, also as a celestial immortal I, how can not see his cultivation in the slightest."
<br><br>"Furthermore, Master is high as a ninth-transformation Xuan Xian, can't you also see his realm?"
<br><br>That personal disciple said, a scornful look surfaced on his face, "Master doesn't think it's strange?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie smiled, also seriously thought about it.
<br><br>"Hiding clumsy is definitely hiding clumsy."
<br><br>"However, how much can he hide?"
<br><br>"If it is really a powerful person, it would not be possible to come to my Sun Moon Sect, as a junior disciple."
<br><br>"Otherwise, that expert's brain is amused!"
<br><br>The people next to him also all nodded their heads when they heard the words.
<br><br>To take a step back, if there is some kind of expert, because of being chased or other reasons and lurked as a disciple, then he certainly will not be overstated, but as low-key as possible.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's usual style ......
<br><br>Even into a one thought finger are eager to come up to the ears of others to shout out. Do not miss a single opportunity to shake their awesome.
<br><br>It is enough to prove that Yi Feng is definitely not this kind of person!
<br><br>After thinking about it, Guo Shijie looked at his own personal disciple, "You reminded me of one thing with these words."
<br><br>"There is an ancient treasure in the immortal world called the Immortal Reaching Needle."
<br><br>"This needle is used before a person cultivates, and with the method of ancient great powers, the needle is fused into the qi method and buried into the person's dantian."
<br><br>"First, it can promote cultivation enhancement, and second, it can hide cultivation."
<br><br>"People who are higher or lower than oneself can't see the cultivation level."
<br><br>The pro-disciple was surprised, "There is such a treasure? I've never heard of it before."
<br><br>"This thing has been lost for a long time, not many people in the immortal world know about it now." Guo Shijie slowly spoke, "I know, also because of family reasons."
<br><br>"Except that this thing, usually inherited by the extremely powerful great families in the distant past. After all, the great power that casts the spell for this thing has to be someone with blood ties."
<br><br>"Then if we kill Yi Feng, what if he has powerful relatives who seek revenge on us?" The Heavenly Immortal disciple next to him, who had been ordered by Guo Shijie, spoke up, with a gloomy look.
<br><br>"There might have been before, but now, do you think it's possible?"
<br><br>"If he really had a more powerful relative, he would still be reduced to coming to my Sun Moon Sect as a junior disciple?" Guo Shijie gave a white glance to the disciple who spoke.
<br><br>"But that reminds me." Guo Shijie said, deep in thought, "Powerful people may not be available, powerful things are not necessarily not available."
<br><br>"To have something like the Immortal Reaching Needle, what if there are other treasures?" Guo Shijie said, and then looked up to his personal disciple and ordered, "Go, call the three major geniuses of the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom over."
<br><br>"Right, there is also the second batch of disciples with Golden Immortal cultivation."
<br><br>"Recruit them all over to me."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The personal disciple answered and retreated.
