And after destroying the scroll, the eyes of Lu Zhengyi and Bai Shanyi and the others finally fell on Night Energy and the others.
<br><br>"The painting scroll has been destroyed, your big reliance is gone, what other backhand, hurry up and show it, otherwise there is no chance!"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi leisurely looked at the night can three people, transmitting a voice full of ice cold.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian also busy to look at the night can.
<br><br>"Night Neng, do you still have back moves, like painting ah statue or something?"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian asked nervously.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Night can sink his face, hard to see the extreme.
<br><br>A long time silence before shaking his head at Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian squirmed his lips, a trace of reluctance passed over his face, and did not speak. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Since there is no more backhand, hurry up and inform the one behind you to come to your death, don't be a shrinking turtle." Lu Zhengyi said with a cold face, "This will also save me from going to him personally."
<br><br>"Hmph, don't be too happy."
<br><br>Even in this situation, Night Energy did not give in, but raised his head and said with a firm face, "We do not have the means to deal with you, but it does not mean that sir does not have a backhand."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, good sir."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi laughed coldly, "If the gentleman you are talking about is really that powerful, why would he be a shrinking turtle behind his back?"
<br><br>"I'm afraid that the only thing he has to show for it is the statue from before and the painting that was destroyed just now, right?"
<br><br>"No, it's not." Night Energy said solemnly, "The might of Sir is not something you can imagine."
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi laughed coldly.
<br><br>"Then why does he always refuse to show himself?"
<br><br>"I reckon that he was afraid when he saw the formation of my Baiyang True Palace, right?"
<br><br>"If not, then name a reason for him not to show up."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's words struck the minds of the three Night Energy people, hitting their perseverance heavily.
<br><br>"Father, sir wouldn't really?"
<br><br>Night Yi asked with an ugly face.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian, who was on the side, also turned his gaze to him.
<br><br>"No, it can't be."
<br><br>Night Energy gritted his teeth, his face full of determination.
<br><br>But his heart was holding on to his beliefs, but he couldn't say why Yi Feng was late in showing up.
<br><br>Seeing Night Energy stammering half a day unable to say anything, Lu Zhengyi was full of mockery.
<br><br>Sure enough, as he had expected.
<br><br>He had guessed Yi Feng's strength long before, and the probability was that he was the kind of person who cultivated in a special way.
<br><br>This kind of person either imperial talisman, or imperial beast, also some cultivate dead spirits as assistants, in short, this kind of cultivator controls a thousand and one things.
<br><br>But these people no matter which means, but they all have one thing in common, that is, their own strength is not strong.
<br><br>For example, they have a Tang Clan in the Lingxu Realm, this clan is famous for its puppetry, and the puppets they control have superb combat power, but their own strength is not as strong as the puppets they control.
<br><br>And the night can mouth that so-called Mr. ......
<br><br>should be exactly one such person.
<br><br>Only what he controls is not the puppet death spirit, but the previous wooden sculpture and the painting scroll that they destroyed.
<br><br>Therefore, this kind of alternative cultivator without the bottom card, its own is simply not enough for evidence.
<br><br>Coupled with the fact that Yi Feng did not appear for a long time, this further confirmed his thoughts.
<br><br>Far away.
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi three people saw this, shook up his head, and heaved a sigh.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian this step is ultimately the wrong ah!
<br><br>The one from the Green Ox Sect is strong, but it is the entire Baiyang True Palace that he has to face.
<br><br>I'm afraid it's really not going to appear.
<br><br>In this way, with the means of the White Sun True Palace, Jian Hengtian went to their opposite side, I am afraid that the Hengtian Sword Fast will also cease to exist.
<br><br>On the other side of the void, the middle-aged man and the old man also looked at this scene.
<br><br>"My lord, what do you think?" The old man asked.
<br><br>"I'm afraid that this person is similar to the kind of person Tang Zong is, at most, just taking the painting scroll and wooden sculpture to exert a little bit of power."
<br><br>The middle-aged man shook his head and said, "I thought I would come across a good seedling for my use, but now it seems that I have overestimated him."
<br><br>"What, you three still don't beg for mercy?"
<br><br>At this time, Lu Zhengyi stared at the three of Night Energy, and an icy voice came out.
<br><br>"Hmph, we are sir's people, we will not submit to you." Night Energy said firmly, "He will definitely appear and will definitely not spare you guys."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Hardcore?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's pupils shrank as his palm raised and covered the three with a palm.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The three spat blood, and under the powerful force, the lower half of their bodies sank directly into the earth, and their faces became depressed to the extreme.
<br><br>"Hmph, to tell you the truth, I'm afraid that your so-called gentleman has long run away, because his entire means is only that painting and that wooden sculpture, the wooden sculpture and the painting scroll were destroyed, he simply does not dare to appear again."
<br><br>"Of course, you guys don't worry, he destroyed my disciple's three seals, he ran to the ends of the earth, and he will be caught back."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said with a face full of mockery, stimulating the heart of Night Energy.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"Who said that sir's means is just that wooden carving and painting scroll?"
<br><br>Night Neng raised his head and responded with a face full of sarcasm: "That wood carving and painting scroll is just a little apprentice that sir has taught for half a month, at best that painting scroll was added by sir at random with two strokes."
<br><br>"And this level of wood carving and painting scroll, sir can produce with his hands!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Night Energy's words elicited sarcasm-filled smiles from the crowd of Bai Yang True Palace.
<br><br>"Made with your hands?"
<br><br>"Perhaps the old ancestor who started my Lingxu Realm back then was capable of making such statues with his hands, what is he that is worthy of saying such big words?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"How can a glowing fire know that the blazing sun only shines, you guys don't believe that, just that you are not qualified to know that level of Mr. at all." Night can hum in a deep voice.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi narrowed his eyes, the flesh of his face could not help but twitch, filled with gloom.
<br><br>If it were usual, with these words of Night Energy, he would have slapped over and smashed Night Energy into pieces.
<br><br>But he held back.
<br><br>Because this kind of alternative cultivators have certain means of escape, especially since the scrolls and wooden sculptures have been destroyed, it's not easy to really uncover the people behind them.
<br><br>The only, is through the night can three people will be provoked out of that person, so as to be able to save him a lot of energy.
<br><br>This is why, a mere night energy, worthy of him to waste so much breath.
<br><br>"I'll give you a chance to call him out, so that we can see how powerful the wooden carvings and painting scrolls he made with his hands are."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said with a face full of mockery.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as his words fell, a few light and airy sounds came from not far away.
<br><br>"Aiyaaah."
<br><br>"It's the first time I've seen such a desperate request."
<br><br>"In that case, then I will come and satisfy you."
