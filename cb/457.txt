"What?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi and the others' faces changed so much that their eyes were about to fall off.
<br><br>The super strong attack that dozens of them had condensed was actually dissolved so instantly?
<br><br>Before they could react, the wooden sculpture crowd attacked again, and the two sides battled together.
<br><br>The two sides were engaged in a battle, but it would be better to say a massacre.
<br><br>The situation was completely one-sided, screams of misery constantly came out from the mouths of the people of Baiyang True Palace.
<br><br>They were dying in various ways.
<br><br>Some were killed by a loli summoning a big bear and sitting on its butt.
<br><br>Some, were taken directly into the pagoda.
<br><br>Some were cut to pieces by flying robots.
<br><br>In addition, a variety of ways to die, staged in this ruin ...... first issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And those who survived, at this moment, have long lost their fighting spirit and fled like mad.
<br><br>However, in the twinkling of an eye, they were caught up by the wooden sculpture.
<br><br>"Ah, where did the spider web come from, let go of me."
<br><br>"What kind of shield is that, it actually blocked my immortal magic attack."
<br><br>"Ah, this watermelon head is so fast."
<br><br>"Don't, save me, this toad is licking me, ah, I'm being eaten."
<br><br>Just a moment's time.
<br><br>Baiyang true palace large dozens of people died only seven or eight left.
<br><br>And in contrast to the audience wooden sculpture, except for that auspicious cloud black robe, there is a crazy guy blew himself up, there is no damage at all.
<br><br>This little damage, compared to the hundreds of wooden sculptures, it is not painful.
<br><br>Looking at the corpses all over the ground, Lu Zhengyi stood there with a bloodless face, filled with dullness, his eyes had turned godless.
<br><br>Only at this moment did he realize how terrifying these wooden sculptures really were.
<br><br>Only then did he completely wake up to how wrong he was before.
<br><br>Just in his perception, the Immortal River continent is only 20 million years after the reboot era, the top of the day is that strength.
<br><br>Even if there are reincarnated, twenty million years, Su did not wake up also do not know it.
<br><br>But who would have thought that out of the door to step on such an iron plate?
<br><br>As the saying goes, one mistake is a thousand hates.
<br><br>A large White Sun True Palace, large dozens of Heavenly Immortal strength of experts, so buried.
<br><br>He understood.
<br><br>Baiyang True Palace, is finished.
<br><br>If you can turn back time, give him 10,000 guts, but he did not dare to provoke the master of the wooden sculpture.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>There is no medicine for regret in the world.
<br><br>Can't help but, he will be hateful gaze, looked at the not far behind the white shallow one, hate to thirsty white shallow one's flesh and blood.
<br><br>In fact, the circumstances of the matter, how can he not clear in his mind?
<br><br>Perhaps Bai Shanyi interest to seize people's wood carvings and paintings, but was chased and killed.
<br><br>And he himself is blind, believed in the compulsion of white shallow one, to protect the shortcomings to find trouble.
<br><br>But in the end, the cause of the matter, or because of the white shallow one.
<br><br>Under the anger, his red eyes towards the white shallow one step by step, full of strong killing intent.
<br><br>The white face of the white shallow one, perceived Lu Zhengyi's gaze, immediately shuddered.
<br><br>While her feet backed up, her mouth shouted in panic: "Master, don't, don't, I beg you."
<br><br>But just as her voice fell, Lu Zhengyi squeezed Bai Shanyi's neck.
<br><br>"Now Bai Yang True Palace has fallen into such a state, all because of you!" Lu Zhengyi said in a hoarse voice, while lifting Bai Shanyi up stiffly.
<br><br>Bai Shallow One's throat stammered for words and his face was turned red.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Bai Shallow One was flung out by Lu Zhengyi and landed at Wu Chang'an's feet with a bang.
<br><br>"This matter started because of this woman, let your Excellency do with it."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>Hearing Lu Zhengyi's voice, Bai Shanyi's face was bloodless, and he shouted out hysterically, crawling on his knees towards Lu Zhengyi, saying supplicatingly, "Master, I am your favorite disciple, you can't do this to me!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi waved a palm and sent Bai Shanyi flying again, landing at Wu Chang'an's feet.
<br><br>The wretched Bai Shanyi hurriedly got up again and kowtowed her head towards Wu Changan, crying out, "Spare my life, please don't kill me, as long as you don't kill me, I can be your maid, I can serve you and work as a cow, as long as I'm not killed around."
<br><br>At this moment, Bai Shanyi can be said to have completely lost his fighting spirit, completely without the high posture of the past.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>The entire Baiyang True Palace was reunited, what trouble she had caused, she cleared out as soon as she could.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Wu Changan, however, landed a palm on top of his head.
<br><br>"I'm not interested in you."
<br><br>"But you cursed my master, deserve to die."
<br><br>After saying that, Wu Chang'an's palm seal fell down violently.
<br><br>Bai Shanyi stared at his eyes, bleeding from his seven holes, and died a violent death directly on the ground.
<br><br>A generation of goddesses, just like this, fell.
<br><br>Like a dead dog.
<br><br>And after Bai Shallow One died, Lu Zhengyi led the remaining few people to kneel down with both knees, took off a ring, and presented it with both hands.
<br><br>"This ring is all the reserves of my Bai Yang True Palace, also handed over to your Excellency, today we are to blame, please tell that senior behind you, only one request, can spare the lives of my Bai Yang True Palace disciples, we are willing to end ourselves."
<br><br>Without waiting for Wu Chang'an to reply, Lu Zhengyi waved his palm, a cold mane swept through, and several experts behind him fell to the ground in response.
<br><br>"Hate!"
<br><br>Looking up to the sky, the last palm, after all, fell on his own head.
<br><br>Up to this point.
<br><br>White Sun True Palace sent out a terrifying lineup of large dozens of minimum are Heaven Immortal experts, completely reunited, no one left.
<br><br>Wu Changan let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>This Lu Zhengyi is also considered to have done the only right thing before he died.
<br><br>If he had woken up earlier, it would not have been so bad!
<br><br>But thinking back carefully, it makes sense.
<br><br>The power used by these wooden sculptures is not at all the power that exists in this world, Lu Zhengyi and others simply can not imagine their power, there is a miscalculation is indeed possible.
<br><br>And after the battle came to an end ......
<br><br>Wooden sculpture, a head of the haze, a dignified and benevolent appearance, a white dress like a celestial immortal-like woman, palm resting on the net bottle, hand brush willow appeared.
<br><br>Under the wave of the willow, the original collapsed buildings soon re-erected, the ground was filled with holes, and even many of the affected mortals, also came back to life.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>Baier City returned to its original appearance, as if the battle had never happened.
<br><br>And the crowd who witnessed the whole thing, all of them are not backed up with a cold breath.
<br><br>Especially that last haze woman, that hand of magical power, but they could not help but kneel down and worship.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>A wooden carving has such ability, that the master who made the wooden carving, that is not a god general?
<br><br>Yi Feng, has become the faith in their hearts.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian, the bet was right."
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi's face was complicated.
<br><br>The rest of the people were also silent for a long time and did not speak.
<br><br>On their faces, however, there was no doubt that they were filled with remorse.
<br><br>They, once again, had missed their chance, and this chance, I'm afraid, will not come again.
<br><br>For Jian Hengtian, who had seized the opportunity, they were full of envy.
<br><br>They also know that in the future, they can no longer keep up with Jian Hengtian's footsteps, three of the four sects, is already a name without substance.
<br><br>The hearts of the three were damaged.
<br><br>A few days later.
<br><br>Hengtian Jianzhai received a wooden sculpture from Wu Chang'an and rose completely.
<br><br>The other three sects, there is a big change, the three patriarchs resigned from the position of patriarch, stepped into the world into the Jinshan Temple, shaved monk.
<br><br>The top of a mountain peak.
<br><br>There is a middle-aged man sitting on his back, and next to the man, there is an old man standing.
<br><br>The man is running gong, a long long time before he lifted his head and looked at his chest.
<br><br>The wound.
<br><br>Recovered.
<br><br>Only then did he heaved a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"My Lord, that person's strength, far beyond our expectations ah, even the White Sun True Palace was reunited, this kind of strength, is certainly able to be used for you ah!" The old man said in a hurry.
<br><br>As soon as he heard this, the man's face was angry, a few chestnuts knocked on the old man's head.
<br><br>"I let you use, I let you use."
<br><br>"You are too long for my life, right?"
<br><br>"That guy's a wooden sculpture mistakenly hit the fist, almost killed me half, I still accept him to use?"
<br><br>"Have you got any brains, have you got any brains?"
<br><br>Speaking of which, the man is still having palpitations.
<br><br>Think of that day, he was watching the battle, suddenly a rubber-like arm stretched out, smashed his fist, this punch almost did not send him away, knocked several precious immortal pills, only to be considered the injury to stabilize.
<br><br>"Check it out, is there any other character worth more attention in this Immortal River Continent." The middle-aged man said with an iron face, "As for the owner of this wooden sculpture, I can't afford to mess with it."
<br><br>"Uh, there's really such a character."
<br><br>The old man hurriedly said, "I inquired that a black-robed man appeared a few days ago, he brought a dog, a centipede and a bear, scourging the clan forces of the Immortal River continent everywhere, and also defeated a few of the draconic beasts of the Upper Era of the Immortal River in the Central Continent."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"Black-robed man, a centipede and a dog, plus a bear?"
<br><br>"Scourge the major forces of the Immortal River, and also defeated the desolate beasts?"
<br><br>"A bit interesting!"
<br><br>The middle-aged man raised the corner of his mouth, judging from the introduction, wasn't this exactly the person he needed?
<br><br>So he hurriedly asked, "Do you know where that person is now?"
<br><br>"Your honor, if the guess is right, that black-robed man is still in the middle continent of the Immortal River!" The old man said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Go, go to the middle continent and look for him."
<br><br>The middle-aged man stood up, moved his muscles and bones, and then stepped out into the air.
