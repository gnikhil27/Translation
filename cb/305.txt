This look of Bones Ben Wei simply made Yi Feng angry and laugh.
<br><br>"This thing is you say you want can want?" Yi Feng said with a cold face: "Let's not say that the girl will accept you after knowing your appearance, even if you accept you can how?"
<br><br>"Take into the bridal chamber, you two how into, plan to play a night of mud?"
<br><br>"People's happiness ...... and how to do, you use your hands?"
<br><br>"After that girl if you want children and how to do, you are looking for the old king next door or the old Li across the street to help it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng this some soul torture, directly the skeleton Ben Wei to the whole confused, directly doubt life.
<br><br>"So hurry up and go, don't joke about the happiness of other girls."
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a serious tone: "You really want to play, when we go back to the martial arts school, I'll give you a look at where there is a deserted ancient tomb, I'll dig you a skeleton frame to play for you."
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei lowered his head.
<br><br>Finally, he let go of the tree he was holding tightly, and followed Yi Feng's departure with a sense of loss.
<br><br>That's all. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng took Zhong Qing Bone Ben Wei, embarked on a trip back to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Of course, followed by a dog, the dog's head, and lying on a centipede.
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing had just woken up from meditating and cultivating when a violent aura enveloped his entire small courtyard.
<br><br>"Desolate Wujing, get out of here!"
<br><br>Along with a clear and beautiful drink, a monstrous energy fluctuation pressed over at the same time.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing frowned, his palm slapped the ground, and the whole person met the air.
<br><br>A flip of the palm.
<br><br>A monstrous palm print appeared, and with it, it came into contact with that attack.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The sky resounded with a violent sonic boom, and the sky rolled up in turmoil, sending up a ripple of qi energy.
<br><br>Among the ripples.
<br><br>A woman with a devilish figure, wearing a revealing dress rolled out with a long whip in her hand, and then a whip came towards Desolate Pathless.
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolate Pathless rolled in the air to dodge a whip, while coldly shouting: "Su Mo Ye, what are you doing?"
<br><br>"Humph, still ask me what to do, I ask you, did you hide my man?" Su Moye shouted with a cold face.
<br><br>"What man?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing was full of doubts.
<br><br>"What man do you mean, just the man who snatched my embroidery ball a few days ago." Su Mo Ye drank.
<br><br>At that, Desolate Wujing was shocked.
<br><br>It feels like the embroidered ball that Skeleton Ben Wei snatched, is this woman's ah!
<br><br>He immediately felt a big head, and quickly said heartily, "Su Mo Ye, did you find the wrong person, I don't know the man you are talking about."
<br><br>"Hmph, still sophistry, I have checked clearly, my man lived in your place before, but now can not find anyone, quickly say, where exactly did you hide him." Su Mo Ye's slender jade hand tightly grasped the long whip, ready to launch an attack on Desolate Pathless.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing felt a headache.
<br><br>This woman seemed to know the relationship between him and Bone Ben Wei, it seems that there is no way to hide, so he could only say soothingly, "Don't be impulsive first, say something properly."
<br><br>"Then you should quickly say, where in the end my man went?"
<br><br>Su Moye said in a cold voice.
<br><br>"He was really here with me before, but now I really don't know." Desolate Wuji said with a bitter face, "After all, it's always impossible for me to control his whereabouts."
<br><br>"Hmph, I don't believe it."
<br><br>Su Mo Ye said directly: "I warn you Desolate Wu Jie, if you don't tell his whereabouts today, I'm not finished with you."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing's face was gloomy.
<br><br>Although he really did not want to provoke this woman, but being forced to this point, he also said stiffly: "Su Mo Ye, if you really want to fight, you are not necessarily my opponent, right?"
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Su Moye lifted her proud chin, turned her beautiful eyes and said meaningfully: "I'll put my words here today, if you don't give me the person, then I can't beat you and marry you."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The just hardened Desolate WuJi a shiver, suddenly goose, forehead is a drop of sweat, face iron said: "Miss Su, there is no need for this, the old man still want to live two more years."
<br><br>"Then since you still want to live for two more years, then hurry up and hand over my man." Su Mo Ye coldly shouted: "Or I will climb into your bed tonight."
<br><br>"No, no, no."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji waved his hands in a hurry and said in a panicked voice.
<br><br>In terms of fighting, he may not be afraid of this woman, but this woman to this set he is really afraid, after all, this woman is really let people scare.
<br><br>It's not that Su Mo Ye is ugly, rather this woman has a natural charm bone, plus that exquisite face and tall body, can be called a scourge level of beauty.
<br><br>But it is this kind of beauty, but has a gram man's life.
<br><br>Gram all and she is close to the man.
<br><br>And her story has long been legendary.
<br><br>In the early years of her training, she encountered a bully who forced her to marry, and the bully just walked into her house and died a violent death.
<br><br>Then there was a childhood friend, hidden inside the grove before holding hands, that childhood friend was directly struck dead by lightning.
<br><br>After the cultivation, there are no longer a few people who covet her beauty, but without exception died a violent death.
<br><br>Of course, the real horror for all, but also when she first came to the land of chaos.
<br><br>At that time, the land of chaos was ruled by a five life martial emperor, this martial emperor both means and strength are extremely strong, coupled with his violent character, so all the forces are pressed by him can not get out.
<br><br>At that time, that Martial Emperor took a glance at Su Mo Ye.
<br><br>He forced Su Moye, who was only a Martial Emperor at the time, to act as his dual cultivation partner.
<br><br>But he just took Su Moye, the accident happened.
<br><br>A spatial rift appeared in the air out of nowhere, pulling this Martial Emperor in, and the violent spatial turbulence instantly smashed this Martial Emperor into powder.
<br><br>After the death of this Martial Emperor, those forces that were suppressed were considered to see the light of day again.
<br><br>So far.
<br><br>Su Mo Ye's fame shook the land of chaos.
<br><br>After all, she was a woman who changed the layout of the entire chaotic land forces with her own power.
<br><br>Some people say.
<br><br>Su Moye is a Heavenly Fate lonely star, this life can only end up alone.
<br><br>Some people also say.
<br><br>She is the woman of the Heavenly Dao, cared for by the Heavenly Dao, any man who desecrates her, will be punished by the Heavenly Dao.
<br><br>And the famous Su Moye since then, directly after the release of the bold words.
<br><br>No matter what kind of man, as long as he can be her man and not die, no matter what kind of man, even if it is a mountain woodcutter will also marry him.
<br><br>Afterwards she will be happy to find a man, every few years will throw an embroidery ball, get a match.
<br><br>Because of her status and beauty, every time there is always fear of death to compete for this spot, but the results are all kinds of death, struck by lightning, fire into the magic, and even outrageous even choke to death by drinking water have ......
<br><br>But who knows, this time the embroidered ball, but let the skeleton Ben Wei to grab.
<br><br>"No wonder the Yi Feng brothers to take him away, I'm afraid that even with their strength, also have more than scruples about this woman!"
<br><br>Desolate without path sighed.
<br><br>Looking at Su Moye's burning gaze, he thought slightly and then said: "Su Moye, to tell you the truth, the one who grabbed your embroidered ball has gone, you can't find them, you'd better give up!"
<br><br>"Gone?"
<br><br>Su Moye frowned, the hand of the long whip fiercely waved, a snap, the ground threw a hundred feet long gully.
<br><br>"I can't easily come across one that has lasted this long without dying, how can I let you get away?"
<br><br>With a cold snort, Su Moye was about to leave to find someone.
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolation No Trail drink: "Su Mo Ye, remind you, he is not an ordinary person, is the strength of the high people beyond your imagination, advise you not to ask for trouble."
<br><br>"A high person of great strength?"
<br><br>Su Moye turned around and looked at Desolate Pathless, raised the corners of her mouth and sneered: "Robbed my mother's embroidery ball, even if it is a god, as long as it does not die, then it is also my mother's people."
<br><br>Saying that, she turned into a stream of light swept out of the air and disappeared in the blink of an eye ......
