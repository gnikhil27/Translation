Yi Feng carried the small bamboo building with the canyon all the way down.
<br><br>While Wu Yonghong and the others listened to his command and hurried back towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Tianxin Tan?"
<br><br>And after running around for most of the day, Yi Feng finally found his target and saw it growing alone on a hairless cliff face from afar.
<br><br>Like a winter blooming plum blossom, it was so different!
<br><br>Yi Feng put the bamboo basket on the ground, took out the small shovel he carried and stuck it in his waist, clapped his palms and climbed towards that cliff wall in an attempt to pick that one heavenly heart tantalum.
<br><br>Not far away.
<br><br>An old tree hung with dead vines, a black-feathered raven attached to it, and next to the raven crawled a large centipede.
<br><br>The eyes of the two animals actually shone with a humane color.
<br><br>"How about this Heavenly Heart Tan?"
<br><br>Suddenly, the crow said with a human mouth. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Your Honor, Lord Black Feather, this Heavenly Heart Tantalum is already ripe, depending on when Lord Demon Emperor will come to pick it."
<br><br>At the same time, the centipede also spat out human words.
<br><br>"Well, Lord Demon Emperor is in seclusion these two days, after he comes out of seclusion in two days, he will come over and pick it personally." Crow solemnly said, "This Heavenly Heart Tantalum is very important to Lord Demon Emperor, you have to guard it well in the last two days, nothing must go wrong."
<br><br>"Yes, Lord Black Feather!" The centipede said respectfully.
<br><br>"Well!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the crow then nodded in satisfaction, while his gaze subconsciously looked towards the Heavenly Heart Tantalum.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>The crow feathers almost fell off in shock, in the middle of their conversation, a human had actually climbed next to Tian Xin Tan.
<br><br>"Quick, stop that damn human." The crow shouted.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the centipede was also shocked.
<br><br>Then came the extreme anger, the countless feet climbing on the trunk of the tree, quickly rushed towards that heavenly heart tantalum.
<br><br>The crow was also not willing to lag behind, after all, as a flying demon beast, he was much faster than the centipede, immediately flapping his wings, his sharp beak flashed out a cold aura, and rushed directly towards that human.
<br><br>"It's really good stuff!"
<br><br>Yi Feng observed the Tianxin tantalum in front of him, revealing a satisfied smile, and was just about to pick it when he found a crow rushing directly towards him.
<br><br>Unable to help himself, Yi Feng dodged the crow with a slight inclination of his head.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Crow face incredulous, obviously this human is only a mortal, but so easily dodge his blow?
<br><br>Especially seeing that this human palm are to the top of the Heavenly Heart Tantra, the crow full of anger suddenly burst out, the wings spread, huge demon power condensed between the two holdings, with the beat, a burst of demon power turned into a shock wave towards Yi Feng cover.
<br><br>"Rub, what's wrong wit this crow, is its brain damaged?"
<br><br>Distracted by that wing, Yi Feng waves his palm fiercly, as a gesture of repulsion.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>With Yi Feng's wave of palm, the demon power suffered a huge shock wave and was directly waved away, which makes the crow reveal a strong color of disbelief.
<br><br>This is?
<br><br>It's a tough fight!
<br><br>The Crow looked at the human in front of the two of them, want to directly pick the heavenly heart tantalum, crow was mortified.
<br><br>The crows were so excited that they were able to get to the top of the list.
<br><br>"Where did the idiot crow come from, get lost!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was annoyed by this crow, pulled out the small shovel from behind him, and threw a shovel over.
<br><br>"Pop!"
<br><br>This shovel hit 100%, directly slapped the crow on the cliff wall, popping out all over the feathers, and then smashed on the ground, dead as can be.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Just halfway up the centipede saw this scene, suddenly the soul flew away, feet and claws are bent up in fear, played a circle around a rock, moved countless paws on the run.
<br><br>The famed Lord Black Feather, actually was shot dead by a shovel, how could he a small centipede be his opponent ah!
<br><br>This human is definately not mortal ah, simply too scary!
<br><br>And to snatch the Heavenly Heart Tantalum, I have to hurry to report to the Lord Demon Emperor.
<br><br>Soon, he went into the rock crevice, disappeared, and I do not know whether it was too fast or what, the dense legs also broke two.
<br><br>And after slapping the crows to death, Yi Feng finally picked the Heavenly Heart Tantalum as he wished, with this Heavenly Heart Tantalum in hand, his mission for this trip, is considered to have completed a third!
<br><br>"The next one, water spirit grass, to have water."
<br><br>Yi Feng opened his map and headed towards his next destination.
