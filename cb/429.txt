"En, quite good."
<br><br>Zhu made the light stand with his hands on his head, and his every move carried an aura of majesty.
<br><br>Then said in a serious tone toward the two people: "Although you are just miscellaneous disciples, but do not be discouraged."
<br><br>"To have a calm, down-to-earth heart, do not rush to say that after entering the sect, want to want to cultivate to what realm, to take one step at a time, slowly."
<br><br>"In short, haste is not urgent."
<br><br>"Especially you, the new one, did you hear me."
<br><br>Saying that, he looked his gaze towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Zhu made the light nod in satisfaction and said, "But don't worry, since you are on the mountain, I will definitely let you learn your skills." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Even if the talent is not good, my Green Ox Clan can easily break this tradition, after all, my Green Ox Clan has a long heritage and a deep heritage."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Zhu makes a big wave of his hand.
<br><br>"Think back in the day, my old ancestor of the Green Ox Clan, was a Martial King expert!"
<br><br>"That was a famous existence in several hundred miles around."
<br><br>"Although he has fallen nowadays, he has left behind a large amount of resources and countless inheritances for my Green Ox Clan."
<br><br>"As long as you sink your hearts and cultivate well, these great inheritances may fall to you in the future."
<br><br>After saying that, looking at the several people who nodded, Zhu made the light reveal a satisfied smile, secretly saying that these two mortals should not run away after some chicken soup for the soul from him.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>"This Sovereign will leave first."
<br><br>Zhu made light with his hands out of the door, looking at Yi Feng and others who sent out the door, once again emitted a majestic voice.
<br><br>"You guys cultivate well, sooner or later you will be able to reach my realm, flying to the sky and disappearing to the earth, turning the clouds and overturning the rain, are not dreams."
<br><br>After saying that, Zhu made light fiercely stepped on the ground, and his body suddenly rose up to meet the air.
<br><br>Under the breeze, a slightly white long hair fluttering in the wind, the body of the green robe also blew hunting, immortal bones of his feet on the void, such as the exiled immortal fly away from the small courtyard.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just flew out not long, accidentally hung up to the tree.
<br><br>Under the pull, half of the buttocks were exposed.
<br><br>"Sloppy, sloppy, just pretend than did not look at the road!"
<br><br>"Phew, lucky not to be seen."
<br><br>Zhu makes the light cautiously surveyed around, saw no one around, then breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>A few moments later, Zhu makes the light fly up again.
<br><br>On the tree, however, there was a torn pair of pants left behind, fluttering in the wind ......
<br><br>Just like this.
<br><br>Yi Feng's days went on calmly in the Green Bull Sect.
<br><br>Although it is a handyman disciple, but the good thing is that there is not much work, in addition to what things did not learn, Yi Feng's days are also leisurely.
<br><br>But compared to Yi Feng's leisure, Wu Chang'an is worried every day.
<br><br>He really can not see what this one wants to do, but actually in this small sect as a mortal.
<br><br>But Wu Chang'an did not dare to say, did not dare to ask, and did not dare to provoke, only dare to cooperate.
<br><br>As for escaping ......
<br><br>Since that day he used his last resort to refine a teleportation talisman, just ready to teleport away, was Yi Feng a snatch over the wipe the nose, but also rubbed a hole to destroy the teleportation talisman, he completely understand, no matter how he can not escape this person's palm.
<br><br>So far, he is completely put off the idea of escape.
<br><br>So Yi Feng let do what to do, at any time in front of Yi Feng in a respectful posture.
<br><br>The side looking at Wu Changan's Yi Feng, heart can not help but feel.
<br><br>This buddy is so afraid of himself, I guess he thought he had the cultivation, right?
<br><br>It should be.
<br><br>This can't help but let Yi Feng feel a wave of being feared.
<br><br>How nice.
<br><br>This kind of awe is completely different than the politeness of that group of old men and women in Pingjiang City towards him!
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng, I've brought you some delicious food."
<br><br>And at this time, Xiao Mai ran quickly and took out two chicken legs from her arms, one handed to Yi Feng and one handed to Wu Changan.
<br><br>"You're too polite, right?" Yi Feng took the chicken legs with embarrassment, while saying, "Also, you are my senior sister, it's not good to keep calling me brother."
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng taught me to play chess, taught me carving, and taught me to write, of course I have to give you delicious food."
<br><br>Xiaodai said with a smile, hand dancing around the side, seemingly showing off her new dress she wore today.
<br><br>"As for the name calling well ...... because you are obviously older than me, it's weird to keep calling you senior brother, so it's better to call brother Yi Feng."
<br><br>Saying that, she turned her gaze to the side of Wu Tao, smiling and asking, "You say right, Wu Tao senior brother."
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"You're right."
<br><br>Wu Tao's mouth twitched and he nodded awkwardly.
<br><br>"Okay, okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng really couldn't refuse this little girl.
<br><br>But this girl is quite likeable, looking for him every day and bringing him something to eat every day.
<br><br>"Brother Yi Feng, come over here."
<br><br>At this time, Xiaodai multiplied Wu Chang'an into the room, and she hurriedly waved at Yi Feng with a quiet and comical look.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng walked over curiously.
<br><br>"I ah, from the master got a pill, you said you have no talent, you eat this pill, maybe you can cultivate it."
<br><br>"But I only have one, you must not let senior brother Wu Tao know, or he will be uncomfortable in his heart."
<br><br>Saying that, she opened her big eyes towards the surroundings, saw no one around, and secretly stuffed it into Yi Feng's hand.
