"This crappy martial school, it doesn't even have a name, so I guess it's no surprise that it's trash again."
<br><br>As he walked, Jing Wu Chen surveyed the martial arts school.
<br><br>Suddenly, his footsteps beat.
<br><br>His eyes fell on the only word on the plaque.
<br><br>"Wu?"
<br><br>He frowned, always feeling that the plaque was hiding something, but after observing it for half a day, he didn't find anything.
<br><br>Can't help but, he smiled disdainfully.
<br><br>With a wave of his hand, a qi dou shot out, towards the "martial" plaque dou shot.
<br><br>The palm of his hand fell, he did not look again, directly into the martial arts school, because a broken plaque to, under his means, there is no other end - only shattered.
<br><br>Only, he did not know that his qi energy, not only did not cause half damage to the martial plaque, not even leaving a trace.
<br><br>After walking into the front hall, Jing Wuzhen directly slashed out with a palm, wanting to destroy the front hall first. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But when he contains a strong Yuan Qi palm shot, but did not cause a little movement, on the contrary, the walls hanging on both sides of the eighteen pictures abruptly emitted a dazzling bright light.
<br><br>Then without the slightest lag, swords, spears, swords, halberds ...... eighteen weapons fiercely condensed in shape above his head, carrying a destructive aura towards him.
<br><br>Jing Wuzhen's already morbid face changed abruptly, and under that pressure, his face was suddenly as white as paper.
<br><br>He understood that he had encountered a shocking crisis.
<br><br>His heart was not as frivolous as before, and he did not dare to be the least bit careless. Almost immediately, he took out the Heaven-shattering Stone given to him by Old Man Xuanwu.
<br><br>Once the Heaven-shaking Stone came out, it immediately emitted a dazzling brilliance.
<br><br>But in just an instant, it turned dull and lusterless under the mighty pressure of the eighteen weapons.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Jing Wuzhen's heart was greatly alarmed, no longer having the means to resist, he could only watch as the eighteen weapons descended overhead, getting closer and closer.
<br><br>In the light of day, condensed eighteen weapons staggered, net no dust can even scream, directly ashes, leaving only the shock stone "crunch", fell on the floor.
<br><br>"What's that noise?"
<br><br>The drowsy Yi Feng was about to fall asleep when he was awakened by the sound and sat up.
<br><br>Then he took Zhong Qing towards the front hall and found that the hall was empty except for a stone that was quite bigger than a slate.
<br><br>"Shit."
<br><br>"Which unqualified son of a bitch threw a stone at Laozi's house!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed, approached a look, found that the floor were smashed collapsed a piece, immediately distressed, chased out to see, also found that there is no figure.
<br><br>"No quality dog thing, I curse you to give birth to a son without farts."
<br><br>Can not find the main, Yi Feng can only curse and spit, after spitting towards Zhong Qing commanded: "Disciple, help me to throw this broken stone out."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing picked up the stone with difficulty and walked towards the outside, just two steps, seemed to remember something and said, "Master, I look at the stone size is quite suitable, why don't I carry it to the door to fill the steps?"
<br><br>Hearing Zhong Qing say so, Yi Feng's eyes lit up.
<br><br>You do not say, it is really.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng nodded his head and ordered: "That's fine, just put it at the door, this unqualified bastard is also considered to be a willow."
<br><br>But this thing to Yi Feng is also a stalk.
<br><br>He has always been easy to treat people, and no one has a grudge, how can someone use such a large stone to throw his martial arts school.
<br><br>I can't figure it out.
<br><br>Because Zhong Qing has completely healed, so the next few days Yi Feng are teaching Zhong Qing new boxing, but also did not go out much.
<br><br>Xuanwu Sect.
<br><br>Demon Ling'er came to the main hall and stood respectfully in front of Ning Xuanwu.
<br><br>"Master, Brother Wudu has been there for so many days, there is no movement, something is not right!" Demon Ling'er couldn't help but say.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu smiled, his eyebrows also slightly wrinkled.
<br><br>According to reason, so many days have passed, no matter what net no dust should also have news, but half a letter is not, is indeed a bit abnormal.
<br><br>"Heartless, you go down the mountain to see, find the dustless together rendezvous, and then come back to report to me."
<br><br>The Xuanwu old ancestor gazed at the cloaked man on the side and commanded in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Jing Wuxin nodded respectfully, the cloak behind him waved, and immediately disappeared into the hall ......
