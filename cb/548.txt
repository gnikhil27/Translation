All the dust settled.
<br><br>Perdition and the ruler of the Cloud Top Kingdom raised their glasses to each other in the palace.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"To the success of this one!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch said with a big smile.
<br><br>"A toast is a toast, but can your underground palace killing formation be foolproof?" Perish the World said with doubt.
<br><br>"Don't worry!"
<br><br>Genting Kingdom Monarch said confidently, "This killing formation was left behind several eras ago, experienced a great destruction, formed itself into a small barren world, inside countless dead spirits, completely a lifeless place."
<br><br>"In addition."
<br><br>"I also deliberately sent my seven female disciples to guard over there."
<br><br>"Is your outstanding talent, born with a charming body, commonly known as the cloud top seven charmers of those few?" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The exterminator's eyes were raised.
<br><br>"Good, it's them."
<br><br>"As long as there is a slight problem, they will immediately tell us the news!" The Genting kingdom ruler said with a smile.
<br><br>"That's very good."
<br><br>After hearing the series of arrangements made by the Genting Kingdom Monarch, Perdition also nodded his head in satisfaction.
<br><br>"All in all, don't worry, they will die!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch raised his cup and laughed.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, they will die!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Perdition also raised his cup.
<br><br>The two of them gently clinked.
<br><br>Inside the Desolate Killing Formation.
<br><br>The four drunken Bone Ben Wei, slept for more than ten hours before waking up leisurely.
<br><br>"Brother, we seem to be caught look."
<br><br>Milk agent one hand grabbed from the collection of scriptures out of the bear has not yet finished reading, while scratching his head said.
<br><br>"An la an la, caught, caught, with brother in what is the big deal." Night Wind Centipede turned over and waved his paws unconcernedly and said.
<br><br>"That's right, and look at this place seems to be quite fun." The dog climbed up and also began to pick up the cavity: "And didn't brother steal the master gold coins, it just so happens that brother said to take shelter from the wind, it's not just here to take shelter from the wind?"
<br><br>"Do you think so?"
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>The dog turned his gaze to Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>"This scum also think so, only to avoid the wind to avoid the wind, still have to find some fun ah."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei propped up his chin and nodded his head in a rather handsome manner.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"Brother, you quickly say, what kind of fun?"
<br><br>A few of the dogs hastily flocked towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, look for it first."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei heatedly smiled.
<br><br>Then the bone palm raised and grabbed a transparent object into his hand and drummed it up in a serious manner.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>With a burst of drumming from Bone Ben Wei, the transparent object in his hand transformed into a hideous human form, and a harsh voice came out.
<br><br>"Let go of me."
<br><br>"Do you know, whose subordinate I am?"
<br><br>"I am the subordinate of this desolate realm, the largest death spirit spirit king, if you don't let go of me in a hurry, the spirit king will definitely not let you go!"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>His voice had just fallen.
<br><br>A cold voice suddenly came out of Bone Benevolent's mouth, "The Spirit King you are talking about, is this thing?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The undead who had just shouted would look over and instantly discovered to his horror that Bone Ben Wei had somehow grabbed his Spirit King, which he was so proud of, into his hands as well.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>How?
<br><br>This death spirit felt his scalp tingling.
<br><br>Their Spirit King was the most powerful death spirit in the Desolate Realm!
<br><br>"Spirit Spirit Spirit Spirit King, how can you do that too?"
<br><br>He stared at the Spirit King and stammered out his voice.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>The Spirit King roared in anger.
<br><br>Then without saying a word he opened his huge mouth and swallowed the dead spirit in one gulp.
<br><br>After baring his mouth for a few mouthfuls, he revealed a playful look and laughed heatedly at Skeleton Benevolence, "My Lord, I don't know him!"
<br><br>"Oh yo, a little pattern."
<br><br>Seeing this, Bone Ben Wei looked at this Spirit King quite admiringly, then with a loose grip, he dropped him to the ground.
<br><br>"Thank you, my lord."
<br><br>After regaining his freedom, the Spirit King secretly let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately.
<br><br>Luckily, he reacted quickly.
<br><br>Otherwise, he would have died.
<br><br>Just now he was happily devouring other dead spirits, when suddenly a palm appeared from nowhere and told him to grab it.
<br><br>Thinking about that horrible scene just now, he understood profoundly that the character in front of him absolutely cannot be provoked.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, a few lords, I wonder what's important to come here?"
<br><br>The Spirit King immediately kneeled on the ground and said with a smile, "I am the most powerful death spirit in this Desolate Realm, of course I am not expressing how powerful I am, I am still a younger brother in front of several lords, I just want to express that if several lords need help, perhaps I can help a little bit, hehehehehehehehe ......"
<br><br>"Oh, we just came to take a vacation and leave in a few days."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei raised his hand and said, "But this scum quite appreciate you, the future of our brothers, on your body."
<br><br>"Small meaning, small meaning, I will do my best as a host, a few lords if you have any orders just say." The Spirit King said with a nod and a bow.
<br><br>"Oh, then come here, I'll ask you ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei hooked his finger.
<br><br>The Spirit King hurriedly approached.
<br><br>"This slag man ask you, can you arrange the girl ah?" Said, skeleton Ben Wei in front of the chest waved, and lifted, whispered: "Just the kind, very dominant and domineering kind?"
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei these words.
<br><br>All of a sudden, the Spirit King was in a difficult position.
<br><br>"Uh, my lord, you see us like this, where can we get a girl?" The Spirit King said bitterly.
<br><br>"No sister?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei was instantly upset and said with a cold face, "Then how do you usually solve it?"
<br><br>"Lord, you should not mention this matter." The Spirit King said bitterly, "I haven't had meat for several eras."
<br><br>Looking at the Spirit King's despondent appearance, Bone Ben Wei, who was originally angry, instead threw a comforting look at him.
<br><br>"You suffer, brother also understand."
<br><br>"But I still have to teach you, physically not, psychologically you always have to find some solace ah!"
<br><br>"Brother lesson is, brother lesson is."
<br><br>The Spirit King bowed and nodded his head, still afraid of not arranging a girl for Skeleton Benevolent, and a slap on the wrist to kill him.
<br><br>But just after finishing.
<br><br>He suddenly remembered something, and his eyes lit up.
<br><br>"My lord, I have thought of a way." He shouted.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei let out a startled cry and turned his gaze towards him.
<br><br>"Just outside this Desolate Realm, there are seven sisters with white skin, all of them flirtatious."
