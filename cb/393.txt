The crowd was worried and silent for a long time.
<br><br>"The immortal world seems to have intervened as well."
<br><br>At this time, the giant glacier face said again, "Although the one who came down is just a small nuisance, it is likely to be a scout sent down by the Immortal World."
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>If the Immortal Realm intervened again, then the entire Immortal River Continent would definitely turn into a maelstrom.
<br><br>"Think of a way, at least first, to find out the person behind the Immortal River Continent before the Immortal Realm intervenes."
<br><br>The giant face of earth and mist gazed at the crowd and said in a deep voice: "After all, everyone can see in their hearts that, just from the power of that punch, none of us should be his opponent."
<br><br>"Good point, no matter what this person's purpose is, we should at least know who he is!" On the side, the lava giant face came out with a voice of approval: "If we don't know anything and are kept in the dark, then I'm afraid the first to lose is ours."
<br><br>"I also agree."
<br><br>Glacier giant face said: "No matter what hatred or grudge between us, I hope we can join forces to find out the identity of this person for the time being."
<br><br>At one time, several giant faces spoke. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Then at the same time, their eyes fell on the human woman and asked in a voice: "Tu Yoyo, what about you?"
<br><br>"Me?"
<br><br>"I'm not as ambitious as you guys, I'm satisfied to be able to live and watch the show by the way, so I'm not going to get involved."
<br><br>Said, the human woman Tu Yoyao took a step back on her legs and passed out.
<br><br>The crowd's face sank.
<br><br>"Tu Yoyao, at such a critical moment, you think you can stay out of it just because you are human?" Glacier giant face coldly shouted.
<br><br>"Good, to play to the end, the only way is to grasp the first opportunity, one more person is one more power." The giant face of earth and mist said the same.
<br><br>However, Tu Yoyo was unmoved.
<br><br>"Just!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd coldly shouted and said, "Don't mind her, with the power of a few of us it should be enough."
<br><br>"Yes, it's already enough, just how to act?
<br><br>"I suggest that we fuse these doppelgangers of ours together and perform the art of boundary divination together to find out the true identity of that person." The giant face of earth and mist suggested.
<br><br>"I agree, the fusion of the power of our doppelgangers is equivalent to the power of any of our real bodies, plus the casting of the Boundary Divination Technique, even if we can't find out the person, we will be able to find out where the person's location is." The ice and fog giant face said.
<br><br>At these words, the rest of the people nodded their heads.
<br><br>After saying that, the giant faces disappeared.
<br><br>In their place was an earth-colored fog, a thick flame, an appalling cold air, and a ball of water that swirled constantly ......
<br><br>They linger in the clouds constantly, emitting a terrifying aura, the process, so that the surrounding air flooded layers of ripples, and then under the eyes of the naked eye, condensed into a black fog.
<br><br>Black fog from time to time condensed out of the giant face of the glacier, and from time to time condensed out of the giant face of lava, fluctuations constantly, looks bizarre to the extreme.
<br><br>"Tu Yoyo, give you one last chance, want to join forces?" The black fog condensed out of the giant face of earth and fog and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I said, I do not get involved."
<br><br>Tu Yoyo said expressionlessly, "At the same time I suggest you, better give up this intention as well, otherwise you are afraid you will regret ......"
<br><br>"Regret?"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>The black fog changed its face, and came out the loud laughter of each person.
<br><br>"Tu Yao Yao ah Tu Yao Yao, even though it is only the coalescence of a few of our doppelgangers, but do you know how powerful we are now?"
<br><br>"Even if it's your real body now, it won't take much effort to defeat you."
<br><br>The black mist coalesced the face of the earth and mist giant, and a deep voice came out.
<br><br>"Then you can try."
<br><br>Tu Yoyo slightly raised his head, not afraid of the threat of the earth-mist giant's face in the slightest.
<br><br>"All right."
<br><br>The black fog coalesced out of the glacial giant face, and he scolded, "Don't waste time, if she doesn't want to, she won't want to, and the one who will regret in the future will definitely be herself, so why force it?"
<br><br>"Also right."
<br><br>The voice of the giant face of earth and fog came from the black fog.
<br><br>When the voice fell, the black fog spread out abruptly, actually spreading the entire Immortal River Continent in an instant.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>Countless information about the entire Immortal River Continent invisibly appeared in the minds of several people.
<br><br>"In Eastern Victory!"
<br><br>A voice came out from the black fog.
<br><br>In the next moment, the black fog that spread across the entire Immortal River Continent instantly closed to the range of East Victory.
<br><br>The sky of East Victory was steeply overcast.
<br><br>"It feels like it's going to rain again!"
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng brought Bone Ben Wei to the entrance of the martial arts school, looked up at the foggy sky, and couldn't help but pass out his voice.
<br><br>After saying that, he ran towards the inner courtyard.
<br><br>Trot at the same time, the mouth while praying, "buddy, so long I forgot about you, one did not feed you some water, two did not feed you something, you do not die ah!"
<br><br>Walking to the inner courtyard, a vertical two long whiskers of the head moved.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately, this snail did not die, dead, he really do not know where to get a snail like this.
<br><br>Good.
<br><br>Yi Feng just want to move this snail to the island, as a protective mountain god beast.
<br><br>Although only a name, but you have seen such a big snail?
<br><br>So it is not how you want to blow, anyway, can fool people on the right.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei will look to the sky.
<br><br>The snail also raised its head at the same time, only slowly.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>Skeleton Benway emitted his voice.
<br><br>"Bulu Bulu."
<br><br>A voice came out of the snail's mouth.
<br><br>"Abba abba."
<br><br>"Brrrrrrrrr ......"
<br><br>"Abba."
<br><br>"Brulu ...... let me make up for it."
<br><br>"Aba ......."
<br><br>Bones Benway wanted to say something, but finally nodded and lowered his head not to look at the sky.
