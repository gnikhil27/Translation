"Ye Bei, what do you mean by that?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan was filled with confusion by Ye Bei's actions and said with a blue face.
<br><br>"Ahem, what kind of words are you saying, Old Brother Qingshan?" Ye Bei piled up a thick smile on his face, wrapped an arm around Old Brother Qingshan's shoulder and said with a smile, "Didn't I just say, it was a misunderstanding misunderstanding, it was my negligence to lock Old Brother in this big formation, I'll make amends, make amends."
<br><br>Just like that, Ye Bei invited Old Man Qingshan politely out of the big formation.
<br><br>"Come on, brothers of the Explosive Sky Gang, set out for me the good wine and meat of the Explosive Sky Gang to entertain the brothers of the Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak was still full of doubts about the perverse Ye Bei.
<br><br>Just when he thought that Ye Bei would cheat, he unbelievably found that Ye Bei opened the mountain gate of the Explosive Heavenly Gang wide and invited the entire Castle Peak Sect in.
<br><br>This move shocked the old ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>This degree of opening the mountain door, even if Ye Bei's strength is high, but it is undoubtedly the belly of the Explosive Heavenly Gang on the tip of the knife of the Castle Peak Gate ah!
<br><br>"Master uncle, this Ye Bei in the end what mothballing ah?" Zhu Yun came close to the Castle Peak Old Ancestor and asked with a wary face, "Could it be an attempt to harm us?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan frowned and shook his head, "Although I don't know what he's up to, but we've all been sealed in the grand formation, there's no need for him to do more than that." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Zhu Yun also nodded his head.
<br><br>They were all already turtles in a jar, so there was really no need to do this to harm them.
<br><br>"Then ......"
<br><br>Zhu Yun looked at the Castle Peak Ancestor.
<br><br>"This Ye Bei is a Martial Emperor after all, and the lives of so many of our disciples are pinched in his hands, first follow in, take one step and see what happens!"
<br><br>After saying that, Old Ancestor Qingshan and a group of other senior people were also invited inside the Heaven Frying Gang.
<br><br>Subsequently, in the broad martial arts arena of the Heaven Frying Gang, Ye Bei gave an order to set up a banquet of 100,000 tables to entertain the disciples of the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>And at the top, with Ye Bei Qingshan old ancestor as the leader, the top brass of the two sects were all seated.
<br><br>Looking at this table of the mountains and seafood, forgiving to the state of mind of the old ancestor of Castle Peak, also could not help but stunned, many things he had never seen.
<br><br>This table is worth a lot of money!
<br><br>"Haha, Old Brother Qingshan, the first time you come to my Explosive Sky Gang, you must eat well and drink well!" Ye Bei said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>As his voice fell, he waved his palm again.
<br><br>"Someone, bring up my big treasure and present it to Old Brother Qingshan."
<br><br>Afterwards, a slender maid brought a jade tray, and on top of the jade tray, a delicate red box was placed.
<br><br>"This box?"
<br><br>Old Brother Qing Shan took a glance at it and was surprised in his heart because the cost of this box alone was not expensive, as if it was made of a rare red fragrant wood.
<br><br>"Old brother, I have a good thing here!"
<br><br>Ye Bei picked up that red box, while introducing, "This is a smoky sandalwood made by the refiners of my Explosive Sky Gang, using many valuable materials such as Hua Root, Zi Ling Leaves and so on, named Hua Zi Sandalwood, also known as Hua Zi for short."
<br><br>"Old brother, I really do not blow, this Huazi mass production of twenty a year, Ba a mouthful of custody you float immortal, topping you more than ten days of hard work, usually I do not want to take out, today, old brother came, I just want to take out."
<br><br>Saying that, he pulled out a Huazi from the mahogany box.
<br><br>Sure enough, once the huazi came out, it carried a strong fragrance, and it seemed that the refinement of cultivation had improved a few points.
<br><br>"Come on, light up the huazi for Old Brother Qing Shan."
<br><br>Castle Peak old ancestor frowned at the Huazi in front of him, also pressed the desire to Ba a mouthful, but Ye Bei acted abnormally, things must have a demon, he still held back y confusion, asked in a deep voice: "Ye Bei, what do you have to say!"
<br><br>"Old brother you see what kind of words you are saying?" Ye Bei made a fake face and said angrily, "Do I, as an old brother, have to have any purpose in inviting you for a meal?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan still had a stern face.
<br><br>"Okay, old brother, let me also tell the truth, before it was my Ye Bei's fault, it was me who impulsively put old brother and others into the great formation without checking the facts." Speaking of this, Ye Bei showed a touch of anger, said in a deep voice: "I only found out later, those three bastards, actually concealed from me to go out and do those bad deeds, alas, ashamed to say ah ......"
<br><br>Looking at Ye Bei this full of justice remarks, let the old ancestor of Castle Peak eyes amazed.
<br><br>"Someone, bring those three bastards up to me." Ye Bei waved his hand and said.
<br><br>Soon, those three martial spirits were brought up, the three had bitter faces, and as soon as they saw Ye Bei, they shouted, "Gang master, what do you mean by that, didn't you say you would protect us without worry and that you would help us take revenge?"
<br><br>"Hmph, three bastards, still talking big even now!"
<br><br>Saying that, Ye Bei waved his palm, three heads fell to the ground, and the three didn't understand what was going on until they died.
<br><br>"Ahem, old brother, these three heads are yours!"
<br><br>Ye Bei said in a righteous manner.
<br><br>Ye Bei's series of tactics made the old ancestor of Qingshan feel satisfied and at the same time his heart felt a little ashamed, it turned out that he, Qingshan, had measured the gentleman's belly with the heart of a villain.
<br><br>"Old brother, this Huazi, can Ba a mouthful, right?"
<br><br>Dispose of the three, Ye Bei hands holding up Huazi, said with a smile.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Nodding his head, the old ancestor of Green Mountain, then readily agreed, after all, Ye Bei is so frank, he squirmed again would not be able to say, took the Huazi.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Bei hurriedly gave the point.
<br><br>A mouthful of huazi ba down, refreshing into the heart and lungs, accompanied by a mouthful of thick smoke exhaled, sure enough, the body's yuan qi are mobilized, cultivation is a few points more pure.
<br><br>"It's really good stuff!"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain couldn't help but praise.
<br><br>"Haha, since old brother likes it, this whole box, old brother, under you." Ye Bei said atmospherically.
<br><br>"This, how can I be embarrassed about this?"
<br><br>The old ancestor Qing Shan said embarrassed, but at the same time, the palm of his hand but dishonestly received the red box in his arms, such a good thing, this box Ba down, but can save him a year of hard work ah!
<br><br>Then, it was time to drink freely.
<br><br>This wine, but for martial arts cultivation special brew, less than an hour, the old ancestor of Qingshan and other people drink up the inner eight, crushing small steps at the same time, each face rosy.
<br><br>"Come on, send the old man to rest."
<br><br>Ye Bei hurriedly sent someone to order.
<br><br>Soon, there were several people towards holding the old ancestor of Castle Peak and others, towards the room.
<br><br>Looking at the back of Old Ancestor Qingshan and the others leaving, Ye Bei raised the corners of his mouth leisurely.
<br><br>He Ye Bei was able to achieve Martial Emperor at the age of 30, and was the leader of the Explosive Sky Gang, not simply rely on talent.
<br><br>The reliance is this, know how to improvise the mind.
<br><br>The one who knows the time is a good man!
<br><br>This is a saying that he firmly believes in.
<br><br>"Gang master, this is the information of Lu Qingshan, Zhu Yun, and the many elders of the Qingshan Sect, the aptitudes, hobbies, and personalities are all recorded." At this time, an elder swept up beside Ye Bei and took out a piece of information.
<br><br>Ye Bei flipped through the information and raised the corner of his mouth, "Very good, I don't need to teach you what to do next, right?"
<br><br>"I know."
<br><br>The elder nodded, but before leaving, he hesitated, "But gang master, it's just a small Castle Peak Sect, is it necessary for us to treat it so solemnly?"
<br><br>Hearing that, Ye Bei's face sank.
<br><br>Took a deep breath before saying with extra solemnity: "It is very necessary ......"
<br><br>"Because, he is our Explosive Sky Gang's, life-saving straw!"
