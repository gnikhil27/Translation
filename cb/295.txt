When the sound of the zither entered his ears, Meng Li Xian, who was leaving in anger, was stunned.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>"This is actually the power of the Great Dao!"
<br><br>She stared at her eyes, and her body couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>Incredulity shone in her eyes.
<br><br>She, Meng Lixian, was known for her zither skills in this chaotic land, and even had the title of Lixian Zither Emperor, so when the sound of the zither entered her ears, she instantly perceived that the sound of the zither was interspersed with the power of the Great Dao.
<br><br>The power of the Great Dao.
<br><br>It is something that all Martial Emperors dream of.
<br><br>Because to the martial emperor, want to continue to improve, you need to choose a path of their own, only follow this path all the way up, there is the possibility of breaking the immortal.
<br><br>Although now the immortal road has been broken, but less than that critical point, the crowd will still have a heart to pursue.
<br><br>Although most people will still choose martial arts cultivation, but according to different talents, there will still be people looking for other paths, such as the qin for cultivation, to calligraphy and painting for cultivation ...... Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And no matter what kind of cultivation, to the level of the martial emperor want to improve, are inseparable from the comprehension of the power of the great dao.
<br><br>If you can not comprehend enough power of the great dao, simply can not break through the current realm.
<br><br>But the power of the great dao which is so easy to comprehend, but can comprehend a little bit, is a great opportunity.
<br><br>However, the shocking thing of directly revealing the power of the Great Dao on the surface, directly intermingled with the sound of the zither, was simply unheard of and unseen by Meng Li Xian.
<br><br>In short, it was completely beyond the scope of her mind.
<br><br>Her mouth drew a cold breath backwards.
<br><br>If she were to compare the power of the Great Dao that she had comprehended with this one who played the zither, it was a complete drop in the ocean.
<br><br>She simply couldn't imagine how there could be such a high level person in this Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>What made her even more unbelievable was that the sound of the zither was coming from the inner courtyard she had just left.
<br><br>She knew nothing about the Desolate Pathless.
<br><br>As for that old man Yin Shengfu, it goes without saying.
<br><br>Therefore, the person who played the zither was almost a cry for help ......
<br><br>She stumbled on her feet, her face turned extremely pale, and instantly understood that her short-sightedness had caused trouble.
<br><br>What Desolate Pathless said is true.
<br><br>To be able to have this kind of tactics, at least an immortal!
<br><br>However, at this moment, she could not think about so much, opened her ears and listened carefully to the sound of the zither, feeling the power of the great dao in the sound of the zither, because the power of the great dao was too important to her.
<br><br>However, because the distance was too far, the sound of the zither became indistinct when it reached here.
<br><br>Thinking of this, her body hurriedly moved, turned back and hurried back towards the inner courtyard.
<br><br>In the inner courtyard.
<br><br>Desolate pathless was also instantly stunned.
<br><br>Because he also clearly really felt the power of the great dao in the sound of the zither, just let him helplessly, this unique power of the zither dao to him except for the state of mind has a lot of effect, not much else.
<br><br>And Yin Shengfu, who had been resting his eyes closed and uninterested in all this, also opened his eyes and gave Yi Feng a slightly surprised look.
<br><br>But soon, closed his eyes again, completely ignoring everything around him.
<br><br>And at this moment, Meng Li Xian, also finally rushed back to the inner courtyard.
<br><br>The sound of the zither was finally clear and incomparable at this moment, and it came to her ears, instantly putting her into a state.
<br><br>Especially the strong power of the great dao, mixed in the sound of the zither is simply pounding.
<br><br>This made her so excited that her body couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>Because she had been stuck at a certain critical point, but this last step she could not break through for a long time.
<br><br>And the power of the Great Dao in front of her was just like the key to her breakthrough.
<br><br>"Almost there."
<br><br>"Almost there, just a hair short of ......"
<br><br>Meng Li Xian's fists couldn't help but clench up, her heart secretly expecting this moment to finally be coming.
<br><br>But just at this moment.
<br><br>The sound of the zither stopped abruptly.
<br><br>Meng Lixian, who was at the final hurdle, was instantly dumbfounded and woke up with a start, shouting with a pale face, "Why did it stop?"
<br><br>She had just subconsciously transmitted her voice when she met Yi Feng's meaningful gaze.
<br><br>"Want to listen?"
<br><br>"I won't let you listen!"
<br><br>Yi Feng coldly snorted, and with his palms behind his back, he got up and returned to the wine table.
<br><br>Just now this woman ran back that look, Yi Feng captured that this woman should also be a person who loves the piano.
<br><br>The woman's face is so beautiful.
<br><br>Since you love to listen, then I will not let you listen, to disgust you.
<br><br>After all, he did not forget, just now this woman to him is how the mouth.
<br><br>The words in the line are a look down on him.
<br><br>Who the hell says men don't hold grudges?
<br><br>I'll remember.
<br><br>You do not give me a good face, do not expect me to give you a good face.
<br><br>Even in the face of the Arable Trail, Yi Feng also thought so, after all, this woman showed his face to him, did not look at the face of the Arable Trail ah.
