"Mmm!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded lightly.
<br><br>Anyway, it was all drinking and bragging criticism, and did not care whether they believed it or not.
<br><br>But he did not know that his words made their hearts and minds tremble, and the fervor and respect in their eyes climbed to the extreme.
<br><br>Since they had known Yi Feng for so long, they had never really confirmed what his cultivation level was, and he himself had never revealed any information about his cultivation level.
<br><br>In addition, they did not dare to ask, so they have been able to rely on some of the means that Yi Feng has demonstrated, to guess Yi Feng's cultivation.
<br><br>And today.
<br><br>Yi Feng is finally revealed a little, about his cultivation clues!
<br><br>Immortal!
<br><br>Immortal without a doubt.
<br><br>Although previously guessed, but is only a guess, and this time is considered ironclad evidence. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because they are sure that even the strongest Martial Emperor of the Immortal River Continent can never do across the world, I am afraid that only this kind of upper world, the legendary Immortal can do it.
<br><br>Can't help but, they have more respect for Yi Feng, the heart is also doubly proud.
<br><br>From the heart rose a strong sense of glory.
<br><br>And this glory, not only their own, and even the future of their descendants traveling the continent, also be able to say a chest, think back to the old ancestors of my family but to immortal work, together with a meal.
<br><br>It is simply a glorious ancestor!
<br><br>"I said another world, what are you guys excited about?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave them a white glance.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd lowered their heads with parched faces, revealing an embarrassed look.
<br><br>Even though such a heavenly means of crossing worlds seemed trivial to the seniors, it was still hard to suppress the shock in their hearts when they heard it.
<br><br>"Sir, you continue."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, sir can you tell us a little bit about what kind of world that is?"
<br><br>"Tell the story of that world."
<br><br>Then, they asked towards Yi Feng with expectant faces.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head, distantly remembered the things of his previous life, his heart could not help but be moved, after so many years, still can not let go ah!
<br><br>So be it!
<br><br>Let it be a story for them to hear, anyway, drink too much to blow off steam!
<br><br>"That is another civilization, the people of that world are also very smart and powerful, they make things really take out, destroy the immortal river continent is also easy, even, can make the entire continent of all life extinct!"
<br><br>"Shiver!"
<br><br>Hearing this, Wu Yonghong and the others immediately shivered.
<br><br>Looking at each other's eyes, they saw the shock in each other's gaze.
<br><br>Such a gesture was terrifying as hell.
<br><br>The Immortal River Continent was so big, and no one had ever heard of anyone being able to destroy the entire continent, let alone make all life extinct.
<br><br>"Then sir, in that world, at what level?" Wu Yonghong asked cautiously.
<br><br>"Me, huh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said, "Barely an average level, but of course in front of that kind of real big brother, only a bottom level!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Bottom tier?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, almost did not speak them stunned faint.
<br><br>Strong as Mr., the exiled immortal general character, actually in that world can only barely be considered an average level?
<br><br>Then, how powerful were the people in that world?
<br><br>Could it be that everyone was an immortal?
<br><br>The thought of this, they drew a cold breath backwards, instantly felt their own insignificance, if they people run to that world, would not they be slag-like existence?
<br><br>"Then sir there, any other stories of your own?" After a shock, Lu Qingshan could not help but ask again.
<br><br>"Seven or eight stories of course, such as then young and frivolous, with a few of their own looks foot in a few boats, while and several thousands of miles away from the girl chat involved." Yi Feng laughed rather self-deprecatingly.
<br><br>"At the same time and several thousand miles away from the girl chat involved?"
<br><br>At these words, Wu Yonghong's eyes once again glared.
<br><br>Although a thousand miles for them is not too far, just across a Pingjiang City, but also need an incense burning time ah, but Yi Feng and several thousand miles away and different places at the same time the girl ......
<br><br>What the hell does this mean?
<br><br>Twist the space?
<br><br>"At the same time and several girls, this kind of means, Mr. really terrifying as ah!" Several people could not help but exclaim.
<br><br>"What's so scary about it, in that world it's just a base fuck!" Yi Feng gave them a blank look and said speechlessly, it's just a matter of a cell phone.
<br><br>Only he did not explain too much, otherwise the nonsense up again is endless.
<br><br>But Wu Yonghong and other people are shocked beyond belief.
<br><br>This means is actually just base manipulation, then it seems that they guessed that world per capita is the fact of immortality, that seems to be undoubtedly.
<br><br>"Speaking of which, I was kind of a slag at the time!"
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up a glass of wine, smiled self-deprecatingly, with all the nostalgia for that world in his eyes. And why take out this kind of embarrassment at the time to say, is also considered to the lost eighteen years, and youth nostalgia it!
<br><br>Especially that hold the phone all night waiting for news, that stare at the circle of friends to speculate on each other's thoughts, that to the classroom sleepy-eyed when ......
<br><br>The slag is slag, but who says it is not youth?
<br><br>"Scum is?"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong and others could not help but ask again.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at them, this group of old men is really a hundred thousand reasons, said rather mockingly: "You just take it as a compliment!"
<br><br>"So that's how it is, that gentleman is indeed a slag without a doubt!"
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people newly learned a term, so they could not help but take out the praise.
<br><br>Smell, Yi Feng a dark face, the face muscles can not help but twitch.
<br><br>Really lift a stone to smash their own feet!
<br><br>Day.
<br><br>Gradually darkened.
<br><br>Wine.
<br><br>Continue to drink.
<br><br>Bull.
<br><br>Also continue to blow.
<br><br>Just gradually ......
<br><br>Some people do not win the wine, Wu Yonghong and Lu Qingshan at some point collapsed under the table, one holding a leg table with a snore.
<br><br>And Sun Zhuge and Chu wild lion is cross lying on the ground, especially Sun Zhuge also hold Chu wild lion's feet, while squirming mouth, but also from time to time sniffed.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Lightly sighed, slightly drunk Yi Feng looked up at the bright moon and drank a pot of cloudy wine alone.
<br><br>Picked up his guitar and sat on the roof.
<br><br>"When is the bright moon, ask the sky with wine, I don't know the palace in the sky, what year is this ......"
<br><br>The strings are gently plucked, accompanied by the sound of the guitar, the melodious voice gently hummed out.
