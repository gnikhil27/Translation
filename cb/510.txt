"The number of Heavenly Determination has actually increased."
<br><br>"Oh my god, how could the number of heavenly determinations increase so much at once in a short period of time."
<br><br>Perdition felt like his brain was going to explode.
<br><br>He had to know that the last time he was given the information about the Number of Heavenly Determination, just ten years ago, there were only two hundred and thirty-four digits.
<br><br>And these two hundred and thirty-four, are after many eras of accumulation, by the reincarnation, reborn, and so on various identities of people, perhaps they are not strong now, but they are more than ordinary people, the body inherited a distinctive qi and future.
<br><br>It can be said that these people are the true pride of the sky and the favorites of the heavens.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It took many epochs to accumulate two hundred and thirty-four people, but now that ten years have passed, this number has instantly climbed to more than three hundred people.
<br><br>This is the same as saying that this kind of heaven's pride has increased by more than sixty in just ten years.
<br><br>What the hell kind of concept is this?
<br><br>But what made his scalp tingle even more was that this number did not stop at three hundred. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But then climbed at an even faster rate.
<br><br>Three hundred, five hundred, one thousand ......
<br><br>Two thousand, three thousand, four thousand ......
<br><br>Until finally, break ten thousand!
<br><br>The world of extermination has long been staring at the eyes, the heart shocked already do not know what to use to describe.
<br><br>Until the end, the world of extermination has been completely numb.
<br><br>And after the number broke ten thousand, it was still rising like crazy.
<br><br>Fifteen thousand, twenty thousand, twenty-five thousand ......
<br><br>Until finally, fixed at the number of ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety, only then did it stop.
<br><br>Perishable felt weak in both legs.
<br><br>The body was trembling.
<br><br>He finally understood why that one had to re-tell him the number of heavenly determination through the power of astrology.
<br><br>There was actually such a monstrous change.
<br><br>Chaos.
<br><br>Chaos.
<br><br>Everything was in chaos.
<br><br>It was a complete mess.
<br><br>The accumulation of many eras was only two hundred and thirty-four heavenly determiners.
<br><br>Then nearly ten years directly up to the number of nearly one hundred thousand.
<br><br>This kind of thing was completely beyond the scope of his mind.
<br><br>The existence of one Heavenly Determinator can cause a certain turmoil in the continent.
<br><br>One hundred thousand of them in the same era, one could imagine what kind of earth-shattering friction would be caused.
<br><br>"Friction?"
<br><br>"It does not exist."
<br><br>"The island is all family, there can't be a big friction in this life!"
<br><br>While fishing and chatting, talking about this worry of Lu Qingshan, Yi Feng just laughed.
<br><br>Looked at the sky, the fish catch is quite bountiful he got up and stretched, then said, "Go back, it's getting late."
<br><br>"Yes, sir."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan picked up the fish basket and followed behind him with a faint heart.
<br><br>Back at the Heaven and Earth Gate, Yi Feng, who was in a good mood, inexplicably felt annoyed.
<br><br>Nowadays, he was feeling more and more dissatisfied with these disciples.
<br><br>The last time they gathered to teach them a lesson, I thought they would be restrained for a few days, at least do a diligent look to him.
<br><br>But they were getting more and more fucking excessive.
<br><br>Before at least can still see someone walking, but now well, 24 hours a day not see a person, are staying in the library do nothing, all the fucking catch novels and comics.
<br><br>Simply does not put him in the eyes of this master ah!
<br><br>Pissed me off too.
<br><br>"Old Qing, gather them."
<br><br>Yi Feng face gloomy voice.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Immediately, Qing Huanxiang's voice spread throughout the entire Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>In the Book Depository, all the people raised their heads.
<br><br>"Quick, quick, quick, the master is calling us!"
<br><br>"Yes, it's time to see the Master again."
<br><br>"I just don't know what instructions the Master has this time!"
<br><br>In a short while, dozens of disciples gathered in the square, waiting for Yi Feng's lecture.
<br><br>As soon as he saw this group of wastes who were muddling through, Yi Feng scolded.
<br><br>"You say you bunch of losers, is it interesting to cower inside the Book Collection Pavilion all day?"
<br><br>"Look, what kind of slovenly have you become."
<br><br>"And you, you've turned into a dead fatty."
<br><br>"Can't you go out for a walk?"
<br><br>"Is the lady outside unattractive, or is the air outside not fresh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lectured with a stern face, "But if you guys go out for a walk and find something to do, isn't it better than hunkering down in that scripture collection?"
<br><br>"Finally, just one word to you, from today onwards, whoever lets me see you all day again looking like you're waiting for death, get the hell out of here."
<br><br>Yi Feng turned around and left with an iron face.
<br><br>Want to wait for death in the Heaven and Earth Sect and glean his wool?
<br><br>No way!
<br><br>And after Yi Feng left, the disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect talked a lot.
<br><br>"Master, Master, what does he mean by this?"
<br><br>"Yes, Master is not usually so strict, why is he so strict today!"
<br><br>One by one, they speculated with solemn faces.
<br><br>"Master brothers, I see that what the master said is not wrong, we should go out for a walk." At this time, Su Yun Yun said as she walked out.
<br><br>"Wow, Senior Sister, does Master really mean that?" The crowd turned their gazes to Su Yun Yun and asked, "But Master wants us to go out, what for?"
<br><br>"Didn't Master say it's obvious?"
<br><br>"To find something to do."
<br><br>"Of course it's to find something to do!"
<br><br>Su Yunyun said meaningfully.
<br><br>At those words, the crowd's eyes lit up and instantly reacted.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>As disciples of their master, disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect, how could they stay within the mountain gate all day long?
<br><br>Naturally, they had to shine brightly on the continent, and even trample the whole continent under their feet.
