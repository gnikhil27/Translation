"Sir?"
<br><br>"What sir?"
<br><br>For a moment, the crowd did not react.
<br><br>But a moment later, they snapped awake!
<br><br>"The gentleman you are talking about, is it that one?"
<br><br>The crowd coincidentally turned their gazes towards the two Yun Xian Que, filled with tension.
<br><br>They knew in their hearts what this one represented, and the reason most of them were here was because of this one.
<br><br>And Li Yihan, who was on the side, also had a fierce tightening in his heart.
<br><br>"Not bad, it is exactly that gentleman!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que and Fifth Longkong nodded solemnly, their gazes filled with reverence and fervor.
<br><br>"Phew!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After receiving the confirmation from the two, the whole room was in an uproar.
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder someone was so bold, actually able to sleep leisurely under such circumstances.
<br><br>It turned out to be this supreme person.
<br><br>Finally understand what is called art high people bold.
<br><br>And also finally understand.
<br><br>Why they Nansha, suddenly appeared such as skeleton Ben Wei, pork Rong and so a large group of super strong people.
<br><br>The original.
<br><br>They are all the people brought by that super expert.
<br><br>In this way, that makes sense.
<br><br>For a while, the crowd was filled with fervor and anticipation for that sleeping figure.
<br><br>The subordinates were all so strong, and they didn't put emperor-level battles in their sights at all, so how terrifying should his own strength be?
<br><br>But aside.
<br><br>Li Yihan heard this news, shocked fiercely stepped in mid-air backwards a few steps, behind accidentally hit a person stopped, only to let the whole person slightly slowed down.
<br><br>Because this news caused a much bigger shock to her than others.
<br><br>In other words, the young man who sat in the carriage with her and spent many days together was the very same super person who was rumored by those cultivators!
<br><br>Thinking of this, Li Yihan's body shivered, just felt unable to breathe.
<br><br>This information hit her mind!
<br><br>Thinking back to this journey, especially when she was in front of Yi Feng, a small Martial King shouting and even pointing at the mountains, she just felt her scalp tingling and wanted to find a crack in the ground to burrow down.
<br><br>At the same time, her mind is also filled with a strong fear, afraid that these big shots looking for her to settle scores after the fall.
<br><br>However, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu were equally shocked than others.
<br><br>Because they were surprised to find that this big man, but is not the one they met in the Shifu Mountain Range?
<br><br>And wasn't the black-robed person who was ravaging the giant jiao at this moment the same one who had kicked Song Ke's doppelganger over?
<br><br>"Little reptile, you are too weak, this scum has no interest in playing with you."
<br><br>In the sky, Bone Ben Wei slapped his palm on the giant jiao's head.
<br><br>"Ouch ......"
<br><br>Along with a shocking hissing sound, the huge body of the giant auger smashed to the ground, killing him directly.
<br><br>What made them even more shocked was that this slap from Bone Ben Wei directly knocked the giant auger back to its original form, turning it into a two meter long snake lying straight on the ground.
<br><br>This hand is really too appalling.
<br><br>To do all this, only when that palm fell, directly scattered hundreds of thousands of years of cultivation of the giant auger.
<br><br>Things.
<br><br>Finally, it was the end of the story.
<br><br>"Let's hurry up and pay our respects to the senior, hurry up and ask that senior to give us a chance!"
<br><br>"Haha, yes, I can't wait to pay my respects to that supreme senior, and the chance will definitely be mine."
<br><br>"But what if that high person doesn't give the chance?"
<br><br>"How is that possible? We have come a long way to receive him, so it would be too much to say that he won't give us the chance!"
<br><br>"Right, right, this master is so powerful, the chance must be for everyone!"
<br><br>The crowd said urgently.
<br><br>They scrambled and were about to fly towards where Yi Feng was.
<br><br>But however, Pork Rong and the others suddenly stopped them, revealing their might to shake them away in unison.
<br><br>Then, an icy cold voice came out from Wu Yonghong's mouth, "What are you guys, you are also worthy of disturbing sir's sleep and asking for a chance?"
<br><br>"Senior, you can't say that, he came to our Nansha, there must be something to show!"
<br><br>"Yeah, yeah, can't take the enthusiasm of us people in vain!"
