"Shut up!"
<br><br>Looking at the faces of these people, as if Mr. owed them, Pork Rong became full of anger.
<br><br>"Where did you guys get the face to be so self-absorbed?"
<br><br>"And since when did sir need you bunch of trash to receive him?"
<br><br>"You are also worthy?"
<br><br>The Martial Emperor's aura was suddenly revealed, shocking them into shutting their mouths instantly.
<br><br>"One more warning for you today!"
<br><br>Porky Rong's voice came out again.
<br><br>
<br><br>"So Mr. Ying ordered that from today, we do not allow any cultivator, any clan and the cultivation of things that appear in his sight."
<br><br>"And if anyone violates it and destroys Mr. Experience mortal life, no matter what it is, the six of us will personally ......" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Destroy it!"
<br><br>Said, pork rong palm raised, before a few shameless want chance cultivator's body exploded, turned into blood rain floating down.
<br><br>"Roll!"
<br><br>Pork Rong bellowed.
<br><br>The crowd trembled with fear, no longer daring to ask for any chance, and retreated one after another.
<br><br>"Miss Li."
<br><br>But Li Yihan just flew out not far, behind him came the voice of Grand Master Wang.
<br><br>Li Yihan's body trembled, and he quickly looked over nervously.
<br><br>"Didn't you say you would stay with us for a few more days, if you suddenly leave, we won't be able to give an account there at sir." Grand Master Wang said with a smile.
<br><br>Li Yihan face became white, full of death, this is to settle accounts after the autumn?
<br><br>Seeing this, Grand Master Wang smiled and said, "Miss Li, you don't have to worry, we and Mr. are only mortals, we won't do anything to you."
<br><br>"Mortals ......"
<br><br>Hearing these words, Li Yihan felt inexplicably complicated, but her heart was also slightly relieved, which followed with apprehension.
<br><br>A night passed.
<br><br>The red sun slowly rose, and it was another good day.
<br><br>Pork Rong and others who were sitting cross-legged opened their eyes and took a look at the north.
<br><br>There, many cultivators gathered, but a few miles away, did not dare to come.
<br><br>Several people also did not care anymore.
<br><br>As long as they do not disturb Mr. experience mortal life, these people they do not put in their eyes.
<br><br>On the side, Li Yihan cautiously glanced at these people.
<br><br>This night, it can be said to be spent in fear.
<br><br>Just then, another petunia suddenly stretched out in front of her.
<br><br>"Auntie, there is no interest in accompanying oh, look at the sunrise ah ......" skeleton Ben Wei held a flower in one hand, one hand propped on the tree next to it, the right foot crossed the left foot carelessly tap on the ground, emitting a teasing voice.
<br><br>Li Yihan face astonished, fiercely stood up.
<br><br>"Former ...... senior, do not dare to do so, I I, what virtue I have, how can I be worthy of you ......"
<br><br>Li Yihan said in a panic.
<br><br>If not after that scene last night, she certainly would not give a good face, but remembering that this one directly beat the emperor-level giant auger into its original form, she could not easily manage to face this one indifferently.
<br><br>"What's not worthy, is it that this slag has not tired of conquering last night's majestic drops?" Skeleton Ben Wei puffed out his chest and said with his head held high.
<br><br>"No ...... no not."
<br><br>Li Yihan explained in a panic, for a time did not know what to do.
<br><br>However, at this moment, a sudden kick flew over, kicking the self-proclaimed dashing Bones Ben Wei to the ground.
<br><br>"Dog!"
<br><br>It was Yi Feng, who had just woken up, who saw this scene before he had time to wake up from his sleep.
<br><br>But this scene almost made Li Yihan's heart jump out in shock.
<br><br>"Miss Li, are you all right?" Yi Feng asked apologetically.
<br><br>"I ...... me me me, it's fine." Li Yihan stammered in reply.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>Look, this broken skeleton will be people girls scared into what, people are still cultivators.
<br><br>In anger, Yi Feng picked up a stone and chased after Bone Ben Wei, until Bone Ben Wei jumped to his feet and ran out of sight, Yi Feng rushed back to the camp in a huff.
<br><br>"Yo?"
<br><br>"What a big snake."
<br><br>When he came back, Yi Feng immediately found a dead snake on the ground, his eyes immediately emerged light.
<br><br>"Hey hey sir, at your command, got it last night."
<br><br>Old man Wang said with a smile.
<br><br>"Good guy, I told you this place must have good wild game!" Yi Feng immediately lifted up his sleeves, and began to pack, while saying: "These days the mouth is almost light out of a bird, this morning on the snake soup, as the saying goes, breakfast to eat well, Chinese food to eat full, dinner to eat less."
<br><br>One side.
<br><br>Li Yihan body trembled violently, red lips could not help but open.
<br><br>Eat ......
<br><br>Eat eat eat, demon emperor?
<br><br>On the side, Master Wang came with a smile and patted her shoulder, smiling: "Calm down, just get used to it."
<br><br>Just get used to it ......
<br><br>Li Yihan teeth straight shiver.
<br><br>"Which one of you go to seek some firewood ah?" At this time, Yi Feng shouted.
<br><br>"I'll go."
<br><br>Li Yihan hurriedly stood up and said, in front of these people, she sat like a needle every moment, and this kind of miscellaneous things, she naturally did not dare to let others to do.
<br><br>"Okay, then Miss Li will trouble you, dog you go with Miss Li, or have a lookout." Yi Feng instructed.
<br><br>"Ow ......"
<br><br>The dog barked and followed Li Yihan.
<br><br>One person and one dog walked towards the forest not far away, leaving the range of sight of Yi Feng and others, Li Yihan was relieved.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"It's too hard to be in the presence of these experts."
<br><br>Saying that, Li Yihan turned her gaze to Ao Qing, squatted down and stroked Ao Qing's fur with her jade hand, and said softly, "Only in front of you can make it easier for me."
<br><br>PS: Four more to.
