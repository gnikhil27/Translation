"What's wrong with you two?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"No, no, no, accidentally fell, sir you guys continue to chat, continue to chat."
<br><br>The father and son said sheepishly, then took the opportunity to run into the dense forest in the distance.
<br><br>"Damn, which son of a bitch is it, is this going to kill me?"
<br><br>Fifth Tianming wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and instructed his son, "Immediately send a voice back to the clan, find out who this is for me, immediately sever all ties and expel him from the mountain."
<br><br>By the time the fifth Tianming father and son returned, Yun Sheng had already departed.
<br><br>This Yi Feng also has no way, although for the sake of his disciple's happiness, let the cloud family in danger is quite selfish, but since Yun Sheng also have this will, Yi Feng is always impossible to send him back in.
<br><br>Ye family.
<br><br>A stream of light swept in and landed at the gate of the Ye family.
<br><br>"Brother!"
<br><br>"Son!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"You've finally returned."
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Wuchen's father and son both hurriedly greeted him.
<br><br>The one who came back was none other than Ye Tianzhi, who had received the news. His icy face was bubbling with cold air as he asked in a deep voice, "What is going on?"
<br><br>"Brother, there are some people who robbed your brother's woman, among them there is also a martial spirit, and they also injured father, you must do something for us!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen cried and complained towards Ye Tianzhi.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, must take revenge for us!"
<br><br>Ye Huai's voice likewise came out.
<br><br>Obviously, even Ye Huai, who was the head of the family, treated Ye Tianzhi as the main backbone.
<br><br>Who told this son of his family to be so outstanding.
<br><br>"How dare you move the earth on Taiyang's head, are you not putting me, Ye Tianzhi, in your eyes?"
<br><br>A faint coldness flowed from Ye Tianzhi's body, and a voice full of killing intent came out.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, according to the time, they should not have left the range of Hanchang yet, and because of our special geographical location of Hanchang, so if they want to leave, they have to cross the First Line Valley, we quickly dare to rush, we can definitely block them." At this point, Ye Wuchen hurriedly said, "Now we are waiting for you to nod and act."
<br><br>"Right, there is also the Yun family, the Yun family definitely can't get away with it." Ye Wuchen added.
<br><br>"The tiny Yun family, do they not want to stay in Hanchang City anymore?"
<br><br>Ye Tianzhi sent out a sinister voice and ordered, "Father, I will take Wuduan to chase them on my side, surround the Yun Family on your side first, after I chase that group of people back, then we will destroy the Yun Family together."
<br><br>"Good, good."
<br><br>At those words, excited voices came from Ye Wuchen and Ye Huai.
<br><br>Riding on the night, Ye Tianzhi brought Ye Wuchen to the First Line Canyon to keep watch.
<br><br>"Don't worry brother, although they have martial spirits, the others are not very strong, at most a little stronger than those warriors of our family." In the dark, Ye Wuchen said towards Ye Tianzhi.
<br><br>"Where did such a group of ants get the guts to provoke my Ye family?" Ye Tianzhi said with a cold face.
<br><br>"Yes, this group of farts has too much guts." Ye Wuchen responded.
<br><br>"Don't worry, none of them will be able to escape."
<br><br>Ye Tianzhi's Martial King strength slowly revealed itself, with a look of confidence on his face.
<br><br>"Wow, big brother, you have already broken through Martial King?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Wuchen's face was filled with a look of surprise.
<br><br>Humph.
<br><br>With my big brother here, whatever Martial Spirit or whatever you are, all of you will die.
<br><br>I want you damn fart people to kneel on the ground and lick my shoes.
<br><br>By the way.
<br><br>There is also that skeleton, although Ye Wuchen does not know what that is a thing, but in his heart has secretly vowed, no matter it is a dead spirit or something, later on, he will press him on the ground fiercely, hold the revenge of that foot.
<br><br>Of course, there is also that guy dressed as a woman, corrupting the reputation of this duke not to mention, but also smashed people with meat buns.
<br><br>This group of people have a count one, all must die.
<br><br>Soon after.
<br><br>Through the faint fog, you can faintly see below the canyon, a team slowly coming this way.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Wuchen's eyes lit up in his heart and looked nervously at the pair.
<br><br>When they got closer, his face instantly revealed a wildly joyful look.
<br><br>"Ahahaha, it's them, it's really them!"
<br><br>"Big brother, they're coming, to make sure nothing goes wrong, when they get closer and there's no way back, you can make your move."
<br><br>Ye Wuchen immediately emitted an urgent voice and clenched his fist tightly.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>He had even seen this group of people kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy towards him after being crippled by his big brother, their faces full of remorse.
<br><br>He had also already thought about how to dispose of these people one by one in a while ......
<br><br>The more you think about it.
<br><br>He became more and more pleased.
<br><br>Finally, Ye Wuchen excitedly shouted, "Big brother, the time has come, hurry up and do it."
<br><br>But after waiting for a while, the Ye Tianzhi behind him did not move half as much.
<br><br>What was going on here?
<br><br>"Brother, it's time to make a move."
<br><br>He shouted again.
<br><br>But behind him, there was not even a single echo.
<br><br>He looked behind him with a puzzled gaze, and instantly found that Ye Tianzhi was gone.
<br><br>"What's wrong?"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen, who was full of complacency, was suddenly frozen in place, confused ......
