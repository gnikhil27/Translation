"Your Honor, Patriarch, Li Family Master, the disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect and Li Family have already withdrawn from the mountain range." A Martial Exalt reported towards Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Crisis.
<br><br>Finally, it was relieved.
<br><br>Although Song Ke was the king of the mountain and powerful, he was not so powerful as to go to Nansha to attack them.
<br><br>If such a big demon as Song Ke really run to the Nansha nonsense, that may really cause the two tribes war.
<br><br>"Then two, what do we do next, also retreat?" One of the Martial Dignitaries asked.
<br><br>At these words, Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu glanced at each other and nodded their heads in unison in tacit agreement.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>They were not willing to leave just like that.
<br><br>That incense bag was an emperor grade or even higher grade treasure, but if there was even a slight chance to snatch it back, they didn't want to give up. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>What's more, at this moment they are all left behind are martial experts, move to a lot less worry, want to leave is also relatively easy.
<br><br>Of course, the most important thing is that the terrifying black-robed man stepped on Song Ke's doppelganger, although it will not bring a fatal threat to Song Ke himself, but will also bring some trauma to his soul, will certainly make him break the day of the saint, postponed a lot.
<br><br>And this period of time was the greatest opportunity for them.
<br><br>"Go!"
<br><br>A group of a dozen Martial Sovereign experts swept out into the air.
<br><br>Soon, the group arrived silently above a canyon.
<br><br>In the canyon below, the crowd could see that there were countless lush sky-high trees, and under such dense vegetation coverage, the sky was covered, and not a single ray of sunlight could shine down.
<br><br>And in the center of the countless vegetation, there is a most sturdy acacia tree!
<br><br>And it.
<br><br>It was Song Ke's original body.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, Song Ke is in the period of breaking the saint, many means can not be exerted out, we go down to seize the incense bag immediately leave." Li Shuhua looked down and sent out a voice.
<br><br>"Remember, don't get attached to the battle." Yang Tianyu added.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>But just as they were about to make a move, the faces of all the people present changed violently.
<br><br>"What's going on, why is my strength a few points weaker?"
<br><br>"Yes, I also have this symptom."
<br><br>"Poison, poison in the body, hurry up and run the Yuan Qi to force out the toxins in the body." Li Shuhua hurriedly shouted, and himself also used Yuan Qi to start forcing out the toxin.
<br><br>Although this toxin is not fatal, the suppression of their cultivation is only 30% or 40%, but at this moment such a change, obviously not a good thing.
<br><br>Just as the crowd was wondering, one of them suddenly stepped out, emitting a cold laugh.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I didn't expect to be discovered by you guys in advance!"
<br><br>"The Dark Night Demonfather, is that you?"
<br><br>The crowd looked their eyes towards the one who was laughing coldly and questioned in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Not bad, it's me, you guys still trust me too much, unknowingly being poisoned by me without even knowing it, how ridiculous!" Dark Night sneered coldly.
<br><br>"You, damn you!"
<br><br>"You traitor."
<br><br>"Although you are a demonic beast, my Royal Sword Sect has treated you not badly all these years, how dare you betray!"
<br><br>Yang Tianyu cursed out loud, never expecting to be shaded by one of his own.
<br><br>Although the dark night is a demon, but he never suspected, after all, the development of a sect can not be separated from a strong battle force to join, and to the realm of the demon can be completely human, the appearance and human is no different, plus the dark night is indeed sincere surrender, this kind of battle force they naturally will not refuse.
<br><br>But did not expect, human and demon is not the same after all!
<br><br>"Hmph, what are you talking about, prepare to wait for death!"
<br><br>Dark Night sneered, and did not want to talk more with the crowd, but kneeled down towards the canyon and respectfully said, "Sen Ancestor, this group of human strength is only five or six left, please Sen Ancestor send someone to do it!"
<br><br>"Hm!"
<br><br>An echoing voice echoed through the canyon.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, a dozen Demon Ancestors abruptly flew up and transformed into their original bodies, coming towards Yang Tianyu and the others with murderous intent.
<br><br>"Retreat!"
<br><br>Li Shuhua shouted.
<br><br>The others also understood the seriousness of the matter, with everyone's battle power weakened by thirty to forty percent, there would not be the slightest advantage in fighting, and it would be impossible to get the fragrance bag again under such circumstances.
<br><br>Li Shuhua and the others swept out into the air.
<br><br>"Humph, where to escape!"
<br><br>Numerous demon dignitaries followed in succession, chasing towards Li Shuhua and the others.
<br><br>The situation was not good for Li Shuhua and the others, the difference in cultivation between the two sides was not much, and under the situation of being suppressed by 30% to 40% of cultivation, they were soon caught up by the demon dweller.
<br><br>Under this situation, Li Shuhua and others had to be forced to fight.
<br><br>For a time, a dozen martial and demon dwellers started a stunning battle.
<br><br>At the beginning, Li Shuhua and others were able to fight with them using many means and cards, but over time, under the influence of toxins, they gradually fell into a disadvantage.
<br><br>In particular, the way these demon dwellers transformed into their origin essence to fight brought them heavy pressure, this origin essence, although about the same size as other beasts of the same species body, but flexible and powerful, a time to fight the crowd defeated.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Finally, one human martial dweller fell.
<br><br>And with the defeat of this martial dweller, it snowballed, and at the back, some of the human martial dweller had to fight one against two or even one against three when their own cultivation was suppressed.
<br><br>Finally, after most of the day's entanglement, including Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu were heavily wounded and surrounded by many demon dzong.
<br><br>"Children, well done."
<br><br>At this time, a human face coalesced above a peculiar plant with giant thorns growing next to it, as tall as a person, and a voice came out.
<br><br>Obviously, this is again Song Ke split out his intention to attach to this plant, and coalesce the doppelganger.
<br><br>"Greetings, Ancestor Sen!"
<br><br>The demon ancestors paid their respects.
<br><br>"Well, remove these humans, completely!"
<br><br>The face on the tree trunk commanded, then closed its eyes and waited for the final result.
<br><br>"Humans, kneel down, maybe we can still leave your body whole!"
<br><br>"That's right, if you kneel down and stick your heads out yourselves, maybe it will make your death more comfortable, otherwise, we'll scrap your cultivation and take it to feed our children."
<br><br>"Jie Jie ......"
<br><br>The crowd of demon dignitaries surrounded Li Shuhua and the others, slowly approaching, while a teasing voice came out.
<br><br>"Humph, you guys don't rejoice too early."
<br><br>Yang Tianyu shouted with an iron face.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>"To still dare to talk tough even now, humans are really ridiculous!"
<br><br>A lion-shaped demon djinn emitted a cold laughing voice.
<br><br>"To tell you the truth, no one can save you today ......"
<br><br>But at this moment.
<br><br>A change suddenly happened!
<br><br>A little boy suddenly jumped out from behind him.
<br><br>"Chop!"
<br><br>The voice fell, and a slash of sword light fell down.
<br><br>The look on this lion-shaped demon djinn's face froze abruptly, and then his body split in half and fell directly to the ground.
<br><br>Before the crowd could react to what had happened, they saw a youth appear behind the little boy, excitedly pointing at the many demon dzong and shouting out.
<br><br>"Ahahaha, disciple, the opportunity to practice is here, there are still a dozen beasts here, quickly cut the fucking ah!"
<br><br>"It's Master."
<br><br>The little boy's eyes flashed with excitement, waved the big knife in his hand and chopped and chopped over.
<br><br>Under the shocked eyes of Li Shuhua and others, the little boy chopped the group of demon dwellers in three strokes, without much effort!
