The face.
<br><br>Reflected in her eyes.
<br><br>It immediately made her stunned in place, her mind like a lightning strike.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"It's actually him?"
<br><br>"How is this possible?"
<br><br>With just a side face, Jiang Hong still recognized him at a glance.
<br><br>This face was just too familiar to her.
<br><br>At this moment, it was completely impossible to use words to describe the shocking waves in her heart.
<br><br>This was just too incredible.
<br><br>This great power with eyes in the sky was actually the Human Immortal she had seen several times on the island. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>She felt like the heavens had played a joke on her.
<br><br>"Wow, you."
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng also looked his gaze over and directly recognized Jiang Zhi and said with a smile, "As I expected, you've come to me after all."
<br><br>For the Jiang Zhi who appeared.
<br><br>Yi Feng was not half surprised.
<br><br>This Shadow Island was not too big, not too small.
<br><br>But the only thing that can get nourished on this island is his place, as long as the people on the island know about this place, there is almost no reason not to come.
<br><br>Jiang Hong's eyes widened.
<br><br>He.
<br><br>He knew that I would come?
<br><br>Jiang Hong's heart was incredulous.
<br><br>"Yes, I knew from the beginning that you would come."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly saw through Jiang Hong's thoughts and laughed lightly, "But you, ah, stubborn and naughty, if you had trusted me earlier, why would you have suffered so much?"
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>The scene when he himself refuted Yi Feng is still fresh in his mind.
<br><br>"You give up, it is impossible for a human immortal to live ......"
<br><br>"Do not do this pointless struggle, no one can live on this island ......"
<br><br>"You are also a human immortal, where do you get this kind of confidence ......"
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>A thought to this.
<br><br>Jiang Hong pretty face suffocated red, just feel ashamed to face, hate to find a crack to burrow down.
<br><br>But then again.
<br><br>Who does not know that your son is a powerful hand and eye ah!
<br><br>You pretend to be a human immortal, who will not believe you.
<br><br>"Okay, since you're here, stay well!"
<br><br>"I'm going back to my room, there are still things."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, finished walking back to the room.
<br><br>And after Yi Feng left, a group of people all surrounded towards Jiang to.
<br><br>"Miss Jiang, the conversation you just had with Mr., you guys knew each other early?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, you seem to have early contact with the gentleman?"
<br><br>The crowd looked urgent and asked.
<br><br>"Uh, indeed ......"
<br><br>Jiang Hong responded with an embarrassed face, and only under the expectant gaze of the crowd did she tell the crowd about what she had just encountered with Yi Feng on the island.
<br><br>"Aiya, Miss Jiang you are really stupid!"
<br><br>"That's right, that wolf looks like Mr. killed well."
<br><br>"Yes, and that devouring shadow fish, that is the real devouring shadow fish, only with the strength of Mr., completely afraid of them, you are also, still stupid to think that the fish is harmless, that is, you are lucky, otherwise long gone."
<br><br>The crowd has been talking about.
<br><br>Said Jiang to face red to the root of the neck, stifled explanation: "I do not know the strength of Mr. Well."
<br><br>"But then again it's true, you were so contemptuous of Mr., Mr. not the slightest blame, just now also catch up with you, that Mr. very high regard for you ah!"
<br><br>"Lu Laoqi is right, the gentleman thinks highly of you at first glance."
<br><br>"Miss Jiang, you have to take care of more in the future."
<br><br>"Yes, in the future, in front of the gentleman, give us a few more good words."
<br><br>"Please give us more encouragement in the future."
<br><br>For a while, the attitude of the crowd towards Jiang Zhi also changed greatly.
<br><br>Because it was likely that this Jiang Zhi would be a big hit in front of Mr. in the future.
<br><br>For the things that happened outside.
<br><br>Yi Feng was completely unaware, his mind was fully immersed in his own cultivation.
<br><br>Honestly.
<br><br>Even if you know that you are now quite strong, but Yi Feng still has a lot of confusion in his mind.
<br><br>For example.
<br><br>Those immortal yuan that everyone has in immortal cultivators, he does not have at all.
<br><br>As for cultivation.
<br><br>He still didn't know how to cultivate.
<br><br>Swallowing Qi and absorbing Qi?
<br><br>He could not even let out a fart.
<br><br>And other people a reincarnation of immortals can cause a mountain of movement, but he could not get out.
<br><br>A few days in a row.
<br><br>Yi Feng was thinking about this problem.
<br><br>Although now return to salted fish life, but the prerequisite guarantee of salted fish life, but also has to be strength ah.
<br><br>So figure out what's going on with your strength, it's urgent.
<br><br>Besides, sometimes sulking, occasionally want to pretend in front of people it.
<br><br>In addition to that.
<br><br>There is also a top priority thing is, the last disciple thing.
<br><br>Although the fifty level, but before the system said the words do not necessarily count.
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>Yi Feng is very annoyed.
<br><br>Especially this feeling of not being able to grasp, not being able to feel, is the most.
<br><br>In case something goes wrong with this, or the system pits him again, and he loses this cultivation, won't he have to cool off?
<br><br>"It seems that I also have to make second-hand preparations ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his chin.
<br><br>Feelings want to completely salty fish down, is impossible.
<br><br>At least, also have to solve these problems at hand.
<br><br>"Old Gong ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng beat the bushel fan, leisurely shouted.
<br><br>"Sir I am."
<br><br>Gong Chen respectfully came to Yi Feng's front.
<br><br>"I'm going to, let go of some conditions and absorb more people to come to me." Yi Feng said leisurely.
<br><br>At that Gong Chen was shocked.
<br><br>"What do you mean, sir?"
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and said, "In the future, everyone on this island, as long as their character is not particularly bad, in theory, can come to me, even if their cultivation is almost okay."
<br><br>"Great fortune for the world!"
<br><br>"Great fortune for Dark Shadow Island."
<br><br>Gong Chen knelt directly to the ground, excited.
<br><br>"Uh, you don't need to be so excited."
<br><br>Yi Feng was quite speechless.
<br><br>This guy, thought he was giving back to society by taking in refugees?
<br><br>What he wanted was to absorb as many strong people as possible and use them for himself, right?
<br><br>Prevent is, one day in the future, in case the system pitted him, not to no one cover before so.
<br><br>"Sir needless to say, the deep meaning subordinates know!"
<br><br>"I'll go tell the others now."
<br><br>After saying that, Gong Chen trotted towards the others.
<br><br>At the same time, his face was red with excitement.
<br><br>He now made up his mind that after he went out this time, he would say whatever he had to do to get his son outside into Shadow Island.
<br><br>If there is really no way to get in, the big deal is to cut him two messengers of the Heaven's Immortal Palace.
<br><br>There are also a few old friends who play well outside.
<br><br>In the past they always said they had the benefit of not calling them, this time it is important to inform in place.
