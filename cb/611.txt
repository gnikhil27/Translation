Inside a luxurious tavern.
<br><br>The white-robed youth walked in urgently.
<br><br>"Uncle Luo, please help me protect the spell, I will first recognize this top-grade immortal weapon before I do."
<br><br>After giving a solemn explanation, the white-robed youth urgently took a seat in the room.
<br><br>Then he couldn't wait to take out the top-grade immortal weapon.
<br><br>Put it in his hand and observed it.
<br><br>This was a top-grade immortal sword.
<br><br>The shape was ordinary, but it had a heavy weight in the hand, and the mind could also clearly feel the terrifying energy within it.
<br><br>"Enlighten!"
<br><br>Immortal Yuan wrapped around the immortal sword, causing it to float in front of his body.
<br><br>At the same time, the white robed youth's body of terrifying immortal yuan also ran up. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>He directly began to refine the immortal sword and take it for himself.
<br><br>And with Uncle Luo guarding the outer door, he was not afraid of any problems.
<br><br>A drop of crimson blood slipped out from his fingertips and dripped down on the floating immortal sword.
<br><br>With the addition of fresh blood, refining it would be twice as easy with half the effort.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was an extremely repulsive force spreading out from the immortal sword, almost lifting the white-robed youth sitting on the bed.
<br><br>Although he was able to stabilize his body in time, he was still very uncomfortable.
<br><br>A trace of blood spilled out from the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>"I can't imagine that with my blood, plus my full cultivation power, I can't refine it!"
<br><br>"Top-tier immortal weapons are worthy of being top-tier immortal weapons, it is rumored that divine weapons that have reached this level already have a spirit, and now it really seems to be true."
<br><br>He was not surprised but happy, and the light in his eyes was instead the more flourishing.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>The stronger the immortal sword behaved, the more powerful it would be able to bring him after it was truly refined.
<br><br>"Rather, I underestimated the top-tier immortal weapon."
<br><br>"It seems that I need to sacrifice my essence blood."
<br><br>"Although my essence blood is precious, but for the sake of this top-tier immortal weapon, even if I consume one drop, it will be worth it."
<br><br>As he spoke.
<br><br>He bit through the tip of his tongue.
<br><br>A drop of blood spilled out, it was actually golden, and even the blood itself was glowing with light.
<br><br>It then dripped down the tip of his tongue.
<br><br>It landed on the immortal sword.
<br><br>"Refining!"
<br><br>The moment the essence blood fell, the white-robed youth quickly made hand seals, and his body's power enveloped towards the immortal sword without reservation.
<br><br>Boom!
<br><br>Once again, the Immortal Sword recoiled.
<br><br>A powerful force abruptly erupted from it, hitting the white-robed youth's body heavily and causing him to fly backwards.
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>"What the hell is wrong with this broken sword!"
<br><br>His face was gloomy as he drank reluctantly, "How come even with the power of my essence blood, I can't refine it!"
<br><br>Just when his face was resigned and he didn't know what to do, an abrupt voice suddenly appeared in the room.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Even if this sword is a random one among my master's thousands of rags, but without his consent, how can it be refined by a trash like you?"
<br><br>This voice fell.
<br><br>At once, the white-robed youth shuddered violently, his hair towered, and his back chilled.
<br><br>Because with his strength, he actually could not sense exactly where this person was.
<br><br>What made him feel even more appalled was that Luo Lao was guarding the outside of the room door, and at this moment there was not the slightest movement, apparently he also did not find this person's presence at all.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>"Since you're here, why do you need to hide your head?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth raised his guard, looked into the void of the room, and shouted.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell.
<br><br>It was then that he saw a black-robed man appear out of thin air in front of him.
<br><br>He was small in size.
<br><br>His body was wrapped in a huge robe.
<br><br>As for the appearance, it was wrapped in a thick layer of mist, so it was impossible to see his true appearance clearly.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth's eyes narrowed, while also taking back the immortal sword that had yet to be refined.
<br><br>"Eternal God!"
<br><br>"Bone Ben Wei!"
<br><br>Lightly spoken voices came out of the black robe.
<br><br>Behind that mist, there seemed to be a pair of cold eyes looking at him, which made the white-robed youth's hair and bones creep out and subconsciously took two steps back.
<br><br>But when he heard the words of the black-robed man, he suddenly was not afraid instead, raised his head and laughed.
<br><br>"Bone Ben Wei, if I guessed correctly, you are what those three trash mouth of what Bone Grand Master, right? Also eternal robbery god, what a joke!"
<br><br>The white-robed youth completely relaxed and looked coldly at the black-robed man in front of him, saying chestily, "Although I don't know by what means you have evaded Elder Luo's and my perceptions, do you really think I haven't checked you out?"
<br><br>"You are neither from the Heaven's Immortal Hall, nor are there any great powers above the Star Immortal realm, nor is there such a person as you at all."
<br><br>"So?"
<br><br>From the black robe, an odd voice came out.
<br><br>"So, this prince does not put you in his eyes."
<br><br>"As for you coming, you must also be here for this immortal sword, right?"
<br><br>The white-robed youth teasingly raised the corner of his mouth and said leisurely, "The Immortal Sword is in my hand, let me see, what are you capable of taking it over."
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Under the black robe.
<br><br>Just a simple sentence.
<br><br>But after this sentence fell.
<br><br>The gravity of the entire room, boom enhanced ten thousand times.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, the white robed youth who was just full of smiles changed his face drastically, and his legs, completely unable to withstand the absolute gravity, exploded and exploded into shreds of flesh.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>The youth who lost both legs, the upper half of his body directly planted on the ground.
<br><br>Mournful screams came out, tearing his heart and lungs.
<br><br>The crippled body lying on the floor, moreover, could not even move, just like a hundred thousand mountains pressing on his body.
<br><br>Then, the youth saw the black-robed man flick his finger.
<br><br>Then his palm, which was clutching the immortal sword, actually burst again out of thin air and exploded into a rain of blood.
<br><br>"Ah ！！！！"
<br><br>Harsh screams, once again, came from his mouth, the pain of the youth's body cold sweat.
<br><br>That kind of power just now ......
<br><br>actually, actually made him unable to resist it!
<br><br>"What the hell are you?"
<br><br>The youth was lying on the ground and raised his head full of hatred.
<br><br>The black-robed man did not say a word.
<br><br>Just looking at him from a high position.
<br><br>And it was this appearance of not saying a word that made the youth feel creepy.
<br><br>"Gongzi, there seems to be movement in the room, are you okay?" Just at that moment, Luo Lao's inquiring voice came from outside the door.
<br><br>Hearing this voice, the youth's eyes shone brightly, as if he had grabbed a life-saving straw.
<br><br>"Luo Lao, save me."
<br><br>He shouted the loudest voice he could with all his strength.
<br><br>As the voice fell, the door of the room behind him exploded abruptly.
<br><br>It was Luo Lao who rushed in.
<br><br>When he came in and saw the youth who had lost both legs as well as one palm lying on the ground like a cicada chrysalis, Luo Lao's face changed greatly.
<br><br>"Gongzi, what happened!"
<br><br>"Him, it's all him, hurry up and kill him for me, I want him to go to hell!"
<br><br>Seeing Luo Lao arrive in front of him, the only palm of the youth pointed at the black-robed man in front of him, hostile voice came out hysterical.
<br><br>"How dare you hurt the Duke, even if you go to heaven and earth, I will tell you to die!"
<br><br>Luo Lao is also instantly out of the sword.
<br><br>This sword.
<br><br>The sword intent alone enveloped the entire room into a vacuum.
<br><br>And the sword in his hand was an intermediate level immortal weapon.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This strike is a killing move, without the slightest reservation.
<br><br>Obviously Luo Lao also knew that the black-robed man in front of him was able to waste the Reincarnation Immortal realm youth into this appearance under his eyes, must be a supreme expert.
