Soon, the three major genius disciples of the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom, and the second batch of sub-disciples of this Sun and Moon Peak all knelt down in front of Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Guo Shijie sat on a chair.
<br><br>He hadn't had time to heal his wounds since he was punished by the sect elders on the life and death stage and came back.
<br><br>Now the heart is still vaguely painful.
<br><br>While rubbing his heart, Guo Shijie opened his mouth to the disciples below.
<br><br>"Today's incident at the Life and Death Stage, I'm sure everyone has seen it with their own eyes."
<br><br>His face was wiped clean of blood and flesh, but there were still dried blood stains on his clothes that he hadn't had time to change.
<br><br>It carried a fishy smell.
<br><br>He waved the blood on his clothes.
<br><br>The blood mist immediately scattered in the air, and the smell of blood became even stronger.
<br><br>"This matter is a humiliation to my Sun Moon Sect." Guo Shijie said, hatred rose again on his face. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Can you guys tolerate it?!"
<br><br>"Can't!"
<br><br>The kneeling bunch of disciples shouted in unison.
<br><br>It was also filled with hatred.
<br><br>Guo Shijie nodded in satisfaction, "That's good. My Sun Moon Peak will never tolerate cowardly people who are greedy for life and death."
<br><br>"Since Yi Feng and Star Peak have humiliated my Sun Moon Peak so much, they will definitely be made to pay the price."
<br><br>Guo Shijie said.
<br><br>"In three days, it will be the sect trial."
<br><br>"The three of you ......" Guo Shijie gazed at the three geniuses of the Tianfu Kingdom kneeling at the front, "Make sure to bag the top three!"
<br><br>"Remember, never let any trash from Star Peak, enter the top three!"
<br><br>"Yes!" The three geniuses of the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom immediately answered.
<br><br>All three of them were at the level of Xuan Xian. Not to mention that the Star Peak disciples couldn't compare, even among the inner disciples. They were also the absolute best.
<br><br>Therefore, it was easy for the three of them to just bag the top three among the newly initiated disciples' trials.
<br><br>"As for you guys." Guo Shijie said, pointing to the second batch of people kneeling behind the three.
<br><br>"As for you guys, although you are not needed to bag the top three, your tasks are also important."
<br><br>"First, assist the three of them to achieve a top three ranking." Guo Shijie said, "Although the three of them are already very strong, they don't need your assistance under normal circumstances."
<br><br>"But there are many people in Star Peak, so we can't rule out that there are also people who want to compete for the top three, your first task is to assist the three of them in suppressing the losers in Star Peak."
<br><br>"If there are restless ones in Star Peak, then just kill them."
<br><br>"The second well." Guo Shijie said paused and slowly said, his gaze shadowy, "It is also one of the most important things this time."
<br><br>The words fell, the entire Sun Moon Peak people are quiet as a chicken, ears erect to listen to the command.
<br><br>The next moment, Guo Shijie's gloomy and hateful voice came, "Star Peak Yi Feng, kill anyone who sees it!"
<br><br>"The person who kills Yi Feng, after coming out, regardless of whether they get the ranking, I have a heavy reward!"
<br><br>What a big gesture ......
<br><br>Even the people of Sun Moon Peak were shocked.
<br><br>In order to kill one Yi Feng, it was actually an order to all the disciples of Sun Moon Peak.
<br><br>It is all ah!
<br><br>This disciples first not to mention the endless number of Heavenly Immortals, and the second batch of countless Golden Immortals.
<br><br>Even, there were three Xuan Immortals from the Heavenly Kingdom!
<br><br>Just this lineup, gave the order to kill anyone who sees Yi Feng ......
<br><br>"Understood?!" Guo Shijie asked loudly again.
<br><br>This time, he wanted Yi Feng to die for sure!
<br><br>"Yes!" The pile of disciples below heavily answered.
<br><br>At this moment, Guo Shijie, who had finished instructing, took a breather and coughed twice.
<br><br>"By the way, Yi Feng may have treasures on his body." He reminded again, "If you fight, you should not be too lightly defeated."
<br><br>"It is best to achieve a single kill with full power."
<br><br>"If the condition is possible, to be sure, it is better for you guys to team up and surround him."
<br><br>Hearing the response from below, Guo Shijie nodded in satisfaction.
<br><br>This time, even if Yi Feng used more treasures, he would not be able to survive.
<br><br>This was the result he wanted.
<br><br>After the command, Guo Shijie's heart was much more relieved, and the matter that had been nagging at him seemed to have been put down.
<br><br>Because he knew that this time, Yi Feng would surely die.
<br><br>He didn't have to worry about it either.
<br><br>"I'm going to be in seclusion during this period of time, the matter of the Disciple Trial Conference, prepare yourselves. No matter, do not come to disturb my seclusion."
<br><br>"As for the promised heavy reward after killing Yi Feng, I will definitely fulfill it when I come out of seclusion."
<br><br>At the same time, Star Peak.
<br><br>Liu Yan also gave a solemn order to his disciples.
<br><br>This time, Yi Feng made Sun Moon Peak suffer such a big defeat. Sun and Moon Peak will definitely not let go.
<br><br>Three days later is the disciple trial meeting, according to Guo Shijie's urine, will certainly take this opportunity to revenge Star Peak.
<br><br>Yi Feng is definitely in the Sun Moon Peak to revenge the key figures.
<br><br>Liu Yan was also very worried and recruited all the disciples who were going to participate in the trial assembly and started instructing.
<br><br>"This time the trial meeting, certainly more dangerous than in previous years."
<br><br>"We messed with Sun Moon Peak and killed five of their disciples. They definitely won't be willing to give up."
<br><br>"If I'm not wrong, this Trial Conference is the time they will act!"
<br><br>As the words fell, the Star Peak elder next to him and the group of disciples underneath all became serious.
<br><br>"So our people, try not to fall alone. If you encounter the disciples of Sun Moon Peak, try to avoid them. If you can't avoid them, the more people you gather together, the more chances you have to win."
<br><br>"Understood?"
<br><br>"Yes!" The disciples at the bottom answered one after another.
<br><br>"As much as I want you guys to get a good result, just do your best."
<br><br>Liu Yan instructed again, "After all, your own life is more important."
<br><br>"If the situation is not right, remember not to disregard even your own life for the sake of the ranking, got it?"
<br><br>The disciples at the bottom also answered.
<br><br>Liu Yan said, deliberately looking at Yi Feng, she said to him, "Your character is too sharp, but this time you must not be reckless either!"
<br><br>"This time it's not the level of the five Earth Immortals on the Life and Death Stage."
<br><br>"The Sun and Moon Peak disciples are in the thousands, and there is no shortage of experts among them. Among them there are also three Xuan Xian of the ranks of the three geniuses of the Heavenly Kingdom, you must avoid with them."
<br><br>"Otherwise you are even more powerful, this time I am afraid that you will die inside, no one can save you."
<br><br>Yi Feng folded his hands in his sleeves and looked at Liu Yan in a good way.
<br><br>Hearing her instructions, originally disdainful. But seeing Liu Yan's painstaking look, he was too lazy to listen to her more nagging.
<br><br>So nodded obediently, "Don't worry, Peak Master, I'll be gentle."
<br><br>"Hmm?" Liu Yan was confused.
<br><br>"Oh no, wrong words, I will be careful." Yi Feng hurriedly changed his words, "Peak Master put a million hearts into it."
<br><br>Xuan Xian?
<br><br>A mere Xuan Xian, trying to kill him?
<br><br>He had a bunch of Reincarnation Immortal Mirror subordinates.
<br><br>So what if you can't beat them?
<br><br>I have a lot of big brothers under me.
<br><br>Killing these trash is as easy as killing a chicken and a dog?
<br><br>The corner of Yi Feng's mouth hooked up an evil smile.
<br><br>He was afraid that those trash wouldn't kill himself, so he wouldn't have a reason to clean them up.
<br><br>A bunch of dogs, just wait.
<br><br>When the time came, as long as one of the Sun Moon Peak's doggies made a move against himself, he would have an excuse to hunt down and kill all the Sun Moon Peak's people.
<br><br>Righteous and justified.
