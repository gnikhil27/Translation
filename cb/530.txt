See Yi Feng's anger has not subsided, white collar days despite intestinal regret, but the heart is still reluctant.
<br><br>After all, he really did not know the identity of this person ah!
<br><br>If he had known, he would not have dared to do so even if he had been given a hundred guts.
<br><br>So, he gritted his teeth and had to bring out Wu Tian and said, "Sir, I already know that our sins are serious, but I hope that you will spare our lives for the sake of Lord Wu Tian."
<br><br>"Wu Tian?"
<br><br>"Who is Wu Tian?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned and looked at the two in confusion.
<br><br>"Uh!"
<br><br>The two people were suddenly dumbfounded.
<br><br>This one, didn't know Lord Wu Tian?
<br><br>Was there a mistake about the person? One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But it shouldn't be, no matter from the strength, means, appearance, temperament or "Taijiquan" all aspects seem to be, this is the mysterious gentleman Wu Tian Da said in his mouth!
<br><br>"Sir you think again, Wu Tian, mouth Tian Wu, the sky of the sky." White collar sky said with a face full of expectation.
<br><br>"Oh ...... is the mouth Tian Wu, Wu Tian?"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, it's this Wu Tian." White Collar Sky responded with a face full of excitement.
<br><br>"Sorry, I can't recall this person at all, don't play these ghost ideas with me, say it, what do you want me to do with you." Yi Feng pulled out a large knife from inside the spatial ring and directly set it on Bai Lingtian's head, saying coldly.
<br><br>This long knife came out.
<br><br>The coldness was overwhelming.
<br><br>White collar day a glance to recognize is a super immortal weapon, immediately scared shit out of control.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here!
<br><br>This one, how come you don't recognize Lord Wu Tian.
<br><br>Full of bitterness, White Collar Heaven was so anxious that he was about to cry.
<br><br>Just at this moment, he fiercely saw a portrait hanging on the wall of the hall.
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>It was like he grabbed the straw that saved his life.
<br><br>Because this portrait was exactly Wu Tian's.
<br><br>After all, today Wu Tian was the faith of everyone in the entire Wu Tian Empire, the spiritual pillar of the entire empire, so every household had his portrait for pilgrimage.
<br><br>So he hurriedly pointed to Wu Tian's portrait and shivered and shouted, "Sir, please incline your head and look, that's him, he is Lord Wu Tian."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously inclined his gaze.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>There was a painting hanging on the wall.
<br><br>Yi Feng squinted his eyes and looked at it carefully, thought for a long time, and finally had a little concept in his mind.
<br><br>Now he said with a sudden realization: "So you are talking about this little trash ah, you told me earlier, what Wu Tian not Wu Tian, I called him a little chicken."
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>Yi Feng is also quite a bit of emotion.
<br><br>I remember a few years ago, the martial arts school is such a little guy.
<br><br>Also fallen homeless, so in his martial arts school stayed for a while, said and Zhong Qing is a bit like the.
<br><br>But the difference is that he is too wasted.
<br><br>Not to mention the qualification of cultivation, even the qualification of practicing martial arts is not.
<br><br>Zhong Qing is at least an ordinary talent, martial arts practice is still a little perceptive, this guy is simply super garbage can not be counted, usually stupid like a pig.
<br><br>Even then, he was taught to defend himself at critical moments with a handful of monkeys stealing peaches, it took a long time to learn.
<br><br>The white collar day saw Yi Feng finally remembered Wu Tian, immediately excited.
<br><br>But when hearing Yi Feng's words, and is full of black face.
<br><br>What little trash.
<br><br>What little chick.
<br><br>It was clearly the supreme king of their Wu Tian Empire, right?
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>"I didn't expect you guys actually know Chicken Little, tell me, what is your relationship with him?" Yi Feng looked at the two and asked.
<br><br>"Enlightened sir, we are the subordinates of Lord Wu Tian!" The two men said respectfully.
<br><br>"Subordinates?"
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at them and said rather mockingly, "Subordinates are weak to this extent, it seems that after so many years, the little chickens really don't mix very well!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed rather helplessly.
<br><br>Although this child does not have much cultivation talent, but the character is still quite good.
<br><br>At the beginning, Yi Feng felt that if this child was lucky, maybe he could be a bit of a success.
<br><br>I thought this child is now mixed quite well, but now it seems that perhaps a little family, but if you say mixed well is not really.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's words, but let the two mouth corners straight twitch.
<br><br>The Wu Heavenly Lord is the king of the Wu Heavenly Empire, the supreme existence, in your mouth, actually is not very well mixed?
<br><br>"By the way, Chicken Little is from here?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Your honor, sir, Lord Wu Tian is indeed a person here." The two men said respectfully.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>He also did not expect that by mistake, he had actually arrived at Chicken Little's hometown.
<br><br>"You two go, tell him that I am here, after all, this is also his hometown, he as the host, how can he have to entertain me properly?" Yi Feng waved his hand and instructed towards the two.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The two people's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Since Yi Feng said that, it seemed that he was able to bypass their lives, otherwise he wouldn't have asked them to inform Lord Wu Tian.
<br><br>After the two thanked them, they rushed back with their butts in the air.
<br><br>After they left, Yi Feng glared at Bone Ben Wei, but after all, this punk is a little merit today, so he did not pursue.
<br><br>Instead, he turned his gaze back to Yuan Jing.
<br><br>Sensing Yi Feng's gaze, Yuan Jing's body trembled slightly, biting her red lips nervously, her hands and feet were nowhere to be found.
<br><br>"Miss Yuan, when the little chickens come over, let's go out together for two days?" Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>After all, he thought that this girl is also quite good, and has spent a lot of money for him during this period of time.
<br><br>When Chicken Little came, it was still necessary to call her if she invited him to eat and get high.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"I... Is it really okay?"
<br><br>"Will he disagree, Lord Wu Tian?"
<br><br>Yuan Jing instantly revealed a flattered look.
<br><br>Never would have thought that Yi Feng would actually invite her.
<br><br>One had to know that the chick that Yi Feng was talking about was the titular Wu Tian kingdom ruler!
<br><br>In the past, it was not even a luxury to meet, let alone to go play together.
<br><br>How could she be able to meet at such a level?
<br><br>"What's this?"
<br><br>"The little chicken still dare to say anything can not, my ass board shoot him to death."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly, stretched a lazy back, then walked back towards the room, intending to continue to go to sleep a back to sleep.
<br><br>Yuan Jing bit her red lips tightly and looked at Yi Feng's back.
<br><br>What happened today made her feel like she was in a dream.
<br><br>The Yi Feng and Skeleton Ben Wei beside her were not only supreme experts, but she actually had the honor of meeting the Wu Tian Guojun next.
<br><br>But at the same time.
<br><br>Her heart is very uncomfortable.
<br><br>She is such a small role, I am afraid that even Wu Tian Guojun's eyes can not enter.
<br><br>Not to mention, this Wu Tian Guojun in his eyes, is only worthy to be called a small trash existence.
<br><br>This kind of gap.
<br><br>It was like a gap between the heavens!
<br><br>She couldn't help but smile bitterly, her heart bursting with astringency.
<br><br>I'm afraid that in Yi Feng's eyes, she was just a junior who could make him happy!
