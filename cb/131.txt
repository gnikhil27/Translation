The door finally slowly pushed open.
<br><br>At the same time, the two women's nerves were tense to the extreme.
<br><br>However, what appeared in front of the two women was a green robe, with a gentle smile of the youth.
<br><br>He was carrying a small bamboo basket, holding a sickle in his left hand, and on the middle finger of his right hand, there was a few pounds of kingfisher hanging!
<br><br>"Yi Feng?"
<br><br>"How could it be you?"
<br><br>The two women almost spoke in unison, looking at Yi Feng with incredulous faces, while their hearts set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>"Long time no see."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly and greeted the two women, "I really can't help it, I'm afraid I have to disturb you again."
<br><br>"Not you, you you ......"
<br><br>Mao Mao was like seeing a ghost, staring and pointing at Yi Feng, "How on earth did you find this place?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I was here last time, and then just walked over here." Yi Feng stretched his hands and explained.
<br><br>At that, the two women's eyelids jumped, could not help but look at each other.
<br><br>Just walk over?
<br><br>Do you really think that the formation they set up here is for show?
<br><br>Mao Mao wanted to continue to ask, but Bai Piao Piao gave her a wink without moving, and then smiled at Yi Feng: "What are you talking about, Mr. Yi, we are old friends, there is nothing to harass or not to harass!"
<br><br>"Thank you Miss Piao Piao, Miss Mao Mao, you are really good people." Yi Feng said with a face full of gratitude.
<br><br>"You're welcome, I'm sure you're very tired from the long journey!" Bai Piao Piao ordered softly, "Mao Mao, you take the gentleman to the last guest room to settle down."
<br><br>"Thank you very much, Miss."
<br><br>Yi Feng gave a slight salute.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao returned the salute with a smile, and indeed, although Yi Feng was a mortal, he was very different from ordinary mortals, both in connotation, behavior and demeanor, all made people feel comfortable.
<br><br>Therefore, she was not repulsed by Yi Feng's arrival.
<br><br>Suddenly, she seemed to remember something and hurriedly shouted, "By the way gongzi, did you leave something behind last time?"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and thought for half a day but couldn't come up with a reason, so he had to say embarrassingly, "Hey, I really can't remember what I left behind, so please tell me straight."
<br><br>"Gongzi is really careless!"
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's dumbfounded look, Bai Piao Piao couldn't help but cover her mouth and smile, while picking up the Dream of the Red Chamber from the side of the piano, handing it over and saying, "This book, it should be very important to you, right?"
<br><br>"Oh, so this is it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly realized, thought it was something, it turned out to be this broken book, then laughed: "This thing is nothing, lost, if the girl likes it, then give it to the girl!"
<br><br>Hearing that, with a smile on his face, Bai Piao Piao, his eyebrows did not show traces of frown.
<br><br>"How can the Duke, so unappreciative of this book?"
<br><br>She raised her pretty face and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"It's just a book, there's nothing to value." Yi Feng laughed indifferently, after all, this book was originally written by him, there are still a lot of unsold ones at home, either he used to pad the foot of the bed or wipe his ass.
<br><br>"It seems that I have misunderstood."
<br><br>White floating eyes show a touch of disappointment.
<br><br>The last time she saw Yi Feng leave this book, she thought that Yi Feng was also a book lover and a big fan of this book, but now it seems that it is not.
<br><br>If not, he would certainly treat this book as a treasure.
<br><br>"Sir, go rest first!" White Puffy said softly.
<br><br>"Then I will leave first."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded and followed Mao Mao towards the guest room.
<br><br>After settling down, Mao Mao was just about to leave, but she, who was flashing her big puzzled eyes, couldn't help but turn back and ask: "You really, just walked in like that?"
<br><br>"What kind of words is that, girl, I can't always fly in, right?" Yi Feng said with a face full of confusion.
<br><br>Mao Mao scratched his big head and looked at Yi Feng in confusion before trotting away.
<br><br>"Miss, settle him down." Mao Mao came back and reported.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao nodded, then murmured softly, "Could it be that there's something wrong with our formation?"
<br><br>"I think so too." Mao Mao said approvingly, "Otherwise, in the state where the formation is open, the Martial Emperor can't even find where we are, it's too incredible that he, a mortal, can find this place."
<br><br>"In that case, hurry up and take a look!" Bai Piaoqiao instructed, "If it's really a formation problem, fix it as soon as possible."
<br><br>"Yes Miss."
<br><br>Mao Mao's body swept up and fell towards the outside of the courtyard.
<br><br>However, just a moment after she went out, she ran back with a face full of anxiety, panting and puffing.
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piaoqiao frowned and hurriedly greeted her and asked, "Mao Mao, what is going on?"
