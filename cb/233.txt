Despite not knowing what Yi Feng means by long hemorrhoids, the crowd still nodded like a chicken pecking rice.
<br><br>Finally, in a state of trepidation, came to the front of Yi Feng.
<br><br>The good thing is that Song Ke did not move, the crowd breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Many thanks to senior for saving my life before!"
<br><br>The crowd bowed in gratitude.
<br><br>"Where is the grace of saving lives, no need to be polite."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, saving this group of people who were surrounded by beasts before was just a coincidence, it was not much for him.
<br><br>And this group of people called him senior, Yi Feng did not think much of it.
<br><br>The strongest are the most respected, right?
<br><br>These people a dozen beasts can not handle, call him a senior also in the reasonable.
<br><br>The crowd also relaxed a lot, it seems that this high man is still very easygoing. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After introducing each other, after some small talk, Li Shuhua and others also followed Yi Feng two people camped.
<br><br>After all, they didn't dare to go by themselves.
<br><br>"Yah!"
<br><br>"This piece of wood is so peculiar!"
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng suddenly found the back of the acacia tree trunk, there is a piece of extraordinarily different, immediately aroused his curiosity.
<br><br>"Disciple, give me the knife."
<br><br>"It's Master."
<br><br>Receiving the knife from Zhong Qing's hand, Yi Feng walked towards it.
<br><br>However, Li Shuhua and other people's hearts were stuck in their throats.
<br><br>This was Old Demon Song Ke's Heart of the Tree!
<br><br>What did this big brother want?
<br><br>And this piece of tree heart looks ordinary, but if you really want to play any attention to it, Song Ke will not allow it?
<br><br>Li Shuhua and the others gulped and looked at Yi Feng nervously.
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng, has come to the heart of the tree, with the knife handle knocked, immediately came out excited shout: "ah, this wood is actually a really good thing ah, this material if I carve, carved out of the work must be great, may be able to let my carving skills refine a few points it."
<br><br>Saying that, he turned back towards Zhong Qing and shouted, "Disciple, come and help me, pick this piece of wood off."
<br><br>Song Ke, who was in a state of concealment, looked shocked.
<br><br>Good man.
<br><br>It's too much to bully the tree!
<br><br>He did not kill these two humans because of the mysterious pressure, but this damn human actually hit his tree's heart.
<br><br>It is unbearable.
<br><br>When Yi Feng turned his head, the heart of the tree steeply glowed with a white light, vaguely murderous will appear, condensing a huge energy to attack out towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Shuhua and others were greatly alarmed.
<br><br>Just want to shout to remind Yi Feng, but the power contained in the heart of the tree towards Yi Feng impacted the past.
<br><br>The distance between the two was only one foot.
<br><br>It was already too late.
<br><br>And at this distance, by Song Ke this power unguarded attack, unless to the martial emperor, I'm afraid, will also, the gutter overturned it!
<br><br>Can't help but, Li Shuhua people's faces scared white.
<br><br>And in the nick of time, Yi Feng also turned back to look at the heart of the tree.
<br><br>Straight feel a gust of wind blowing, a cold nose, a wriggle under ......
<br><br>"Ah-choo ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng fiercely a sneeze out.
<br><br>However, this one sneeze directly touched the nerves of Li Shuhua and others, directly subverting their worldview.
<br><br>Hiss.
<br><br>What a fucking awesome sneeze!
<br><br>The crowd's mouths drew in cold air.
<br><br>Because this sneeze came down and directly dispersed the attack that was sent from the heart of the tree.
<br><br>Not a single bit remained.
<br><br>And this shocking scene was seen by Song Ke, also immediately stunned silly.
<br><br>The entire oversized acacia tree, in this moment also violently trembled!
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What the fuck divine means?
<br><br>Song Ke directly doubt life.
<br><br>Although his cultivation was suppressed by an invisible force, but relying on the heart of the tree was still able to play a full-strength strike.
<br><br>His full power strike was a Demon Saint strike!
<br><br>It was broken by a sneeze?
<br><br>In the midst of his shock, Song Ke felt a chill in his body.
<br><br>When he looked, he found that Yi Feng and Zhong Qing had taken their knives and gouged off a large part of his Tree Heart.
<br><br>With this half of the Tree Heart gouged off, Song Ke's realm quickly retreated, turning back to Half-Saint in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Song Ke's inner rage was overwhelming.
<br><br>He wanted to kill these two damn humans immediately.
<br><br>But before he did it, he remembered the terrifying methods of these two people, and the flame that had just risen was immediately extinguished.
<br><br>Can not fight ah!
<br><br>He wanted to cry without tears!
<br><br>The reasoning of the East Mountain is not afraid of burning firewood, Song Ke hard this hatred, to bear down with tears, intend to revenge in the future.
<br><br>"Well, with this thing, you can go back and carve something properly."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the heart of the tree in his hand and put it into the ring.
<br><br>On the side, Li Shuhua and others have been so shocked that they don't know how to describe it in words, and their brains have turned around.
<br><br>A sneeze broke Song Ke's Demon Saint Strike not to mention, and the purpose of gouging Song Ke's Heart of the Tree was just for carving?
<br><br>What a great stroke!
<br><br>But the more powerful Yi Feng is, the better it is for them too.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng does not have hostile intentions towards them, and they only need to follow Yi Feng, at least to be able to keep their lives safe.
<br><br>The crowd, which took a long time to slow down, sat down again.
<br><br>But at that moment.
<br><br>A series of strange sounds came from the distance, approaching this way.
<br><br>The crowd immediately got up and looked.
<br><br>And Yi Feng was equally no exception.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>"Wuhu ......"
<br><br>"Take off ......"
<br><br>"Ow ow ow, tired oh tired oh tired ......"
<br><br>Listening to these individual familiar yells, Li Shuhua and others' eyes glazed over, revealing a shocked look.
<br><br>"Are those the ones from before?"
<br><br>The voice fell.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>A black-robed man carrying a sack behind his back rushed towards this side, while a sky-devouring demon wolf dragging the sack followed behind him, with a centipede lying on the demon wolf's head.
<br><br>"It really is these three!"
<br><br>Li Shuhua and others were startled, watching them rushing towards this side, and quickly flashed to the side.
<br><br>After all, they were clear about the style of these guys, and they would take out whatever was stopped in front of them.
<br><br>But after they flashed away, they found that Yi Feng was still standing stupidly in the same place.
<br><br>Their faces instantly became anxious.
<br><br>Although they also know that Yi Feng is very strong, but with this black-robed man, easily trample Song Ke doppelganger under his feet means, is not weak at all ah!
<br><br>In case these two experts clash together, it would be a big deal.
<br><br>So they hurriedly shouted a reminder towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Senior, don't stop them, move aside and let them pass."
