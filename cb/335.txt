In the martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on a small bench with his head down, crafting a bow and arrow.
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>"Perfect."
<br><br>After making it, Yi Feng felt doubly satisfied.
<br><br>Then he got out some herbs and drummed them up and configured them into a numbing medicine.
<br><br>This was carefully crafted by him.
<br><br>Then he went out with the numbing medicine and the bow and arrow.
<br><br>To create a mountain gate, need to prepare for more things, such as the small back mountain, demon beasts can not get, always have to get some beasts shut in as a front it.
<br><br>And Yi Feng went out this time, is precisely want to catch some beasts back.
<br><br>Of course, Yi Feng also knows that these beasts are not bluffing the real cultivator. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The good thing is.
<br><br>After Yi Feng opened the mountain to receive disciples also did not intend to receive those who have good talent, will cultivate the disciples. At best, the kind of ordinary talent, or can not cultivate, but still want to be a cultivator of the kind.
<br><br>A hundred of them, after completing the task.
<br><br>And in recent times, it seems that the broken system saw Yi Feng's efforts, so it opened a new function for him.
<br><br>That is the ability to detect other people's talent.
<br><br>So Yi Feng first took Zhong Qing and tried it out.
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"Test subject: Zhong Qing."
<br><br>"Talent: ordinary."
<br><br>After detecting Zhong Qing, Yi Feng, who just walked out the door, saw a few old men selling tofu.
<br><br>So Yi Feng couldn't resist detecting it again.
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"Detection subject: Zhou Wu."
<br><br>"Talent: trash."
<br><br>The system returned Yi Feng's voice.
<br><br>"Detect Old Li."
<br><br>Yi Feng shifted the object.
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"Detection object: Li Tian."
<br><br>"Talent: trash."
<br><br>And after detecting these two people, Yi Feng couldn't help but detect all the other old men again, without exception, they were all trash.
<br><br>And walking down the street, perhaps in the curiosity of the new function, Yi Feng detected all the way.
<br><br>Garbage garbage, all garbage, not to mention excellent, even to be able to rival Zhong Qing ordinary talent is not one.
<br><br>"I originally thought my disciple was trash enough, but I didn't think that most people were even more trash than him."
<br><br>"It seems that those who can cultivate are really one in a million, most of them are trash with no cultivation talent!"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but feel, and in his heart, he also had a rough idea of these talents.
<br><br>General ordinary talent, such as his disciple Zhong Qing kind, is the green mountain door can not enter the.
<br><br>And ordinary up to the excellent level, I'm afraid that only the cultivator.
<br><br>Then, he walked towards the Makuhari Mountain Range with a bow and arrow on his back.
<br><br>At this time, an old man came out from the shadows and stared deadly at Yi Feng's back.
<br><br>"Little beast."
<br><br>"Mortal, you're actually a fucking mortal."
<br><br>"How hateful, to think that I, Old Devil Yan, with a cultivation of a Sixth Life Martial Emperor, was actually taken out by a mortal like you."
<br><br>"But fortunately, the one who died was the old man who practiced his doppelganger, otherwise I would have let you, a mortal, get away with it."
<br><br>He gritted his teeth and said.
<br><br>His face flashed with a strong sense of hatred and stifled anger.
<br><br>He was none other than Old Devil Yan, who was killed by Yi Feng's sword after being slapped with a few bricks within the immortal ruins.
<br><br>After the doppelganger died in the immortal ruins, his real body rushed over from the Central Continent without stopping, intending to practice Yi Feng into a stick.
<br><br>"Little bastard, stop right there."
<br><br>He walked straight out and bellowed coldly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng's footsteps stopped and looked back at this person.
<br><br>"Tsk, little bastard, you can't think of a thousand things, I'm actually still alive, right? I was careless and died by your hand that day!" Old Devil Yan said in a cold voice, "But today, is not that day, so today is the day you die."
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that in the face of his threat, Yi Feng acted indifferent.
<br><br>This made Old Devil Yan's expression grow colder and colder.
<br><br>This little bastard, was he not yet anticipating the severity of the matter, was he unaware that he was facing the revenge of a cultivator?
<br><br>"Little bastard, I'm curious, you're actually not afraid of me?" Old Devil Yan said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Do I know you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Old Devil Yan couldn't help but choke.
<br><br>It seems that this little bastard can't remember who he is, no wonder he wasn't afraid when he saw him.
<br><br>"Fine, fine, since you forgot who I am, then I will help you remember well." Old Devil Yan said coldly.
<br><br>But just halfway through saying it.
<br><br>It was directly interrupted by Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Sorry, I'm not interested in who you are, I have to continue on my way."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with an expressionless face and finished carrying his bow and arrow to continue his journey.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You, good you little bastard."
<br><br>Yan old devil angry body straight trembling, gritted his teeth and drank: "Little bastard, I'll help you recall well, the old man's name is Yan old devil!"
<br><br>"Yan Old Devil?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked back at him with a straight face.
<br><br>Meditate hard.
<br><br>After a long, long time, his eyes finally lit up and shouted, "I remember, you are that, that ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Old Devil Yan smiled coldly.
<br><br>This little bastard finally remembered who he is, facing his revenge return, this little bastard should feel the fear of it.
<br><br>But Yi Feng's next words, but almost did not kill him.
<br><br>"You are that, that mountain bandit that I went to Nansha last time and hijacked the road in the middle of the road?"
<br><br>Old Devil Yan trembled.
<br><br>He had wanted to torment Yi Feng well and let him feel the fear before he died, but this little beast just hardened without remembering who he was and actually did not feel the slightest bit of fear.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>Does not matter.
<br><br>Directly to the strength of the suppression of it.
<br><br>In front of the absolute strength, will also let this little bastard feel enough fear.
<br><br>"Today, you will die."
<br><br>He let out a cold cry and raised his hand to launch an attack towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>This stance made Yi Feng also a little panic.
<br><br>So he hurriedly activated the system to detect Yan Old Devil's talent.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Detection object: Yan Old Devil."
<br><br>"Talent: super trash."
<br><br>Listening to the system's voice, Yi Feng couldn't help but be shocked.
<br><br>"Oh expansive."
<br><br>"There's actually a super trash talent."
<br><br>"Shit, the talent is garbage like this, the few old men around me can't compare, still want to block my way, tired of living!"
<br><br>Yi Feng did not panic at all.
<br><br>Unhurriedly picked up the bow and arrow in his hand, pulled the bow and shot out an arrow.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Yan old devil fell to the ground with a sound, his body was convulsing, his mouth was foaming while his eyes were flickering with disbelief.
<br><br>How could it be?
<br><br>How is it possible?
<br><br>He was a Sixth Life Martial Emperor, how could he have been knocked to the ground by a mortal's arrow, not even able to fight?
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>He hissed in his heart, staring at Yi Feng, who was looking down at him from above, with eyes that were about to burst out.
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his chin with the palm of his hand and looked down at Old Devil Yan carefully.
<br><br>"Misremembered, you should not be that mountain bandit, that mountain bandit is a one-eyed dragon."
<br><br>"However, you do look a bit familiar, but I really can't recall who you are."
<br><br>"Forget it, it doesn't matter."
<br><br>"Let's just pretend you're a mountain bandit!"
<br><br>While mumbling his thoughts, Yi Feng added another arrow to Old Devil Yan.
<br><br>Old Devil Yan directly lost his life.
<br><br>To his death, he did not understand why he had fallen into the hands of this mortal once again.
<br><br>After killing Old Devil Yan, Yi Feng continued his journey, slightly happy in his heart.
<br><br>"This system seems to have become a lot more reliable."
<br><br>"At least the function of detecting cultivation, it does not seem to be a pit."
<br><br>This is not, just now the system detects that goods talent super garbage, and as expected, weak pathetic, an arrow to him down.
<br><br>"This will be quite convenient in the future!"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but feel.
<br><br>For so many years, he had been honest, in fact, he was afraid of running into that kind of hidden bully character and getting himself killed.
<br><br>And with this detection function, whenever you encounter a conflict, you can first test the talent of the other party.
<br><br>Where the talent is less than excellent directly dry is, no longer need to goad.
<br><br>After all, the ordinary below excellent, that is, his disciple kind of goods, what is there to fear?
<br><br>Anyway, they are unable to cultivate the garbage just!
