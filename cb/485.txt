PS: Xiao Zhan advanced to the Golden Immortal ha, the last one has two places to type wrong.
<br><br>Turning eyes.
<br><br>Three days passed.
<br><br>Heavenly Spirit Sect as the southern domain of the Cang Dao Empire earth hegemony, the sect has a strong strength as well as heritage.
<br><br>Smoke and fog, surrounded by mountains, clouds and fog from time to time there are disciples flying past the sword, quite an immortal realm.
<br><br>And today this place is extraordinarily lively.
<br><br>The battle between Xiao Zhan and the Heavenly Spirit Sect's Holy Maiden Liu Nan Yan has long been spread throughout the Southern Domain, so the moment they heard the news, many people rushed towards the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>In addition to seeing Xiao Zhan's jokes, they also wanted to get a glimpse of the Heavenly Spirit Holy Maiden Liu Ruyan.
<br><br>Within the Heavenly Spirit Sect, Liu Ruyan sat on a futon, composing herself, seemingly unconcerned about today's duel.
<br><br>At this time, a middle-aged man came. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yan'er, how about it, do you have confidence in today's battle?"
<br><br>The man asked, it was precisely Liu Ruyan's master, also the patriarch of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, Yin Tianxiong.
<br><br>"Master, this is a battle without suspense, why is there confidence." Liu Ruyan said rather sarcastically.
<br><br>"That's true, it's rather undernourishing for me to ask this question."
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong smiled rather awkwardly, then said softly, "Yan'er, you won't blame me for making your Liu Family and Xiao Family become in the same boat, right?"
<br><br>"Master is joking, even without Master's relationship, me and that Xiao Zhan are not even in the same boat."
<br><br>"Besides, the Xiao family is kind to the Liu family, it is also a matter for the older generation, what does it have to do with me?" Liu Ruyan said expressionlessly.
<br><br>"It's good that you don't blame your master." Yin Tianxiong sighed and said, "After all, the marriage contract on you makes the Third Prince mindful, only if you show enough attitude, I'm afraid you will satisfy the Third Prince."
<br><br>"So in order to make a momentum today, I also pushed in the dark, moreover, the mountain gate is wide open so that more people can watch the battle."
<br><br>"Rather, it is thanks to the master." Liu Ruyan said gratefully.
<br><br>"What's the point, we clans are strong, the empire above our heads is ultimately pressing us ah, if you can tie the knot with the Third Prince, in the future your achievements will be much higher than in the Heavenly Spirit Sect, turn around my Heavenly Spirit Sect's foundation because of you, will also be more solid ah!" Yin Tianxiong said with emotion.
<br><br>"Master, you can rest assured, the Heavenly Spirit Sect's cultivation of me, I Liu Ruyan will not forget!" Liu Ruyan solemnly said.
<br><br>"With this word from you, it is good."
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong nodded gratefully, remembered something and solemnly reminded: "By the way, do not be soft-hearted, even if that Xiao Zhan killed is not a big deal, although the Third Prince did not personally come, but the people watching the battle will inevitably have his ears and eyes, in case you are soft-hearted so that the Third Prince misunderstood unhappy, this matter will be difficult to do. "
<br><br>"Don't worry, Master, I have it in my heart."
<br><br>Liu Ruyan nodded lightly.
<br><br>"Let's go, it's almost time, it's time to start."
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong said.
<br><br>The two then walked towards the outside.
<br><br>On the way up the mountain of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, the group of senior brothers, led by Su Yun Yun, had also arrived here.
<br><br>"Senior sister, senior brothers, actually this duel is no longer necessary for me today, it doesn't matter if I go or not."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan looked at the big scene of the Heavenly Spirit Sect and the many people who rushed to the mountain to watch the show, and said with a calm expression.
<br><br>From the time he became an immortal, his eyesight and the pattern of his life had changed greatly.
<br><br>The so-called heart demon also does not exist anymore.
<br><br>In his opinion, it was even more unnecessary to prove anything in front of Liu Ruyan.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>But just as his voice fell, Hong Crazy and Xiao Yun retorted in unison.
<br><br>When the two looked at each other, Hong Crazy took the lead and said, "If you don't fight, wouldn't your senior brother and I have made a trip for nothing, I was expecting to fight and destroy the Heavenly Spirit Sect."
<br><br>"Yes, I also pressed a heavy treasure on you, this treasure pressed down, your father I directly salted fish, if you do not fight, then I did not press for nothing?" Xiao Yun stared at the eyes followed by said.
<br><br>Two people's reasoning, so Xiao Zhan quite a bit speechless, can not help but look at Su Yun Yun Yun.
<br><br>"Senior sister, what do you think?" He asked.
<br><br>"Senior brother, although I understand your heart, but this move of yours can have the suspicion of a holy mother!" Su Yun Yun solemnly cautioned, "This is not the style of my Heaven and Earth Sect."
<br><br>"I understand, senior sister."
<br><br>Xiao Zhan dawned on him, and his gaze firmly looked toward the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>At this moment, a huge ring had long been set up in the square of the Heavenly Spirit Sect.
<br><br>And around the ring, hundreds of thousands of spectators had also gathered long ago.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Saintess Liu Ruyan appeared in the ring early and waited.
<br><br>Today she had a white dress, the color of frost blossomed like a snow lotus, her beautiful face and temperament made her the focus of the audience.
<br><br>"The holy maiden is worthy of being a holy maiden!"
<br><br>"Yes, at a young age, she has such strength, in addition to this kind of face, simply make people jealous ah!"
<br><br>"That what's-his-name Xiao family trash, how dare he challenge Miss Ruyan, he really doesn't know how high the sky is."
<br><br>Her presence.
<br><br>It caused frenzied voices to come from countless people in the arena.
<br><br>Finally, the time came.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan also slowly walked towards the ring under the attention of all the people.
