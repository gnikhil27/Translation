"Stupid fork!"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei said slowly, taking a few of the dogs with him, and slowly left to find his next true love.
<br><br>The original place.
<br><br>Long gone is Lv Xin for the trace.
<br><br>Only only vaguely see, the direction of the sky, a star flashed.
<br><br>I do not know how long ......
<br><br>The sky of the North Sea, there are objects landing at high speed and coming, like a meteorite falling from the sky, smashing down on the ground with a bang.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>After smashing down on the ground, was a fist knocked dumbfounded Lu Xinwei only to wake up, mouth mouth spitting blood at the same time, eyes flashing with a strong color of fear, staring eyes almost about to explode.
<br><br>Feeling his body all shattered bones and was shaken by the internal organs, Lu Xin for a large mouthful of breath, lying in the pit can not move, and hastily took out the transmission jade brief.
<br><br>"Quick, hurry up, come to the North Sea to pick me up, I want to go back, I want to go home!" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Opening the jade slip, he shouted.
<br><br>The old man who was thrown out of the window by Bone Ben Wei was not lightly injured, but thinking that his own lord was afraid that he would fight with Bone Ben Wei, so he hurried towards the restaurant regardless of his injury.
<br><br>But just halfway through the rush, he received a transmission jade slip from Lv Xinwei.
<br><br>"Great, my lord, how come you arrived at the North Sea in this moment?"
<br><br>The old man couldn't help but transmit back the jade slip.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Lv Xinwei almost exploded and growled, "Did I tell you to talk too much, hurry up and get over here."
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>Lv Xinwei lay in the pit, thinking back to the scene just now, still with palpitations.
<br><br>He understood that because of the superiority brought by the Lingxu Realm being stronger than the Xianjiang Continent, he had made the same mistake as Baiyang True Palace.
<br><br>The difference is that his luck was slightly better, he didn't die from such a punch.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>He also understood that this was the black-robed man's mercy.
<br><br>And this black-robed man's control of power was what made him feel the most terrifying, a punch that sent him to the North Sea and still not die, it was simply a fine thought.
<br><br>A few days later.
<br><br>The old man finally arrived.
<br><br>"Ya, my lord what's wrong with you?"
<br><br>The old man looked at Lu Xinwei who was lying in the pit, unable to move, and couldn't help but exclaim.
<br><br>"You shut up."
<br><br>Lv Xinwei glared and said, "Hurry up and carry me back to the Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>"Back to the Lingxu Realm?"
<br><br>The old man blinked and asked, "Isn't your lord going to subdue that black-robed man?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this.
<br><br>The already seriously injured Lv Xinwei's face twitched, almost did not die on the spot, pointed at the old man and cursed with hatred, "No wonder you are good in strength, yet no one wants you in the entire Lingxu Realm's forces, just you brainless thing, only I, Lv Xinwei, am blind to let you follow me."
<br><br>"Cut the crap, hurry up and carry me back to the Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>Speaking of which, Lu Xinwei really wanted to curse his mother.
<br><br>His tantalizing Xuan Xian cultivation, only a few days to the Immortal River continent, a total of two people concerned, but the damn two are unaffordable existence, one is more than a horror.
<br><br>The first person did not see, not to mention that he was a wooden sculpture almost a fist hiccup.
<br><br>The second black-robed man and a fist to beat him from the Central Continent to the North Sea.
<br><br>Also fucking collect subordinates it, not even smell a fart, and almost gave up his life.
<br><br>Especially the sand eagle who said there is no expert in the Immortal River continent, Lu Xinwei is really want to carry a knife to cut his whole family.
<br><br>More want to grab this forced to the two iron plate in front of see, this is the immortal river continent no expert.
<br><br>Anyway, Lv Xinwei just want to leave this place.
<br><br>This immortal river continent, too scary.
<br><br>It is best not to come here again for life.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The old man put Lu Xinwei behind his back and swept up into the air as a stream of light, flying towards the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>When he saw that he was going back to the Lingxu Realm, Lu Xinwei was relieved and the gloom in his heart dissipated.
<br><br>At this time, the old man said coldly: "By the way, my lord, you still haven't told me, how come you suddenly went from the Central Continent to the North Sea?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Lu Xinwei completely exploded.
<br><br>"I told you to talk too much, I told you to talk too much, go back and I will execute you!"
<br><br>On his back, he jumped up and knocked one chestnut towards the old man.
<br><br>But accidentally rubbed the already injured eggs, in mid-air painful wailing ......
