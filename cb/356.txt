"Phew, okay okay."
<br><br>With his head down, Black Feather breathed heavily, and his heart was secretly thankful.
<br><br>"Fortunately at the beginning of this immortal pretended to be a pussy, not directly, or now it's cold!"
<br><br>Just now his set of combinations seemingly flowing, but the heart panicked a group, the heart was also scared thumping.
<br><br>Just now Bone Ben Wei that finger to break the power of the thunderstorm, rhinoceros Lin they may not know what represents, but black feather heart is clear ah.
<br><br>The fact that he could do this means that Bone Ben Wei's strength is at least ten times stronger than his.
<br><br>Even more!
<br><br>Facing such a super expert, there is no half chance of victory.
<br><br>So in front of absolute strength, so what if you lose face, so what if you sell your teammates?
<br><br>Staying alive is the most important thing.
<br><br>However, black feather this act fell in the eyes of the three demons, so that the already injured them anger attack, directly a mouthful of blood spurted out. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The fire-breathing eyes stared deadly at Black Feather, full of hatred, full of reluctance.
<br><br>They never expected that at such a critical moment, their proud Lord Black Feather would actually fall back on the battlefield and become a licking dog.
<br><br>"Bah."
<br><br>"You traitor."
<br><br>"You traitor."
<br><br>Vicious voices came from the three demons.
<br><br>"Don't you all spout blood."
<br><br>Black feather immediately reddened his face and retorted: "You three demons wolf ambition is just, after the defeat of things you still want to drag me down, really so vicious ah!"
<br><br>"Lord Skeleton, Lord Dog, Lord Centipede, Lord Black Bear, please look into the situation and never believe the words of these three dog thieves, my Black Feather's heart can be seen in heaven and earth."
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"Thanks to you are still an emissary from the immortal world, or cultivation beyond the universal immortal to reach the golden immortal, hands occupied with blood of the great demon."
<br><br>"But did not expect that you have no credit at all, no backbone at all, you really disgrace the immortal world, disgrace your identity." Rhinoceros Lin angrily drank.
<br><br>Seeing this, Black Feather's heart suddenly panicked.
<br><br>In case this skeleton knows his identity, take him this what can be done?
<br><br>Thinking of this, black feather eyes suddenly moved, immediately stood up, justifiably retorted: "Put your mother's fart, when did I say I am the messenger of the immortal world, I am a small roc bird, usually drink dew and eat grass for a living, you do not want to blood spouting."
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>Rhinoceros forest three demons angry straight spit blood.
<br><br>However, looking at this dog bites dog four, Bone Ben Wei and others look full of impatience, said in a deep voice: "No one say who, are not good birds, one can not escape."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei this sentence, immediately scared black feather kneeled to the ground, with a crying voice shouted: "Lord, really, heaven and earth conscience, heaven and earth conscience ah!"
<br><br>Slap!
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei slapped Black Feather over to the ground, then kicked Black Bear's ass.
<br><br>"Xiao Si'er, get up."
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Where's the thunder?"
<br><br>"Where's the thunderbolt, I'm okay?"
<br><br>The black bear raised his head apprehensively and looked around at the sky, seeing a clear sky, an excited voice came out.
<br><br>"With this jagged man in, a small lightning is nothing, the sky fell, it is just a matter of a fist." Skeleton Ben Wei straightened his head.
<br><br>"Thank you brother, thank you brother, brother you are awesome."
<br><br>The black bear nodded his head with hot tears, then asked, "Then brother you call me, is there anything you need to order?"
<br><br>"Go, the four of them, a hundred slaps each." Bone Ben Wei pointed at the four black feathers and said.
<br><br>"This, not very good, right?"
<br><br>Black Bear lifted a pair of fleshy bear paws and said nervously.
<br><br>"Okay, there's nothing wrong."
<br><br>However, the black feather came out with an excited voice.
<br><br>Because since it was going to be a slap, it meant that Bone Ben Wei would probably not take his life.
<br><br>So this hundred slaps, if you can exchange this crisis relief and leave a life, this is not much at all.
<br><br>Moreover, this black bear looks naive, it is estimated that there is not much strength, this hundred slaps up, with his cultivation, really is not painful.
<br><br>The best!
<br><br>What a pleasure!
<br><br>So, he handed his face towards the black bear and shouted in his mouth, "I failed to see through the wolfish ambitions of those three demons in time, I am guilty, punishing a hundred slaps is no big deal, come on, hit me."
<br><br>"Is that really good?"
<br><br>The black bear moved the fleshy bear paw, still some can't bear to do it.
<br><br>"This is the order of Lord Skeleton, you have to hit, I have to take it, you go ahead and come the hardest." Black feather said in a hurry.
<br><br>"Then I will be harder?"
<br><br>Black Bear asked.
<br><br>"Use, by all means, greet me with the greatest force."
<br><br>Black Feather pressed his face closer again, while looking at Bone Ben Wei at the side with a flattering face, afraid that Bone Ben Wei would change his attention.
<br><br>"Okay, then I'll smoke."
<br><br>Seeing that Black Feather was so insistent, finally, Black Bear raised his fat bear paw and aimed it at Black Feather's face and smoked it.
<br><br>Looking at the incoming bear paw, black feather is quite a bit disappointed, disappointed that the force is not enough.
<br><br>In case the skeleton master saw the slap was not satisfied, changed his attention not to slap, instead to kill him, it would be a big deal.
<br><br>In his disappointed mood, black bear that slap finally, landed on his face.
<br><br>"Slap!"
