"What is it?"
<br><br>The two asked in unison, with a strong sense of urgency in their voices.
<br><br>"It's a scented capsule that says it's to repel insects." Li Renhao said.
<br><br>"Quick, take it out."
<br><br>The two men hurriedly said.
<br><br>But Li Renhao wanted to speak but stopped, stammered for half a day, then said with an ugly face: "At that time I thought he was a mortal, so this incense bag did not put in mind, I do not know when to lose."
<br><br>"What did you say?"
<br><br>The two Li Jiaxin's blood rushed straight to their brains, their auras exploded violently at this moment, their eyes staring deadly at Li Renhao.
<br><br>They never thought that the chance that others could not encounter even after a lifetime of exhausting and costly encounters would be thrown away by Li Renhao.
<br><br>"I ask you, where did you throw it?"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin with a trembling voice forced to ask, the tone and its urgency. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"I, I don't know, I really didn't mean to do it!" Li Renhao said with a stifled scalp, under the power of the two, she was under great pressure, and knew in her heart that Li Jiaxin and Xu Mozhu, who had always doted on her, were really angry this time.
<br><br>"I don't know, you actually don't know!?"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin raised her palm to hit over, but finally held back, red face looked at Li Renhao trembling and shouted: "Li Renhao ah Li Renhao, in vain you for my Li family, you do things how so confused ah!"
<br><br>"Do you know, your master and I, pay the cost of our Li family's space ring to get a chance, and you got a chance but threw it away, you are really good ah!"
<br><br>"Yes Jen well, this time not for my master to say you, do you know how big of a chance you threw away?" Xu Mozhu the same language excitedly scolded: "This senior is at least a Martial Saint expert, just now we and his contact, the Saint's treasure we saw two, and he gave you the incense bag, also likely to be a Saint's treasure, such a thing, you actually gave him lost, if not for the sake of you are my only disciple's sake, I would like to be righteous! "
<br><br>"A holy item?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's words instantly made Li Renhao's brain confused.
<br><br>Even seeing the excitement of her aunt and master both, but she did not guess towards the holy goods, after all, even a clan-quality treasure taken out is an existence that can set off a fishy storm, not to mention the holy goods?
<br><br>For a moment, she regretted her intestines, her eyes couldn't help the tears flowing down.
<br><br>"Master Aunt, I really know I'm wrong, I really didn't think this incense bag was so important, I thought it was just an ordinary incense bag used by a mortal!" Li Renhao shed tears and hurriedly explained.
<br><br>"Humph Li Renhao, you should know that this lost chance is not only yours alone, but also the Li family's and also the Royal Sword Sect's!" Li Jiaxin face covered with frost, painfully lectured: "Originally with this chance, you might be able to lead the Imperial Sword Sect and our Li Family to another level, but you, actually lost it."
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>Under the attack of anger, Li Jiaxin's chest was stuffy and a mouthful of blood was vomited out directly.
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Renhao's face became even more anxious, while shedding tears, she hurriedly said, "Auntie, don't be angry, I'll go look for it, I'll definitely get it back."
<br><br>"What are you looking for to find, the holy product is a treasure that has reached the point of returning to the basics, it simply does not give off any breath fluctuations, only by looking closely can you feel the true meaning of it." Li Jiaxin scolded: "And there are so many mountains in this Makufu Mountain, so what do you take alone to find?"
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Li Renhao lowered her head, choking half a sentence, at this moment she really does not know what to do.
<br><br>If I had known that this incense bag is so important, how would she be so not put on the heart, blame can only blame their own eyes do not know the goods!
<br><br>"Forget it, it's better to look for the fragrance bag first." At this time, Xu Mozhu said with a blue face, "I plan to go back and mobilize all the disciples of my Royal Sword Sect to come into the mountain to look for this fragrance bag."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth and understood that the fragrance bag was more important than teaching Li Renhao a lesson, so she also hurriedly said, "I will also go back to inform the Li family and send people to search together."
<br><br>"Then there is no time to lose, let's move immediately, just hope, this fragrance bag can still be found!"
