Respectfully but elegantly, Black Feather bowed towards Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>When Su Xuanjun saw Black Feather, he couldn't help but glare at the crowd below the field and said in a deep voice, "How about it, those who said Black Feather had defected, what else do you have to say?"
<br><br>At that, the crowd lowered their heads and were silent.
<br><br>"As I said, Black Feather is absolutely loyal to me, if any of you chew on me again in the future, get the hell out of the Green Jade Immortal Continent."
<br><br>Only after saying that, Su Xuanjun turned his gaze to Black Feather and waved his hand, a gentle power pervaded out and lifted up the kneeling Black Feather.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the continent master."
<br><br>Black Feather said respectfully, "Thank you also for the trust the continental lord has placed in me, I am bound to work hard to make our Green Jade Immortal Continent even more, glorious!"
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun looked up to the sky and laughed, said trustingly: "You, I am relieved, after all, with me for more than ten thousand years, who rebelled against me, you will not rebel."
<br><br>"But back to the topic, or to talk about, this time why did you dragged so long down to the world?" Su Xuanjun asked again, "Could it be that you ran into something tricky?"
<br><br>"Not bad, the big change that did occur in that Immortal River Continent." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Black Feather frowned and said gruffly, "And I came back this time to ask for help."
<br><br>"Oh, a pigsty-like lower realm, what kind of change has happened that you are actually unable to set things right even for a Golden Immortal and have to come back to ask for help?" Su Xuanjun frowned, his expression full of disbelief.
<br><br>The other experts in the field also cast their eyes over.
<br><br>"As you know, Lord Continent, once the Immortal River Continent was an independent realm, and the realm level was also much more advanced than today."
<br><br>Black Feather said, "It was only later that the Immortal River Continent started a dispute and a top-level war took place, breaking many of the laws of the Immortal River Continent hard, before it broke down to the low level of today."
<br><br>"Not bad, the Immortal River Continent does have such a history."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun nodded and asked, "Just that, does it have anything to do with this incident?"
<br><br>"Of course it's related, the root cause of this incident happened right in the middle of the battlefield ruins of that Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"Because many great powers died in that battlefield ruins, after countless years of evolution, some dead powerful souls gathered together and gave birth to a new kind of death spirit."
<br><br>"The strength of these dead spirits directly broke the rules of the Immortal River Continent, and also broke the Immortal Irrigation that you sealed away."
<br><br>"And when I scouted there, I was besieged by the dead spirits in that relic, and I fought alone against the eight dead spirits for seven days and seven nights, and several times I was going to die there."
<br><br>"But I thought about it, I can not die ah, I shouldered the Lord of the continent to give me a heavy responsibility ah, I must come back to tell the Lord of the continent what happened there ah, otherwise if you let these dead spirits grow up, will certainly become the Lord of the continent big trouble ah!
<br><br>"Just like that, I held such a belief, hard to hold on, and finally with my some means to escape out."
<br><br>Black feather face solemnly explained.
<br><br>The face is even with some sighs and heart palpitations.
<br><br>That after the robbery, look at the crowd present are trust to the extreme, as if they were there, many people are for black feather pinch a sweat.
<br><br>"For my Green Jade Immortal Continent, hard work you."
<br><br>And Su Xuanjun even heavily patted Black Feather's shoulder, emitting a gratifying voice: "Next you just rest, eat and drink well, do not care about anything, as for the Immortal River Continent, leave things to me."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Black Feather, however, refused outright.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>His voice was decisive as he said, "You are busy with affairs, how can you personally worry about such things, you only need to send some reinforcements to me, I will bring my men and horses and immediately rejoin the Immortal River Continent to eliminate hidden dangers for you, Lord of the Continent."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Hearing Hei Yu's words, Su Xuanjun was extremely relieved, and even more so, he couldn't help but sigh, "With this great general of yours, it's really a great fortune for my Qingyu Immortal Continent, a great fortune for me, Su Xuanjun!"
<br><br>After saying that, he glared at the others in the field.
<br><br>"Look at the Black Feather Golden Immortal, and look at yourselves, are you ashamed?"
<br><br>"The Black Feather Golden Immortal has worked hard for my Green Jade Immortal Continent, while you guys are chewing behind your backs, can you live with yourselves in your hearts?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's words made all the people present blush and lowered their heads for a long time, not daring to speak.
<br><br>"Black Feather Golden Immortal."
<br><br>"Present."
<br><br>"Since you are so righteous for my Green Jade Immortal Continent, then I order you to pick any of my Immortal Continent experts and go down to the world to put an end to the hidden problem of the dead spirits!" Su Xuanjun said loudly.
<br><br>"Yes, my subordinate is bound to complete the task."
<br><br>"Just before I leave, I have two more requests!"
<br><br>Black Feather said.
<br><br>"Good, whatever difficulties you have, just tell me, I will solve them for you." Su Xuanjun said atmospherically.
<br><br>"Here's what I think, if I want to kill them all, I need to set up an ambush to lure them out."
<br><br>"That's why I need some immortal grade pills as bait." Black Feather said, "But don't worry, Lord of the Continent, I won't use them privately, I will only use them as bait."
<br><br>"Immortal grade elixirs?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun frowned, but after a moment of hesitation, he agreed.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the continent master."
<br><br>Black Feather's face was slightly pleased as he continued, "These dead spirits are difficult to kill them directly because they are souls, so I would also like to borrow the Immortal Soul Regent Blade of the Continent Lord."
<br><br>"With the Soul Regent Blade, we will be able to kill them easily and also kill two birds with one stone because the Soul Regent Blade absorbs the souls of these dead spirits and is also able to gain great benefits."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun was silent this time.
<br><br>Immortal grade pills were already unavailable treasures, and even as the lord of a continent, he did not have much.
<br><br>But even so, he still agreed to Black Feather.
<br><br>But the Soul Regent Blade was different.
<br><br>It was the most powerful one among the limited number of immortal weapons he had in his hand, and it had never left his side.
<br><br>However, after he took a look at the loyal Black Feather, he still gritted his teeth and agreed.
<br><br>After all, the subordinates had all given so much for his Green Jade Immortal Continent, and if he didn't lend this immortal weapon again, it would inevitably chill the hearts of his subordinates.
<br><br>"Many thanks to the continent master."
<br><br>Black Feather was overjoyed.
<br><br>After getting the immortal grade pills and the Soul Regent Blade, Black Feather picked a group of demonic beasts without stopping and immediately went down to the world.
