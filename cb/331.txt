"Thank you very much, sir."
<br><br>The three people thanked each other.
<br><br>The hearts were extremely excited.
<br><br>Of course the excitement wasn't because of the meal.
<br><br>Because at their cultivation level, it didn't matter what they ate, the key was to eat but to be able to get closer to this one better.
<br><br>"Disciple, go grab some medicinal herbs."
<br><br>Yi Feng wrote out a prescription and threw it to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>While in the martial arts school Yi Feng also began to get busy, squatting on the side to pick up vegetables.
<br><br>"It seems that Mr. is really into the mortal to the extreme ah, everything personally, I'm afraid that really is called a true return to the basics!"
<br><br>Ye Bei could not help but sigh.
<br><br>"Yes, if it were not for this martial arts school full of treasures, I'm afraid I would really think he was a mortal." Shake Heavenly Que also sighed with emotion, "This, is the realm of the true high man!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"All right, all right, you two master and disciple do not blow, hurry up to find work, do we really sit and wait for dinner?" Guan Yunpeng said in a good-natured way.
<br><br>Master and apprentice two hastened to respond.
<br><br>So the three of them raised their sleeves in style and started to help: "Sir, do you need any help?"
<br><br>"That's really a lot of trouble for you guys."
<br><br>Yi Feng just a little busy, while the large pile of bullwhip thrown in the basin, while saying: "This bullwhip, please help you guys clean it!"
<br><br>Looking at this cow whip, the three people were stagnant.
<br><br>"This whip, it's too big!"
<br><br>Although they had never seen such a large whip, but they did not dare to say anything, and hurriedly cleaned.
<br><br>But peeled away a look, the three people were immediately scared trembling.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"This one is, is connected meridians?"
<br><br>"It seems that inside this meridian, there is still the un-dissipated Yuan Qi!"
<br><br>"What in the end is left behind, this part has aura, and it has not dissipated even after being dead for so long!"
<br><br>"It's even better dense."
<br><br>The three people's faces were greatly shocked.
<br><br>Especially when the Yuan Qi left in that meridian leaked out, it brought an invisible sense of oppression to the three people.
<br><br>In addition to being dense, this Yuan Qi was also very pure.
<br><br>So pure that they did not dare to imagine.
<br><br>The three people immediately understood that this was not an ordinary bullwhip at all, but a demonic beast with a powerful cultivation.
<br><br>From the purity of this leftover Yuan Qi, the three men initially guessed that it was at least an emperor level demonic beast as well.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>At the thought of this, the three people became short of breath, and their eyes almost stared off.
<br><br>What a fucking gesture!
<br><br>Using a Demon Emperor level whip to supplement the body was simply unthinkable.
<br><br>The three people who were not too interested in eating per se, secretly swore in their hearts that they would drink two more bowls later on.
<br><br>The demon emperor level whip, for them is certainly also a great tonic.
<br><br>In this life, I'm afraid that only by following a high achiever like Yi Feng can they have such a mouthful.
<br><br>Not long after, Yi Feng grabbed the herbs and came back. Yi Feng threw the washed bullwhip with the herbs into a pot and simmered it up.
<br><br>Soon after, the beef whip soup has given off a fragrance.
<br><br>Ye Bei three people looking at the pot, already began to gulp.
<br><br>They understood that if this dry bowl of soup went down, it was bound to be more beneficial than what they had gotten from drinking tea before.
<br><br>"I'll get two bowls for my disciple first."
<br><br>Yi Feng gave two or two bowls to Zhong Qing who was boxing after buying medicine.
<br><br>"Thanks a lot, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded good-naturedly toward Yi Feng, then said, "But Master, after the soup I have to go out, Miss Bai is still waiting for me outside."
<br><br>"What is she waiting for you for?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"She said there is a way for me to cultivate, so she told me to go to her daily." Zhong Qing said, "So that after I become a cultivator, I can protect Master."
<br><br>"Good disciple, Master didn't love you for nothing."
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed Zhong Qing's head and knew how much Zhong Qing yearned for cultivation, so he didn't refuse.
<br><br>After drinking two bowls of soup, Zhong Qing's forehead immediately began to sweat, and his face became much rosy.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>This was just a normal phenomenon of drinking soup, so the two of them didn't care too much.
<br><br>After finishing the soup, Zhong Qing ran outside.
<br><br>The martial arts school was a few miles away.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi stood at the entrance of the courtyard, staring into the distance.
<br><br>Old Taoist Lin Mo suddenly appeared and asked leisurely, "How is the progress?"
<br><br>"In recent times, my relationship with him has become better and better, and he no longer resists me." Bai Lengxi raised the corner of his mouth and said with a smile.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Lin Mo Lao Dao nodded, remembered something, and asked again, "But this matter, still can't make a mistake, so you really confirm that he is a divine body?"
<br><br>"Ten thousand percent confirmed."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi said confidently: "His divine body has been able to appear characteristics and visions under the stimulation of my spiritual qi during this period of time, if you don't believe me, he will come to me later, I will inject special spiritual qi into him, and a golden phantom will emerge from the top of his head."
<br><br>"Well, well, then I'd like to see what's so different about a Godly body that is blessed with heaven!"
<br><br>Old Daoist Lin Mo stroked his beard, his face full of expectation.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>Zhong Qing beat a trot and came this way.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi raised the corner of his mouth with a smile and asked leisurely, "You're here?"
<br><br>"Mm."
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded, then lifted his head and asked, "Are you really, able to let me cultivate?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Bai Lengxi replied confidently.
<br><br>If the divine body could not be cultivated, then in this world, there would be no more cultivators.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>Old Daoist Lin Mo threw a wink at Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi understood, her palm gently fell on Zhong Qing's shoulder, and a stream of spiritual energy was silently injected into it.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Old Taoist Lin Mo stared straight ahead, expecting the vision to happen.
<br><br>But most of the day passed, Zhong Qing's body still did not appear half a vision.
<br><br>Old Taoist Lin Mo turned his puzzled gaze to Bai Lengxi.
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face was also furiously anxious, obviously not knowing why this was the case, anxiously she injected another stream of spiritual energy into Zhong Qing's body.
<br><br>However, after waiting, there was still no vision happening.
<br><br>"How could this happen?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face gradually became pale.
<br><br>At first, Zhong Qing was a very recessive divine body, and only when she stayed by Zhong Qing's side and made daily contact and then added spiritual qi to stimulate it, could the hidden divine body be released.
<br><br>And before Zhong Qing had returned to the martial arts school, she had already succeeded in using her aura to catalyze Zhong Qing's divine body vision, which was enough to mean that Zhong Qing was the divine body.
<br><br>And after prodding it once, the hidden divine body was completely unlocked, so later, as long as Bai Lengxi prodded it with her aura, she would definitely release the divine body vision.
<br><br>Even just this morning, she even hypnotized successfully.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>Just one meal's time, then there was an accident.
<br><br>This caused her to panic instantly.
<br><br>She did not care about anything else, and once again used her spiritual energy to stimulate.
<br><br>But there was still no movement.
<br><br>"No, no, no, what the hell is going on here?" Bai Lengxi stumbled back on her feet, and her jade hand grabbed directly onto Zhong Qing's wrist.
<br><br>Swish!
<br><br>Instantly.
<br><br>Her face became bloodless.
<br><br>This was because she discovered that the meridian structure within Zhong Qing's body had changed.
<br><br>It had turned into a kind of meridian structure that she could not understand at all.
<br><br>And this structure was not at all the same kind of meridian structure that was used during the previous divine body vision.
<br><br>In other words.
<br><br>Today's Zhong Qing, no longer has a divine body!
<br><br>At this moment, Bai Lengxi directly panicked and could no longer remain calm, grabbing Zhong Qing and asking hysterically, "I'm asking you, what exactly did you do?"
<br><br>"I... I... I didn't do anything, huh?" The dumbfounded Zhong Qing looked at Bai Lengxi aggrievedly, completely confused that Bai Lengxi would suddenly become like this.
<br><br>"Let me ask you, have you ever come into contact with anyone?" Bai Lengxi asked again.
<br><br>"No, just my master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing responded confusedly.
<br><br>"Your master?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi snorted coldly, that mortal waste could not have the means to change the divine body, so he asked again, "Then have you eaten anything?"
<br><br>"Drank two bowls of bullwhip soup!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing said.
<br><br>"Bull whip soup?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi's face turned cold as his aura entered Zhong Qing's body again.
<br><br>Sure enough, inside Zhong Qing's body, there was a warm current, and it was this warm current that was changing the structure of Zhong Qing's meridians and changing his physique at the same time.
<br><br>She instantly determined that the problem was in the so-called "bullwhip soup".
<br><br>"I ask you, who gave you this bullwhip soup?"
<br><br>Bai Lengxi asked with a cold face.
<br><br>"My master, is there a problem?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing asked with a stern face.
<br><br>"Damn mortal!"
<br><br>"Spoiling my good deeds."
<br><br>With a cold shout, Bai Lengxi erupted with icy coldness.
<br><br>At this moment, don't mention how furious she was in her heart.
<br><br>It was so hard to find a divine body, and she had wasted so much time to confirm the approach, but at this most crucial moment, the divine body disappeared.
<br><br>Wouldn't this be the same as, all her efforts were wasted?
<br><br>Under the anger, she drew her sword and instantly disappeared in the same place, and then followed the martial arts school to kill.
