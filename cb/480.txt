Wu Chang'an was surprised beyond belief.
<br><br>This skill comes from a hot spoof anime of Blue Star, and is the exclusive skill of one of the characters.
<br><br>As the name implies.
<br><br>As long as the person flies out the sword, the target will be uncontrollably kneeling on the ground with empty hands to catch the white blade.
<br><br>Is a passive super control skills.
<br><br>Because it controls the person's chance is 100 percent.
<br><br>It can be said that although this skill is odd, it is definitely considered a divine skill.
<br><br>Imagine if someone cooperated with him and the enemy was controlled empty-handed to catch a white blade, then the enemy at this time, is not the fish meat on the chopping block?
<br><br>Time this shake.
<br><br>It is half a year has passed.
<br><br>Heaven and earth door lively a lot. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>As Yi Feng previously completed the achievement point of receiving ten apprentices, a slightly more reliable system, and presented thirty flyers.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>With the help of this flyer, together with the people previously collected, Yi Feng's disciples have grown to twenty-nine people.
<br><br>Only.
<br><br>These disciples, it seemed that none of them had much interest in cultivation.
<br><br>"Speechless ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng lay on the recliner and continued to live his salted fish life.
<br><br>This is also good, he was afraid that these disciples were begging him for cultivation and gongfu every day.
<br><br>"Xiao Si'er ah, go, pick some beans, make a sour beans fried rice to eat." Yi Feng said toward the side of the Chi a bucket.
<br><br>"Okay, Master."
<br><br>Chiyi bucket carried the basket of vegetables and left.
<br><br>He walked all the way towards the back of the mountain.
<br><br>On the way, he bumped into four imposing black-robed men, lying leisurely on the grass, chasing after the jade poof group that was playing in the jade brief.
<br><br>"Greetings to the four handsome guardians!"
<br><br>Chi Yat Bucket hurriedly saluted.
<br><br>"Yada yada yada, little fatty, still this resourceful, go go go."
<br><br>The Great Protector gave him a satisfied look, and then waved his hand.
<br><br>Chi-yi-bucket walked all the way through.
<br><br>He joined the Heaven and Earth Sect three months ago, not a disciple of Yi Feng, and said that he was looking for some spiritual food, so he became a floor sweeper in the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>Only at this moment he is behaving a little strange, is turning his back to the outside, facing the corner siddhis.
<br><br>"Good day, monk Kunpeng."
<br><br>Chiyi Bucket greeted politely.
<br><br>"Good and good."
<br><br>The sweeping monk quickly put away the books in his hands, tidied his robe, and turned back to put up his hands in a dignified manner.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Late a bucket came to the vegetable field in the back of the mountain.
<br><br>There, there was a young man wearing a straw hat, carefully repairing his vegetables.
<br><br>"Fourteen ah, what are you doing?" Chi-yi-bucket shouted.
<br><br>"So it's Fourth Senior Brother."
<br><br>The straw hat youth Shen Nong, who is ranked fourteenth, turned around and smiled gently and said softly, "Bugs have recently started on this vegetable, these bugs are afraid that they have the cultivation level of a demon emperor, so I'll clean it up, if not, these bugs are afraid that they will become immortal."
<br><br>"Oh, then you continue to clean it, I will pick some beans for the master, he wants to eat beans fried rice." Chiyi Bucket said.
<br><br>"No problem, not to mention the master, the master brothers if you need anything just say so." Shen Nong said gently.
<br><br>"En, senior brother also feel free to tell me what you want to eat."
<br><br>Chi a bucket equally gentle response.
<br><br>"By the way fourth senior brother, thirteenth senior brother seems to have something to ask you, you go there." Shen Nong crushed a few worms in his hand, while saying towards Chi Yi Pail.
<br><br>"Then I'll go, so please help me pick beans!"
<br><br>Chi a bucket crotch moving short thick legs, round body suddenly towards the far side of the run.
<br><br>Not far away, a young man was carrying a building block made from divine Heaven Xuan Iron, and the building block was now in his hands, built into a magnificent palace.
<br><br>Even if it was only a model, one could see its grandeur, as well as the various subtle designs in it.
<br><br>"Thirteen ah, looking for me what is it."
<br><br>Chiyi barrel shouted.
<br><br>The youth who built the model also had a slightly fat figure, and he was ranked thirteenth in the Heaven and Earth Sect, named Tsukiyama.
<br><br>Hearing the shout of Chi Yibu, he raised his head and said: "Fourth Brother, you are finally here, some time ago, seventh Brother Jia Jia Qin inoculated a batch of chickens, said that when grown up, can be given to the brothers as mounts, each one, the day you are closed to make crayfish, so did not bother you, seventh Brother will belong to you that chickens put me here, you quickly take it! "
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Tsukiyama raised two small chicken boys, both of which had seven-colored feathers on them.
<br><br>"By the way, bring one to the master as well, although I don't know if he needs it." Tsukiyama said.
<br><br>"Forget it for the master."
<br><br>"I'd better bring his one directly to the kitchen and fry it for him." Chi a bucket said, "Last time the old seven inoculated out of that mutant pig, let the master roasted, he can not see this thing."
<br><br>"Also, then fry it, if the master needs, fry my one is fine, big deal, I will ask the seventh senior brother to match one out for me."
<br><br>Speaking of this, reverence flashed in the eyes of Tsukiyama.
<br><br>"It's okay, one is enough, not enough I can also fry this one for the master." Chi a barrel smiled, looked back at the mountain and asked, "What is the sixth senior sister doing lately, so long not see her?"
<br><br>"Seems to be memorizing pi backwards, honestly, fourth senior brother if you have time to get more food to the sixth sister to make up for it, she that mathematics to learn than our brain, but compared to our line, the ceiling is also much higher, in the future there are outstanding brothers and sisters, she can certainly count one."
<br><br>"Of course, we can not be too bad, out always can not lose the face of the master."
<br><br>Tsukiyama said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"That's right."
<br><br>Chi a bucket solemnly nodded, then said, "Well thirteen, you have a good time busy you, I go back to the master cooking."
<br><br>After running around and retrieving the vegetable basket, Chiyi Bucket was already tired and panting.
<br><br>Good thing.
<br><br>I ran into a reader who was riding a green ox backwards.
<br><br>"Goose goose goose, bend your neck and sing to the sky ......"
<br><br>The reader ranked eleven, named Li Tai Bai, with a three-foot green blade hidden in his sleeve, riding a bull while shaking his head and reciting the verses in his mouth.
<br><br>"Old eleven ah, quick, let you this cow give me a ride, senior brother I can not run." Chiyi barrel shouted.
<br><br>"So it is the fourth senior brother."
<br><br>"It's okay to ride the ox, is there any wine?"
<br><br>The reader smiled gently.
<br><br>"Your fourth senior brother can still forget you?" Chiyi Bucket gave him a white look and threw a gourd over.
<br><br>"Good wine, good wine." The reader lifted the lid and took a sniff, immediately revealing an intoxicated look, his palm outstretched, pulling Chi Yat Bucket onto the green ox.
<br><br>The green ox slowly walked toward the kitchen.
<br><br>Shortly after.
<br><br>A bowl of fragrant fried rice with bean curd was brought.
<br><br>It made Yi Feng feel quite satisfied.
<br><br>"Please see the master."
<br><br>Just then, a young man dressed in plain clothes came and knelt down on the ground and said respectfully, "Master, I have something at home and need to go back, I hope Master will approve."
<br><br>"Oh, how many rows are you, what's your name?"
<br><br>Yi Feng put down fried rice, although he had an impression of this disciple, but only just arrived, he did not know at all what the ranking, and even forgot the name.
<br><br>"Report to the master, the disciple ranked twenty-eight, named Xiao Zhan!"
<br><br>The youth said respectfully.
<br><br>"Oh, twenty-eight, what is your family so anxious to go back?" Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Report to the master, my disciple's family has a marriage contract, but the woman saw that my family's dao has fallen, and dislike my talent is not good enough, so they came to my home to force, to withdraw from my marriage." Xiao Zhan's eyes faintly flickered out a trace of gloom and pain, bowed his head and said.
<br><br>"Withdrawal of marriage?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>This thing naturally pulls hatred ah.
<br><br>His own disciple was withdrawn from the marriage, he is the master, at least have to do something ah!
<br><br>"This way, go home can, I will send a few more division brothers to help you."
<br><br>Yi Feng is also afraid that the child is in trouble, more people can also be more care, so he turned back towards Su Yunyun behind him and instructed, "Apprentice ah, you accompany twenty-eight personally go, and call a few more people."
<br><br>"Yes, Master."
<br><br>Su Yunyun nodded her head respectfully.
<br><br>At the same time, a cold aura flashed in her eyes.
<br><br>Dare to bully her senior brother, simply do not want to die.
<br><br>And Xiao Zhan's eyes also lit up.
<br><br>He himself was a person who had no cultivation and had just started and had not learned anything yet, so he did not have half the strength to go back on this trip.
<br><br>But now can call on a few brothers, although do not know how their strength, but always let his heart more comfort.
