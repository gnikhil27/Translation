"You're actually not intact anymore?"
<br><br>The old man stared at Ao Qingcheng, trembling, and said word by word.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, he attacked his heart with anxious fire, his chest tightened and a mouthful of blood spat out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>And this sentence of the old man fell in the hall, like an explosive thunder rang out, and it immediately raised a thousand waves.
<br><br>Each and every strong person with a profound aura stood up one after another, ironically, and gathered a pinhole-like gaze towards Ao Qingcheng.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The aura on Ao Qingcheng's body was completely different from before.
<br><br>The complete jade.
<br><br>No longer!
<br><br>"How could this happen?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yes, a good trip out, how did it turn out like this?"
<br><br>"Didn't they say they were looking for Ao Qing, what the hell happened."
<br><br>A heavy voice came out, obviously unable to accept this fact.
<br><br>Because Ao Qingcheng is the collective hope of these people, in order to cultivate her, all do not know how much resources have been spent on Ao Qingcheng's body, how much blood money has been put down.
<br><br>But did not expect that when they were about to reap the benefits, such a thing happened.
<br><br>"Qingcheng, you speak, you speak!" After the old man spat out a mouthful of blood, he asked Ao Qingcheng with a face full of anxiety.
<br><br>However, the vacant-eyed Ao Qingcheng, as if she did not hear the old man's words, just quietly shed tears and did not move a muscle.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>The old man's trembling palm pointed at Ao Qingcheng, angry and unable to say half a word, helpless, could only look at Ao Qingcheng's men.
<br><br>"You say."
<br><br>He questioned one of them.
<br><br>"Lord Bi Fang Demon Sect, I, I I I ......"
<br><br>That subordinate was sweating and stammered for half a day unable to say a single word.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang slapped him to death, grabbed another person with one hand, and drank in a deep voice: "You say, say or die!"
<br><br>"I I I, I say, I say ......"
<br><br>"Yes, it's Ao Qing, it's Ao Qing who defiled the holy maiden."
<br><br>Under Ao Bi Fang's intimidating pressure, this subordinate finally couldn't bear the pressure and told the truth.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Once his words fell, they set off shocking waves in the hall at once.
<br><br>What's more, it almost shocked the jaws of the crowd.
<br><br>Although they guessed all sorts of surprises, but how could they not guess Ao Qing, the head of this waste.
<br><br>He Red Sun lineage, the pride of heaven daughter of the Demon Emperor realm, was actually given ...... by Ao Qing, the most wasteful and unpopular of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan
<br><br>Grassed!
<br><br>"You're talking about that trash Ao Qing? Did I mishear, or did you say it wrong?" Ao Bi Fang gripped the subordinate's neck tightly and drank in a deep voice: "Tell me quickly, what is going on?"
<br><br>"Lord Demon Sect, I really didn't lie to you, it was really Ao Qing's doing!"
<br><br>This subordinate didn't dare to hide, and firstly, he roughly told the cause and effect of the incident, and then he detailed what happened in the martial school.
<br><br>"Demon subduing mirror, how can there be a demon subduing mirror, how can two mortals have a demon subduing mirror?" Ao Bi Fang's face flashed with incredulity, then grabbed him and asked, "I ask you, are you really sure that those two people have no cultivation?"
<br><br>"A thousand percent sure!"
<br><br>The subordinate hurriedly said, "Ask them if you don't believe me."
<br><br>Seeing this, the other subordinates also hurriedly nodded their heads.
<br><br>At these words, Ao Bi Fang clenched his fists tightly, his hatred climbing up.
<br><br>"Ao Qing, mortals, I want you to die ......"
<br><br>Gnashing his teeth, his voice shook the great hall, followed by him passing out orders.
<br><br>"Where are the two demon clans of Fu Dao, Xiu Luo."
<br><br>"Present!"
<br><br>As his voice fell, in the hall, two men with profound aura came out.
<br><br>"You two quickly rush to that martial hall, bring back Ao Qing at the same time, then raze that martial hall to the ground, I don't care if those two people are mortals, I also want you to bring back their heads!" Ao Bi Fang's cold voice slowly fell, and then with a wave of his palm, a large black umbrella appeared in his hand again.
<br><br>"Remember, bring the umbrella to cover the sky, with it, the demon subduing mirror will not pose a threat to you!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Receiving the umbrella, the two main demon sect experts of Fu Dao Xiu Luo immediately stepped into the air and left.
<br><br>After ordering everything, Ao Bi Fang looked at Ao Qingcheng again, remembering that so many years of hard work was wasted by Ao Qing, this waste, he shouted again: "The rest of you, follow me to the Heaven Devouring Hall!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Rolling voice fell, countless figures swept out quickly.
<br><br>Devouring Heaven Hall.
<br><br>It was the place where Heaven Devouring Emperor Ao Zhong handled the affairs of the clan, and it was also the place where he slept.
<br><br>"Madam, one of our three sons is more useless than the other, why don't we make another one?" Heaven Devouring Emperor Ao Zhong smilingly said towards a beautiful woman in front of him.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>However, the beautiful woman pushed him away and said sorrowfully, "You have three sons, but I only have Qing'er, and you know that Qing'er was framed, you still chastised him and expelled him from the tribe, if he does anything outside, I will not spare you."
<br><br>"Alas madam, this really can't be helped, you know that the red sun lineage eyeing, afraid of not catching our handle, I also have no choice ah!" Ao Zhong sighed and said with a helpless face: "And Qing'er has not been progressive, and has never experienced trials and tribulations, I also happen to take this opportunity to refine him ah!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Madam Yun Evening Qing, however, was not impressed.
<br><br>"Madam I swear, as soon as the situation in the clan is stable, I will definitely bring Qing'er back!" Ao Zhong raised his palm, then said with a smile, "Besides, don't you want Qing'er to have more siblings or something?"
<br><br>Yun Wanqing gave Ao Zhong a sultry glance before not pushing back again.
<br><br>Ao Zhong's face was happy and he was about to bring his gun to the battlefield.
<br><br>However, he had his pants down, but outside came a shout with a strong sense of anger.
<br><br>"Devouring Heavenly Emperor, please come out to us immediately!"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Ao Zhong's face changed.
<br><br>"Damn Red Sun lineage, not only did you cause my Qing'er to be expelled from the tribe, but you also want to suppress my royal lineage on all fronts to prevent me from making it?"
<br><br>"How can I let you have your way!"
<br><br>Said, Ao Zhong looked at his wife, a gnashing of teeth, directly seconds!
<br><br>Then, under his wife's sultry gaze, his body aura revealed, stepping out into the air towards Ao Bi Fang and others swept away.
