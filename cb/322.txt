Finished speaking.
<br><br>Yin and Yang double old man left with a disdainful face.
<br><br>Yi Feng had a black face.
<br><br>Two dead old men, cross what cross?
<br><br>Mouth shut mortal, at this time speak as if who is more noble than who seems to be, if not want to save some strength, certainly two brick moving directly shoot you dead.
<br><br>After the separation, Yi Feng took Yun Yaoyao two people embarked on the journey.
<br><br>But Lone Wunian's heart is still not solid.
<br><br>Although he did not mean to look down on Yi Feng, but also as Yin Yang double old man said, hall a martial emperor, will be the hope of life on a mortal, always feel a little rash.
<br><br>"Miss Yun, he, can he really be trusted?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian walked beside Yun Yoyo and couldn't help but ask in a lowered voice.
<br><br>"Although I am not very sure either, but I still trust him more than those two old men." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao said solemnly.
<br><br>In fact, her heart was also slightly complicated.
<br><br>Martial Emperor.
<br><br>As the peak battle power of the entire Immortal River Continent, they possessed their own pride.
<br><br>She also did not expect that she would repeatedly place her hopes on a mortal.
<br><br>Time flashed.
<br><br>It was seven days.
<br><br>These seven days down, all three people became weak beyond measure.
<br><br>"I can't, I can't walk anymore."
<br><br>Behind them, Lone Wunian supported the long Jian in his hand, dragging his heavy feet, and said with a miserable white face.
<br><br>"Yes, Yi Feng, take a rest."
<br><br>Yun Yuyao's face was equally pale as she said towards Yi Feng in front of her.
<br><br>Without cultivation, they may have a much stronger body strength than ordinary people, but their bodies can't hold up without supplies by now.
<br><br>"Well, then, rest for a quarter of an hour."
<br><br>Yi Feng, who walked in front of the path of exploration, nodded.
<br><br>The brow, too, was tightly frowned.
<br><br>Originally thought that along the way, they could still occasionally encounter some beasts, or demonic beasts that were also suppressed in cultivation, so that they could at least ensure their supplies.
<br><br>But these days down the road, not a single live thing.
<br><br>What appeared in front of them were only passages and stone walls, which was a huge torture for everyone's psyche.
<br><br>The only consolation was that they still had enough drinking water in their hands, but water alone, without food, wouldn't last long.
<br><br>"It's time to go."
<br><br>A quarter of an hour later, Yi Feng got up and said to them.
<br><br>At that, the two people who were about to fall asleep had a bitter look on their faces, looking at the white robe in front of them that even had a hint of scholarly temperament, filled with complexity.
<br><br>They really could not understand.
<br><br>They two martial emperors are about to hold on, Yi Feng as a mortal, in the end where to come so much potential?
<br><br>Lone Wunian, in particular, licked his dry tongue and said breathlessly, "Brother Yi, I really don't have the strength, so why don't you two go first."
<br><br>"If you don't go, you will die here."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him and said seriously.
<br><br>He also understood very well that tripping down would be comfortable, but lying down would definitely not get up.
<br><br>"But, I really don't have any half strength."
<br><br>Lone Wunian said with an ugly face.
<br><br>"You guys get up and go, I promise to let you eat after half a day." Yi Feng said with a firm expression.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Both Yun Yaoyao's and Lone Wunian's eyes lit up, and the gaze they looked at Yi Feng was full of incredulity.
<br><br>"I promise."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head firmly.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The two did not know where the strength came from, climbed up and followed Yi Feng to continue the journey.
<br><br>Just like that, another half day passed.
<br><br>Seeing that Lone Wunian and Yun Yuyao were about to fall down, Yi Feng took a step, took out his pocket, and took out a piece of beef jerky.
<br><br>Evenly divide it into three pieces.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, you actually have beef jerky here?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian's eyes glittered as he took the beef jerky and ate it wolfishly, and even Yun Yoyao, who was on the side, did not have much decency.
<br><br>After they finished eating, they saw that the two of them looked much better.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, where did you get this dried beef from?" Lone Wunian asked again in a hurry.
<br><br>"This is what I had left over from before, but there's not much left." Yi Feng took out another piece of beef jerky and said, "There is only this piece left."
<br><br>Looking at this piece of dried beef, Lone Wunian couldn't help but lick his tongue and said expectantly, "Brother Yi you are really great, this piece of dried beef must be able to last us a few more days."
<br><br>On the side, Yun Yuyao also looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Above her pretty face, a touch of hope appeared.
<br><br>Time passed slowly.
<br><br>It was another few days.
<br><br>The last piece of beef jerky, finally, was also eaten by the three people ......
<br><br>But always, there was no return to that big hall.
<br><br>"This time there is really no food, and the damn demon beast can't touch one, give up."
<br><br>Lone Wunian said with a desperate face as he dragged his heavy steps.
<br><br>Behind him, Yun Yaoyao also did not speak, apparently the mood was also negative to the extreme.
<br><br>"No, we'll be at our destination soon."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the two and said.
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>Both of them looked up at Yi Feng at the same time.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded firmly and led the two people to continue walking.
<br><br>Another half day later, but still did not reach the destination Yi Feng said.
<br><br>And Lone Wunian and Yun Yoyao could not walk anymore, they were already completely at their limit.
<br><br>"I really can't walk anymore."
<br><br>The bloodless Lone Wunian half-kneeled on the ground and said in a weak voice.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was also full of reluctance.
<br><br>"Another half day of walking will bring us to our destination."
<br><br>Yi Feng took a sip of water and said firmly towards the two.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, I don't believe you anymore, I really can't walk anymore." Lone Wunian shook his head and said, "I don't blame you either, if you can walk, then walk by yourself."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao pursed her red lips, also raised her head and said, "Or you can walk by yourself."
<br><br>"This time, I really didn't lie to you, I already remembered the way here, I can definitely get there in another half day." Yi Feng said with a firm expression.
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>The two people looked at Yi Feng suspiciously.
<br><br>"Really!"
<br><br>"Come with me."
<br><br>"If you really can't walk to the destination after half a day, it's not too late for you guys to give up." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>The two people looked at each other.
<br><br>Gritted their teeth.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>Then last another half a day.
<br><br>If it's not what Yi Feng said, the big deal is just one more half day of hard work before you die.
<br><br>Just like that.
<br><br>Under Yi Feng's insistence, the two people are persisting for half a day and half a day.
<br><br>After two days, the two people who were hungry and starving finally sat on the ground on their asses.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, I don't believe you anymore, today I am not going to take half a step." Lone Wunian said with a face full of resentment.
<br><br>"What about you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked towards Yun Yoyo.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao shook her head with an ugly face, obviously also wanting to give up.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>"Look guys, what's here?" Yi Feng said.
<br><br>At his words.
<br><br>The two people hurriedly looked.
<br><br>Immediately, they found that a huge hall was presented in front of the two.
<br><br>The appearance of this large hall made hope rise in the eyes of the originally desperate ones.
<br><br>Because of the passage stone walls for so many days, suddenly seeing such a large hall, the shock for them could not be mentioned how great it was.
<br><br>"Let's go, come with me to take a look inside."
<br><br>"This big hall is linked to many passages, I think the opportunity to walk out is inside."
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The two people nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Even their tired and hungry state was forgotten as they followed Yi Feng towards the great hall.
<br><br>"A bubble of urine from that old monster earlier almost made my soul fly apart, so many days of stabilization, finally the state of the divine soul has been stabilized!"
<br><br>In the darkness.
<br><br>It just so happened that a virtual shadow opened its eyes.
<br><br>"But it's still much weaker than before, ah, I'm afraid it won't last many years anymore."
<br><br>"So in this case, I'm afraid I'll have to lower lower the requirements for taking the body."
<br><br>"The test of the formation, revoke it!"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>He revoked the formation inside the main hall.
<br><br>"Next, as long as someone is able to walk into this great hall, I will seize the shedding!"
<br><br>There was a renewed glint of hope in the eyes of the shadow.
<br><br>After all, those who could walk here through their own perseverance despite the suppression of their cultivation could also prove that the person's qualifications were not bad.
<br><br>Even if it's not by perseverance, but by luck to get here, that still means the person has good luck.
<br><br>So no matter what, he won't seize the body to the crooked melon and inferior claw.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"There's movement?"
<br><br>"Is this someone coming?"
<br><br>"Ahaha?"
<br><br>"It seems that the old man is really in luck, this is not just lowering the requirements, and someone has come to the door."
<br><br>"Then old man, I'll be polite."
<br><br>With a roar in his heart, he transformed into an invisible shadow in the great hall and rushed directly in the direction of the person who came.
<br><br>The first to strike is the strongest.
<br><br>Without giving the incoming person any chance to react, he directly seized the body with the speed of lightning.
