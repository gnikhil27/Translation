"Yes!"
<br><br>He opened his mouth to agree.
<br><br>The crowd smiled, and their expressions were instantly happy.
<br><br>"However, it is impossible to let you guys open a store right away."
<br><br>Yi Feng added: "After all, there is no population on the island in the early stage, you guys can't do business, so in the early stage, you guys will take up jobs in my clan, and the matter of opening a store will be discussed later when there are more people."
<br><br>The reason for this arrangement, Yi Feng is also thought of, whether the sect is established or later built, many things need help.
<br><br>And this group of old men and women and leisure, and also know the roots, the key is good to feed, do not have to pay much salary.
<br><br>No need for nothing.
<br><br>"For example, old Mrs. Zhang, you can cook, you can be my clan's caterer!"
<br><br>"And you, you watch the door."
<br><br>"The other few, the island in and out have to row, you guys give me rowing to go." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"No problem." The people have said, "We, a group of old men, have a mouth to feed, it is satisfied."
<br><br>After talking about everything.
<br><br>A group of people, in great numbers, marched towards the island.
<br><br>"I'm back."
<br><br>"This island, is my Yi Feng's, in the future everything here, I say what I want, haha ......"
<br><br>After getting on the island, Yi Feng couldn't help but shout.
<br><br>However, his voice just fell.
<br><br>Above the entire island, the clouds suddenly began to change, a unique law of heaven and earth, booming with the island as the core, including the entire surrounding lake, enveloped down.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Whether it was the old men and women present, or the workers who were building, a strange look passed over their faces.
<br><br>"It seems that the realm of Mr., or beyond our original guess!"
<br><br>"A word forms a small world by itself, tsk, this means ......"
<br><br>"Yeah, within this range, the rules have completely changed, and I can't seem to fly."
<br><br>"Yeah, my cultivation is also completely suppressed."
<br><br>"What's even more peculiar is that I can no longer feel the call of the immortal world, it seems that I don't need to go to the immortal world within a year."
<br><br>"Yes, it seems we don't have to think about how to solve the problem of going to the immortal world, we can stay by Mr. all the time."
<br><br>"It seems that here, it is completely beyond the control of the Immortal Realm and the laws of the Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"Hum you old men, didn't you think about going to the Immortal Realm before?"
<br><br>"Put your mother's fart, when did I want to go to the immortal world, what immortal world can have followed in front of Mr. fragrant?"
<br><br>"What are you people muttering about?" Walking in front of Yi Feng could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Nothing sir."
<br><br>The crowd was silenced and followed Yi Feng.
<br><br>"I'll take you guys around the island first." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads and followed.
<br><br>After going around the island, Yi Feng planned on a piece of straw paper.
<br><br>"Look, this is some of my preliminary planning."
<br><br>"The mountain forest to the north of the island will be treated as a back mountain of our sect, and some small animals should be kept inside, although the danger is not great, but you old men and women should not go there." Yi Feng reminded.
<br><br>The people smiled and nodded their heads.
<br><br>And did not dare to refute Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>After all, these small animals, in their opinion, were indeed a bit dangerous.
<br><br>"And our clan will be established near the back of the mountain."
<br><br>Said Yi Feng, planning out an area on the grass paper.
<br><br>"In addition is the mountain gate, martial arts field, residential area, book collection pavilion ......" Yi Feng divided the other territories one by one.
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads.
<br><br>"Next, I will need to assign you guys some tasks." After thinking about it, Yi Feng said towards these old men and women again.
<br><br>"Sir command."
<br><br>"En, I need a super big tree, but I don't know where it is, you people are old and experienced, so I am going to send two people to help me find it." Yi Feng instructed.
<br><br>The reason why he wanted this kind of tree was still for the sake of his clan.
<br><br>After all, fooling a hundred disciples was his primary goal, so something that looked high and mighty had to be gotten.
<br><br>So in the center of the sect, carving a dragon, is necessary.
<br><br>And for such a big carving, a big enough tree is definitely needed.
<br><br>"Sir, which kind of tree do you want?"
<br><br>The two old men couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"En, the quality must be good, after all, I am going to carve it." Yi Feng said, "As for the material, you have also seen my carvings, so you should also know the standard I need, right?"
<br><br>"Your standard ......"
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>A few old men looked at each other and said with a face full of pressure: "We know where there is one that can meet your standards, but I'm afraid it's difficult to get it ......"
<br><br>"Just a tree, I believe you guys."
<br><br>Yi Feng said: "And really difficult words, whether it is money or what, in any case, at all costs to get over it is, I have to carry you, you are afraid of what?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Originally there was pressure of several old men suddenly have confidence.
<br><br>"Understood, with Mr. behind us, we will get it at all costs."
<br><br>"Very good."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded in satisfaction, then turned his gaze back to Ye Bei and the others.
<br><br>"Sir, please give the order."
<br><br>Ye Bei and the others were busy approaching and respectfully waiting for Yi Feng.
<br><br>"To be honest, these people you are looking for are not very good." Slightly hesitant, Yi Feng still said what was in his heart.
<br><br>It wasn't that he was nitpicking.
<br><br>The main thing is that most of this group of people are old men, each one looks breathless, he is really a little worried about the progress.
<br><br>"It's not quite ready?"
<br><br>Ye Bei and the others were full of difficulties.
<br><br>This one is at least a Martial Exalted, many sect heads and elders have been pulled over, not too good yet.
<br><br>The standard for this person to move bricks is a little too high, right?
<br><br>"Of course, I still trust you guys, come are here, they will stay for now, but the manpower is still not enough, so next you have to find a group, but the quality should be a little stronger." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Stronger quality, for example?" Ye Bei asked cautiously.
<br><br>"Such as ......"
<br><br>"Similar to this little brother."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng will look at a certain inn a runner little brother, this little brother is Pingjiang City with the few young people on the island.
<br><br>This little brother looks strong and sturdy, a glance can work, so recruiting workers to his kind of physique as the standard, is certainly just right.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Ye Bei and others drew a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>This standard ......
<br><br>"What, is it difficult?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Ye Bei and the others and said.
<br><br>"No, it's not embarrassment."
<br><br>Ye Bei and the others ironically, stifled their heads and answered.
<br><br>Because this one explained the matter, they had to respond even if it was difficult, to do their best.
<br><br>"Finally, there is one more thing to explain to you." Yi Feng explained again towards Ye Bei and others.
<br><br>"Sir command."
<br><br>Ye Bei and others said respectfully.
<br><br>"Since our island is not very convenient, many materials are not very good to carry, and the materials over here are really not very good, so I plan to teach you guys to burn bricks and be self-sufficient to complete the construction." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"Burning bricks by yourself?"
<br><br>The crowd looked blankly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Yes, burn them yourself, I will teach you guys how to do it later." Yi Feng said, "But before firing, you also need to give you a finished product standard."
<br><br>"Because working for me, tofu-dreg projects are not okay, so the bricks that are fired must all have this quality."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng took out a brick from his pocket and slapped it on the ground.
