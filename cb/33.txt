 Yi Feng wanted to refuse, but Yin Xiong was too generous to refuse, so he had to accept it frankly, I'm afraid this Bao Feng Chamber of Commerce may really intend to develop in this direction!
<br><br>After he left the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, Yi Feng returned to the martial arts school, and his whole body was much more relaxed.
<br><br>With the full operation of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, I think he can really make some money and no longer have to worry about this.
<br><br>At the same time, Luo Lanxue and Yin Luoli also returned to the Qingshan Sect and reported this matter to the Old Ancestor of Qingshan in time.
<br><br>"Not bad, it was done well."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan was full of joy and said, "Now it seems that our relationship with senior is getting better and better, it's just a pity that senior lent me the divine sword, but I didn't chop Xuan Wu under the sword."
<br><br>"Yes!" Luo Lanxue also slightly sighed, but still puzzled asked: "Master, that day you hold the divine sword chase Xuanwu old man Wan Yu Li, look at the situation, how he will also be cut by you under the sword ah, how can ......"
<br><br>"Alas, the previous intelligence on Xuanwu is still wrong ah!"
<br><br>Qing Shan old ancestor sighed: "real hand to hand to understand, he stepped into the Martial King more than thirty years, plus I am not strong enough, can not fully control the divine sword, which let him escape a disaster ah!"
<br><br>"No wonder ......"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue then nodded, face is also heart palpitations, if not for Mr. Yi's divine sword, I'm afraid that day in the wind and rain platform, she lost the master it! One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"By the way Xue'er, that human crystal fruit you personally handed to the senior!" Seemingly remembering something else, the Qingshan old ancestor said again in a hurry.
<br><br>"A total of eight have all been handed over to senior." Luo Lanxue said respectfully.
<br><br>"That's good then." Old Ancestor Qing Shan nodded his head, then with a wave of his palm, he took out a jade box and said again, "Xue'er, here is another human crystal fruit, take it and share it with Luo Li!"
<br><br>"Ah, Master, how can this be, there are only nine Human Crystal Fruits in a thousand years, it's better for you to enjoy such a valuable thing yourself!" Luo Lanxue hastily excused herself.
<br><br>"It's okay, I followed your master for a thousand years and had the honor of tasting a petal, originally all nine were to be given to senior Yi, but I thought of you two, so I took out one for you on purpose." Green Mountain Ancestor said with a smile.
<br><br>"Master." Luo Lanxue had tears in her eyes.
<br><br>"Go down, I still have to go into seclusion, when I come out of seclusion, follow me to visit senior once more." After saying that, Old Ancestor Qingshan had closed his eyes.
<br><br>"Yes, my disciple bids farewell."
<br><br>Only then did Luo Lanxue hold the jade box with both hands and respectfully retreated.
<br><br>Time, quietly passed.
<br><br>It was already into late autumn.
<br><br>And Yi Feng's book had been successfully issued under the entire operation of the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>Martial Hall.
<br><br>Yi Feng sat by the bed, his palm resting on top of Zhong Qing's forehead.
<br><br>"Master, I'm fine." Zhong Qing opened his eyes and said, "You go rest, I'll go cook when I'm comfortable after lying down for a while."
<br><br>"Still saying it's okay?" Yi Feng's face sank and he scolded: "Look what kind of fever you have, and look at the swelling of your hands and feet, lie down properly and don't move anywhere."
<br><br>Yi Feng rarely gets angry, which makes Zhong Qing silent and shut his mouth.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng sighed softly.
<br><br>He was only to blame for not putting too much thought into Zhong Qing, the child practiced boxing all day, causing muscle strain and swollen hands and feet, and with the cold, he was already emaciated.
<br><br>After covering Zhong Qing with a blanket, Yi Feng walked to the front room with his head in his hands and then picked up a bamboo basket, intending to go to the back mountains of Pingjiang City to pick some medicine for Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Zhong Qing, the child, although not long known, and even gave Yi Feng part of the economic burden, but since he came, all the small and large chores do not want Yi Feng to do personally.
<br><br>In the heart, this child has long been a part of his family.
<br><br>Before leaving, Yi Feng explained the opposite of the boy to look after Zhong Qing, after all, this go also do not know to a few days, and then took a sickle into the mountain.
<br><br>The so-called hope mountain run dead horse is exactly this, a full three days of time, Yi Feng walked to the foot of the mountain.
<br><br>The good thing is, there is no big beast inside this mountain, usually you can rely on wild fruits and rabbits, mountain spring water to quench your thirst, while dishes of medicine, although also tired, but some of the strange beauty of the mountain is also a rare visual feast.
<br><br>And Yi Feng in the mountains of these days, Pingjiang City has set off a book chasing craze.
<br><br>A "Supreme Treasure and Purple Haze Fairy" came out of nowhere.
<br><br>The love-hate relationship between the two protagonists in the book, the yin and yang, resonated with countless people, so the first edition released, was swept away.
<br><br>This is not only for mortals, even most of the female disciples of the Castle Peak Sect, basically holding a copy of the book in their hands.
<br><br>"Sir's book is really good-looking, this kind of book, I'm afraid that only a person like sir can write it!"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue is sitting on the top of the mountain of the Castle Peak Sect, the clouds are dazzling and passing by, the pretty body is hidden from a distance, beautiful like a heavenly immortal.
<br><br>But two days, Luo Lanxue finished reading the book once, when the book closed, I do not know whether out of regret or reluctance to the story in the book, beautiful eyes filled with fog.
<br><br>"Xue'er."
<br><br>At this time, a figure landed beside Luo Lanxue, who carried himself with authority and looked at Luo Lanxue with his hands in the air.
<br><br>"Greetings, senior brother of the sect master."
<br><br>The person who came was none other than Zhu Yun of the Green Mountain Sect, and Luo Lanxue got up to pay her respects.
<br><br>"Xue'er, why has the sect been so lax lately, no disciples can be seen practicing in the martial arts arena?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun just came out of seclusion, he found the unprecedented quietness of the Castle Peak Sect, completely without the kind of euphoric scene of the past days, as the sect master is naturally unwilling to see this scene, speaking with a trace of anger on his face.
<br><br>Hearing this, Luo Lanxue gave a bitter smile before saying, "Enlightenment master brother, I'm afraid this has to do with Mr. Yi's book."
<br><br>"Mr. Yi's book?"
<br><br>Zhu Yun was instantly shocked and reached out, "Do you have it?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue extended her jade hand.
<br><br>Zhu Yun took the book, solemnly held it in his hand and asked, "Is this really written by Mr. Yi?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue nodded her head solemnly.
<br><br>Zhu Yun inhaled a breath of excitement, and with a swipe of his paws in the air, he had reached the sky.
<br><br>"Senior brother you?"
<br><br>Luo Lanxue shouted.
<br><br>"I closed for two days, you help handle things in the sect, something to discuss later." Zhu Yun's voice transmission came from the sky.
<br><br>Luo Lanxue was stunned.
<br><br>"Sect master senior brother you, didn't you just come out of seclusion?"
<br><br>But the sky ......
<br><br>There was no longer a single echo.
