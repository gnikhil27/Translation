Since that woman is in this mountain, then it means that they, sooner or later, will encounter this woman.
<br><br>The death of the gold line first, if the woman knows that the wood line, fire line, earth line has also died, then the two sides will meet, it is bound to be a dead end.
<br><br>The thought of this.
<br><br>He felt a headache.
<br><br>Because he faced this woman, he was not sure at all.
<br><br>Under a tree.
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei sat on the muddy ground with boredom.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Bored!"
<br><br>He sighed and fished out a bead from his arms, throwing it on the ground and playing with it.
<br><br>"Brother, don't sigh, my brother will give you a show." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In the sleeve, drilled out a centipede said flatteringly, and then erected his body rolling that bead to turn in a circle.
<br><br>"Night wind, ah, you roll the beads of the look, like a shit ball of shit, there is nothing to see, you better save it!" Bone Ben Wei shook his head and said.
<br><br>"Brother, my brother is not seeing you bored to make you happy." The night wind centipede said flatteringly: "You really are not happy, you play me, right?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei white night wind centipede a glance, no good said: "I play you what is the point, I want is the sister, sister you know?"
<br><br>"Alas, speaking of which, I have no idea how long I have not touched the sister."
<br><br>Just in a bone a centipede have a chat, the fog swept out of a figure, it is a long time no return Yun Lang.
<br><br>"Phew, finally found someone, this fog is unusual!"
<br><br>Yun Lang breathed a sigh of relief, he had done his business long ago, except that this fog had shielded his vision and senses, making it impossible for him to find the location of Desolate Pathless and the others.
<br><br>However, when he found out that the person he found was Bone Ben Wei, his face suddenly turned gloomy.
<br><br>"Hey Shorty, let me ask you, where is my master?" Yun Lang asked with a cold face.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei gave him a blank look and ignored it.
<br><br>Yun Lang was instantly filled with anger.
<br><br>Good for you, shorty, the previous incident on the river is just fine, but now actually ignore him again, really made him angry.
<br><br>But just when he wanted to take advantage of no one to teach a lesson to Bones Ben Wei, suddenly found in front of the fog, a tall figure slowly walked out.
<br><br>She was dressed in revealing clothes and had beautiful features.
<br><br>The most striking thing is her head of silver hair, draped over the shoulders like a cascading waterfall.
<br><br>But this is such a woman, immediately let Yun Lang face suddenly changed, as if he had seen a ghost.
<br><br>He never thought that he would run into this woman here.
<br><br>"Yun Lang has met senior Shui Xing, I didn't know senior was here, Yun Lang has offended many times, I will leave now immediately."
<br><br>Yun Lang said with a stifled fist towards the visitor.
<br><br>He then turned his gaze to Bone Ben Wei and even made a wink and shouted, "Shorty, go, come with me."
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei as if he did not hear his words, dumbfounded at the approaching woman, his mouth could not help but murmur: "What a beautiful young lady, if only I could accompany me for one night."
<br><br>To die!
<br><br>Hearing these words from Bones Ben Wei, Yun Lang almost had his soul scared out of him.
<br><br>At this moment, he wanted to strangle Bone Ben Wei to death.
<br><br>The little dwarf who didn't know the sky was high, didn't even look at who appeared in front of him, how dare he say such a big talk.
<br><br>Sweating coldly, he hurriedly smiled at the woman and said, "Senior, I will take him away immediately."
<br><br>With that, he took the palm of Skeleton Ben Wei and was about to take him away.
<br><br>But before he could lift his steps, from the woman's mouth, a playful voice came out.
<br><br>"You, are the one from that Desolate Pathless, right?"
<br><br>Yun Lang was stunned in place like a lightning strike, and a bitter smile appeared on his face.
<br><br>He originally thought that this woman did not recognize him, so he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to speedily take Bone Ben Wei out of here.
<br><br>But it did not occur to him that this woman had revealed his identity with a single word.
<br><br>With the relationship between His Holiness and this woman, I'm afraid it's impossible for him to leave.
<br><br>"Senior really has good eyesight."
<br><br>Yun Lang simply gave up on running away and turned around and smiled.
<br><br>But the woman did not pay attention to Yun Lang, but her eyes looked straight at the bead in Bone Ben Wei's hand.
<br><br>The reason she appeared here was also because of the aura on this bead that attracted her over.
<br><br>The demon pellet of the Second Life Demon Emperor.
<br><br>And it was also a water attribute demon pellet.
<br><br>For her, it was a rare treasure!
<br><br>"Senior, it doesn't matter if I stay, but this dwarf next to me he's just a mortal who happens to be on the same road, can you let him go?" Yun Lang said towards the woman.
<br><br>At the same time also lowered his head towards the skeleton Ben Wei said softly: "Shorty, originally did not look at you, but this matter is indeed not related to you, I will try my best to find a way to let you escape, if you can run out, try to find my master, will tell him the things here, if you can not find my master ...... you hurry Leave this place, and never, never come back."
<br><br>But the woman still ignored Yun Lang.
<br><br>Those soulful eyes were still staring intently at the demon pellet in Bone Ben Wei's hand.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>She slowly lifted those long, flawless legs and walked towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Lang's face changed and stopped in front of Bone Ben Wei with a stifled scalp and said, "Senior, I said that he is just a mortal, he has nothing to do with what happened between us, I still hope that you will let him go."
<br><br>"Noisy."
<br><br>The woman finally showed her impatience, and as her voice fell, a water drop appeared out of thin air, then coalesced into a transparent palm.
<br><br>It fiercely smacked at Yun Lang's face.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>Yun Lang fell straight to the ground with his eyes staring, foaming at the mouth.
<br><br>"A waste, what kind of existence are you looking for, he wants you a waste to find a way to escape?"
<br><br>The woman gave Yun Lang a disdainful glance before she looked at Bone Ben Wei and asked with a tight frown, "Your Excellency, who is it?"
