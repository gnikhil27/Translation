After planning all this.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly.
<br><br>Heart is finally a little bit of bottom.
<br><br>And began to act, the first step he first bought a piece of land.
<br><br>This piece of land is two miles long and wide, deep not only a small hill, behind the small hill there is a not too small forest.
<br><br>Although the purchase went well, but the land alone cost Yi Feng most of his family fortune.
<br><br>Let his heart and liver straight pain.
<br><br>And since you want to get the sect, the martial arts school also does not have the need to exist, so Yi Feng took off the martial arts school sign, here in the future as his own bedchamber it!
<br><br>And the next step.
<br><br>It is to invest a lot of manpower to build up this two-mile radius.
<br><br>At this time. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Outside the door came three figures.
<br><br>It was Ye Bei, Shake Tian Que, Guan Yun Peng three.
<br><br>At this moment, the three trembled and stood at the entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>"See, originally this signboard contains a powerful martial intent, just do not know why that one took it off." Guan Yunpeng said as he stared overhead.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que nodded his head with deep feeling.
<br><br>But the more so the more panic in his heart, a signboard contains a powerful martial intent, this master's power simply beyond their imagination.
<br><br>"Right remember, this senior has always called himself a mortal, should be here to feel life, so later we must not reveal cultivation and break his precepts." Guan Yunpeng remembered something and explained again.
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>Shake Tian Que and Ye Bei nodded their heads like chickens pecking rice.
<br><br>"Shaking Heavenly Que, Ye Bei, Guan Yunpeng, begging to see sir, especially for senior."
<br><br>The three bowed at the entrance of the martial school and their voices came out in unison.
<br><br>"Pleading guilty?"
<br><br>Hearing the voice, Yi Feng walked out from inside the martial arts school and looked at the three, he was still a bit puzzled, but seeing the three, he instantly understood.
<br><br>These two old men, is not exactly the two who fought last time and broke his roof tiles?
<br><br>And this young man, he also has an impression.
<br><br>He had come to kick the pavilion before, only to be beaten down by him.
<br><br>Things have been so long ago, Yi Feng long ago did not put these three people on the heart, but did not expect them to really come to make amends.
<br><br>This is really out of Yi Feng's expectation.
<br><br>I have to say, the quality of this otherworldly people is really good ah.
<br><br>"Sir sorry, last time I broke the tiles of your roof, but we can only get so many things together with all our money." Guan Yunpeng and Shake Heavenly Que said.
<br><br>On the other side, Ye Bei also sent out his voice and said, "Sir, last time I ignorantly kicked the museum and caused inconvenience to you, so I came to make amends with you, only that I can only gather so much with all my family fortune, so I hope you must not be blamed."
<br><br>After saying that, three people bowed at the same time and took out all the things in their hands, big and small, and presented them with both hands respectfully.
<br><br>Looking at the things these people took out, Yi Feng was a bit speechless.
<br><br>Because there are all kinds of miscellaneous.
<br><br>For example, an iron knife ......
<br><br>A basin ......
<br><br>A stone ......
<br><br>These three people dressed okay, actually poor into this look?
<br><br>But because of their sincere attitude, as well as this good quality, Yi Feng did not make things difficult for them.
<br><br>After all, this kind of spirit to know the wrong to change, really too rare.
<br><br>If it were ordinary people, broke your things, I'm afraid long run away, who will bring things to the door to ask forgiveness?
<br><br>So, what they really compensate is not important to Yi Feng, what is important is this attitude.
<br><br>"All right, things have passed, it's no big deal."
<br><br>So then, Yi Feng waved his hand and said without caring.
<br><br>Smell the words.
<br><br>The three people's bodies trembled violently.
<br><br>Almost cried out directly.
<br><br>Although they held on to the hope that Yi Feng would not pursue them, but never thought it would be so smooth.
<br><br>The devil knows how depressing it was for them during this time.
<br><br>This moment, is simply the dark clouds scattered ah!
<br><br>This high person is also really high person, broadmindedness is not ordinary.
<br><br>"Thank you sir, thank you sir."
<br><br>The three bowed gratefully towards Yi Feng, while handing the things in their hands towards Yi Feng again.
<br><br>Looking at these things they handed over, Yi Feng hesitated.
<br><br>Hesitating whether he should take them or not.
<br><br>Because these things were of little use to him, Yi Feng, but from what they said, it was something they had poured their families into to come up with.
<br><br>"Well, it's convenient to ask what you guys are doing?" Yi Feng couldn't help but hall said.
<br><br>"What do we do?"
<br><br>The three people were stunned at the words.
<br><br>Can't say they are cultivating, right?
<br><br>That would definitely not work.
<br><br>After all, they did not forget that this one himself called himself a mortal and was sensing ordinary life, so if they said so, wouldn't that be breaking the commandment?
<br><br>Then what exactly do they do?
<br><br>They did not think when they came Yi Feng would ask them this ah!
<br><br>For a while, the three stammered.
<br><br>"Are you not bricklayers?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the small and lightweight iron knife, could not help but ask.
<br><br>Because this kind of knife Yi Feng but remember, in a previous life is called brick knife, when building walls to sharpen the brick.
<br><br>At that, the three eyes lit up.
<br><br>Immediately words should say: "Yes, yes, sir is really powerful, a glance to see what we are for, we are indeed bricklayers."
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, this occupation in this world is definitely the most grassroots existence, no wonder so poor.
<br><br>And the guy who eats brick knives are used to make amends, also let Yi Feng more appreciation for the quality of these people.
<br><br>This kind of people.
<br><br>Worth the contact.
<br><br>"You have on hand, how many people?" Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"Uh ...... Mr. wants people?"
<br><br>Ye Bei's eyes lit up and he was the first to react and asked.
<br><br>"Yes, want people, so how many can you guys call in?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>Ye Bei speculated on Yi Feng's mind, then said, "If senior needs it, as many as you want."
<br><br>"It's done."
<br><br>Yi Feng snapped his fingers, turned around and said, "You three come in and sit down, there happens to be something to discuss with you."
