Thinking of this, he casually took out a king grade elixir from his storage ring.
<br><br>"Hey, shorty, do you know what this is?"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard raised the elixir in his hand and shouted.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>What he didn't expect was that this elixir of his didn't attract this shorty's attention at all.
<br><br>It merely gave him a blank look.
<br><br>Even that look seemed to be full of contempt.
<br><br>God.
<br><br>The black-clothed guard was burning with rage.
<br><br>Almost blew up straight away.
<br><br>He was actually despised by this damn mortal dwarf. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>However, he still held back his anger, after all, in his opinion, this dwarf might not be able to read what was in his hand at all.
<br><br>So he held back his anger and said directly, "To tell you the truth, this is an elixir, and it is also a king grade elixir, just this one elixir is priceless to you mortals."
<br><br>After saying that, he looked his gaze towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>He seemed to have seen this dwarf's astonished and salivating appearance after knowing that it was a king grade elixir in his hand.
<br><br>Because this king grade elixir was nothing to him, but it was definitely able to make mortals feel eye-candy.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei's reaction was once again out of his expectation.
<br><br>Didn't even look at him.
<br><br>Yes, after he said that it was a king grade elixir, this damn mortal didn't even look at him.
<br><br>This almost directly made the black-clothed guard go berserk.
<br><br>This was a king grade elixir!
<br><br>Why should you, a mortal, not show the slightest surprise and even ignore it?
<br><br>"Fine, you pretend, I'll let you pretend!"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard's teeth gnashed as his palm moved and took out another elixir.
<br><br>"This is an imperial elixir, even Martial Emperors can't get one even if they fight for their heads, now I just need you to jump off the boat yourself and I can give you this elixir, how about that, this is a heavenly chance for you."
<br><br>Speaking of this, the black-clothed guard raised the corners of his mouth again.
<br><br>He just didn't believe it.
<br><br>Under such a YOU, this mortal dwarf in front of him could still hold back.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei would look at him.
<br><br>But to his surprise, instead of salivating, a voice of contempt came out: "You take a broken dog food there to force chatter for half a day, and also told me to jump ship, are you brain bumped?"
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>This sentence almost choked out a mouthful of old blood from the black-clothed guard.
<br><br>"Dog food?"
<br><br>"How dare you call my royalty elixir dog food?"
<br><br>"Scare the dog's eyes out of you!"
<br><br>He shouted furiously.
<br><br>However, Skeleton Ben Wei gave him another nonchalant look and said indifferently, "What am I lying to you for, that doggie of mine is usually high on this stuff!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei this completely does not put him in the eyes, but also so humiliated his appearance, completely will black guard to anger, trembling his eyes flashing thick anger.
<br><br>"You lowly mortal, I'll teach you a good lesson today even at the risk of angering His Holiness." With that, he moved his palm into a sharp claw mark and grabbed towards Skeleton Ben Wei's neck.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that he was about to grab Bone Ben Wei, but the latter slightly tilted his head.
<br><br>The black-clothed guard's face changed greatly.
<br><br>Obviously his force control is very good, but under the inexplicable, he fluttered, the whole person planted in the river.
<br><br>Yi Feng and Desolate Wuji, who were chatting with each other, heard the commotion behind them and hurriedly turned around to look.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in surprise.
<br><br>But Desolate Wujing frowned.
<br><br>He knew exactly what strength this guard of his was, but how could he suddenly fall into the river?
<br><br>After getting on the shore, Desolate Wuji looked directly at the black-clothed guard with questioning eyes.
<br><br>"Your Majesty I, I I I ......"
<br><br>The black-clothed guard was red in the face, stammering half a day unable to speak.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Forced by Desolate Wujing's might, the black-clothed guard then told the original story, and then he hurriedly explained, "I just wanted to teach him a lesson, but I don't know how, but I fell into the river."
<br><br>"Humph, nonsense."
<br><br>Desolate Pathless scolded.
<br><br>"Your majesty, my subordinate deserves to die, my subordinate will never dare to do it again." Under Desolate Wujing's might, the black-clothed guard sweated coldly, lowering his head and not daring to breathe a single breath.
<br><br>"Better so."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing glared at him, his eyes filled with anger.
<br><br>Only what made him go back and forth was that, putting this matter aside, with the strength of this guard of his, how could he have fallen inside the river because of this?
<br><br>Can't help but, he will sharp gaze, looked at Yi Feng's escort, that wearing black robe dwarf.
<br><br>Up and down, solemnly sizing up ......
