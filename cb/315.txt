"Uh!"
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng helplessly rubbed his nose.
<br><br>It was true.
<br><br>How could a demonic beast be so weak and be cut to death by his chopping sword in a few seconds?
<br><br>After returning to the cave, Yun Yaoyao was waiting for him.
<br><br>Then opened his mouth and said, "Let me tell you a good news."
<br><br>"Oh, are you ready to give me money?" Yi Feng hurriedly sat over and asked.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was filled with speechlessness.
<br><br>Mortals are mortals, their eyes are ultimately short-sighted, their eyes actually only see money. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>And money is actually the lowest thing in their cultivator's eyes.
<br><br>But anyone with higher eyesight, looking for her to order pills or other things, are not a million or eight hundred thousand gold coins can be compared.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>She also did not mean to look down on.
<br><br>It's just that different people have different eyesight.
<br><br>"Originally, my cultivation could not be restored in a short period of time, but an inexplicable energy appeared inside my body and was impacting the Bull Demon's seal." Yun Yoyo said, "So tomorrow, I should be able to break the seal and recover my cultivation."
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up and he quickly said, "Good news indeed, get out sooner you will be able to pay me sooner."
<br><br>"Can you stop opening and closing your mouth about money?"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo's face was cold and said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Do not talk about money I talk to you about love?"
<br><br>Yi Feng did not have the good grace to white Yun Yoyao glance, said indignantly.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao's expression was stagnant.
<br><br>She found that staying with this mortal for a long time is simply to be able to die of anger, but she was not able to do anything to him.
<br><br>"I'm just curious about this energy in my body, how did it come about." Yun Yoyao said changing the subject.
<br><br>"Could it be the wild fruits I picked for you?" Yi Feng guessed.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao shook her head.
<br><br>These wild fruits she has not seen, are just ordinary wild fruits, and how can there be such a powerful force.
<br><br>"Then could it be the herbs I put on you, I am very good at dispensing medicine." Yi Feng said again.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao glanced at Yi Feng.
<br><br>She knew that discussing this with Yi Feng was simply a waste of breath.
<br><br>With just two herbs, although it cured her snake bite wound, but to say that it could also help her break through the seal, this is simply a heavenly nightmare.
<br><br>"Tomorrow, my cultivation will be restored, and then I will take you out of the mountain."
<br><br>It seemed that she did not want to talk more with Yi Feng, so she closed her beautiful eyes again and entered a state of deep meditation.
<br><br>A day quickly passed.
<br><br>When Yi Feng was still picking wild fruits inside the mountain, a huge aura suddenly erupted in the direction of the cave.
<br><br>Then a stream of light flashed out from the cave and arrived above Yi Feng's head a few moments later.
<br><br>Her feet stepped on the void, high up again.
<br><br>A huge aura was emanating from her body.
<br><br>"You've recovered your cultivation?" Yi Feng asked excitedly.
<br><br>She nodded expressionlessly, and with a slight stretch of her jade hand, the long sword in Yi Feng's hand automatically floated towards her and fell into her hand.
<br><br>"There are quite a few demonic beasts around here, it's not too safe here, I'll put you in a safe place first, after I settle some things, I'll take you out of the mountain."
<br><br>"Okay, no problem."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly said, "By the way, are you going to take me along for the flight?"
<br><br>"Or what?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao gave Yi Feng a look.
<br><br>"Okay, come on, I'm ready." Yi Feng spread his hands and asked, "Are you going to fly with me on your back or princess hug, I can do it."
<br><br>"Thinking is quite beautiful."
<br><br>The corner of Yun Yaoyao's mouth couldn't help but twitch, after a cold snort, one hand pulled Yi Feng's palm, and he had swept to the high altitude.
<br><br>"You're not afraid?"
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng who was flying in mid-air, Yun Yoyo couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>"You, aren't you surprised, or take a look at the scenery below?" Yun Yoyo looked at the bland Yi Feng and couldn't help but ask again.
<br><br>"What is there to see here?"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but white Yun Yoyao a glance, the former life of his plane sat more right.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao was speechless.
<br><br>Shortly after, she was on a mountain peak and put Yi Feng down.
<br><br>"You wait for me here, do not run around, when I finish the matter, I will send you out of the mountain." Yun Yaoyao instructed.
<br><br>"What are you going to do?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"I have some grudges with that bull demon who injured me, so before I leave, I have to settle all the old and new debts."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yun Yaoyao's pupils shrank slightly, and a killing intent filled out.
<br><br>"You can't beat him, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked suspiciously.
<br><br>"Last time it was just my carelessness, since I already know his methods, it's much easier to deal with him."
<br><br>"You stay well, I'm leaving."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao swept up with her sword, flying above the hundred thousand mountains, her sharp gaze searched for traces of the Bull Demon.
<br><br>"What's going on, with his aura, it should be easy to catch, how come he can't be found?"
<br><br>After searching a circle, Yun Yaoyao stood in the air and frowned with a good-looking brow.
<br><br>"Since this is the case, then this is how it has to be done."
<br><br>After a movement of her eyes, she leapt out and arrived at the place where she had fought with the Bull Demon before.
<br><br>The ground here was riddled with holes.
<br><br>Countless trees had been cut off at the waist.
<br><br>She landed and caught a trace of the Bull Demon's previously undissipated aura in this place.
<br><br>"Divine Trace!"
<br><br>A complicated hand seal was struck, and Yun Yaoyao closed her eyes.
<br><br>Seeking this trace of aura, he traced it out.
<br><br>At a certain place, Yun Yaoyao stopped because the aura of the Bull Demon was very heavy here, and it could be seen that the Bull Demon had stayed here for quite some time.
<br><br>However, after staying here for a while, the cow devil has left again.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao continued to track out.
<br><br>Finally came to the end of the breath.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"This place, why is it so familiar?"
<br><br>She tightened her good-looking eyebrows and observed the surroundings, and was immediately surprised to find that this place was near the cave where she and Yi Feng had stayed before.
<br><br>"I didn't expect that the Bull Demon was actually right outside our cave."
<br><br>"Only, the breath is broken here, but there is no trace of the Bull Demon, why is that?"
<br><br>She tightened her brow, always feeling that something was unusual.
<br><br>Just then, her gaze seemed to see something.
<br><br>The whole person.
<br><br>A fierce shock.
<br><br>After slowing down, with an unbelievable look, she hurriedly flew over towards that side.
<br><br>When she saw the scene in front of her, even with her state of mind, she could not help but draw a breath of cold air backwards.
