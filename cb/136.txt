Zhu Yun held his face, not daring to say another word.
<br><br>For a time, the atmosphere in the field fell into a bizarre, and the only sound left in the room was Ye Bei's begging for mercy.
<br><br>Perhaps Ye Bei himself is also a condescending person.
<br><br>But when the other party's level, beyond too much, even Ye Bei's arrogance also vanished.
<br><br>Because the arrogance of a mole is not worth mentioning at all.
<br><br>"To make amends, there must also be some sincerity, right?" At this time, the black-robed man finally came out with a voice.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!" Ye Bei was like grabbing a life-saving straw, trembling palms removed the storage ring, and then moved all the things inside it out.
<br><br>Such as martial skills, gong methods, king grade, royal grade treasures are quite a few ......
<br><br>However, the black-robed man said contemptuously, "This is all?"
<br><br>At that, Ye Bei was about to cry.
<br><br>This damn, damn but his whole body belongings ah! The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But in order to live, he still compensated with a smile and asked: "Senior, what else do you want?"
<br><br>"Those what imperial goods ah, clan goods junk don't use to mix, such as those rare treasures ah, like spirit treasure or something, you always have to get a thousand or eight hundred pieces to?" The black-robed man said coldly.
<br><br>"A thousand or eight hundred pieces of spiritual treasures?"
<br><br>Ye Bei's eyes suddenly stared.
<br><br>He was almost dumb.
<br><br>Spiritual treasures are not artificially created treasures, but are born first, and there is no clear classification, perhaps some of them do not bring direct increase in combat, but such innate spiritual treasures have unique efficacy, and are simply not created treasures can have, just like the flame beads, the treasure of the Castle Peak Sect.
<br><br>So this kind of treasure, let alone a thousand or eight hundred pieces, even one is not easy.
<br><br>"What's wrong, not willing?" The black-robed man asked in a cold voice.
<br><br>"Willingly, willingly." Ye Bei's face was bitter and he was busy explaining, "But I can only try my best to get as many as I can."
<br><br>"That's right, you're such a waste amount you can't get so much, since you don't have so many spirits, then use to compensate for other things!" The black-robed man said soberly.
<br><br>After saying that, he fell into a deep thought.
<br><br>In the end.
<br><br>What should he pay for?
<br><br>"Brother, brother! Sister, sister ah!"
<br><br>Just when the black-robed man was indecisive, an urgent voice came from Ao Qing at the side.
<br><br>On hearing this, the black-robed man gave Ao Qing an appreciative glance, his spirits lifted and he pointed at Ye Bei and shouted, "Yes, sister, also sister, it doesn't matter if you don't have so many spiritual treasures, how many spiritual treasures are missing, just give me as many sisters!"
<br><br>"Sister?"
<br><br>Hearing this, Ye Bei was immediately happy.
<br><br>Thousands of eight hundred pieces of spiritual treasures he is dead can not help, but get a thousand eight hundred sisters or very easy to do ah!
<br><br>"Yes, yes, senior, I will definitely find you enough girls!"
<br><br>Ye Bei hurriedly said.
<br><br>"Well, limit you to seven days or so to the martial arts school!" The black-robed man waved his hand and said, "Get lost!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes!"
<br><br>Ye Bei immediately revealed a look of relief, braced himself for the pain in his legs, swept up into the sky and ran.
<br><br>Then, the black-robed man turned his gaze to Old Man Qingshan and the others and shouted in a deep voice, "You guys get lost too, but next time you come to the martial arts school, don't come empty-handed again."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes senior."
<br><br>Under the pressure of the black-robed man, Old Ancestor Qingshan and the others were busy nodding their heads, and then respectfully excused themselves.
<br><br>Not far from the sky, a stream of light swiftly crossed by.
<br><br>"Damn Lu Qingshan, I, Lu Dasheng, the number one pill refiner in Southern Sand, was actually left out in the Qingshan Sect by you just like that, it is unbearable!"
<br><br>"If I didn't still need you to take me to find the Flame Pearl, I would have to tear down your Castle Peak Sect."
<br><br>"But before that, I'd better make a trip out of the city and look for other medicinal herbs!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng flew faster and faster in the sky.
<br><br>Just then, his speed dropped sharply and he looked at the sky not far away.
<br><br>"There are several breaths left fluctuations over there."
<br><br>"It seems that this breath, are very powerful ah!"
<br><br>"Let's go take a look first."
<br><br>With that, he moved his body and swept in the direction of the breath fluctuations.
