The atmosphere at the scene was rowdy, so the appearance of these six green-clothed men did not attract much attention.
<br><br>Only the people at the table that was scolded, inclined their heads back to look at these six green-clothed people.
<br><br>"What are you looking at, did you not hear me when I told you to get lost?"
<br><br>The green-clothed man sneered disdainfully and sent out a scolding voice.
<br><br>I did not expect a group of mole crickets, but actually let him speak to repeat a second time, really not open eyes.
<br><br>Once they heard this, the people at that table were also happy.
<br><br>The company also did not expect that in today's situation, there are still not open-minded to make trouble, this damn is not to play the King of Hell's small ding, want to enter the eighteen layers of hell?
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Mr. here, can not start a good thing is not to start a good thing.
<br><br>So even in the face of such offensive words, the table did not get angry, but one of the younger men rose to advise: "A few, suggest you go back where you came from, this is not a place where you are entitled to spill."
<br><br>"Eh?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the six green-clothed men were instantly annoyed.
<br><br>I didn't expect that a group of ants gathered in a broken tavern would say that they were not qualified to be wild here?
<br><br>This group of mole crickets, enough to float ah!
<br><br>They were worried that they couldn't find the ancient statue in Pingjiang City, so they didn't know how to go back and deliver the news, and they had a belly full of fire.
<br><br>This mole, didn't it bump into their guns?
<br><br>"Crush it to pieces!"
<br><br>One of the men in green moved his palm without warning and raised the corner of his ice-cold mouth.
<br><br>With a flip of his palm, he slapped a palm towards the young man's chest.
<br><br>Obviously, this was an absolute killing move.
<br><br>"Eh?"
<br><br>"Eight Life Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>The young man who got up to advise suddenly changed his face.
<br><br>It was also not expected that these six green-clothed people were actually also Martial Emperors, and even less expected that they actually had the guts to suddenly strike.
<br><br>He was one of the weaker ones in this hall, and only had the strength of a six-life Martial Emperor himself, so he didn't catch the slap at first, and flew out backwards.
<br><br>It was a good coincidence that it smashed on the table of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who was raising his wine glass and clinking glasses with others, was splattered all over by the smashed rice and held his glass in place.
<br><br>The sudden change of events, making the scene of the atmosphere suddenly a quiet.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The field can hear a pin drop.
<br><br>Even the leaves blown by the wind on the street outside the door, rubbing on the ground also became extremely ear-piercing.
<br><br>A pair of nervous and frightened eyes, fell on Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>Nerves, too, collectively popped up to the brain!
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Sitting dumbfounded, Yi Feng looked up and down at the scraps on his body, and then looked at the young man who fell at his feet, and his face gradually sank.
<br><br>Once this face sank, all the pupils concerned about Yi Feng's face, are shrinking.
<br><br>At the same time the hearts of all people, can not help but a thud.
<br><br>It's over!
<br><br>Something big has happened!
<br><br>Many people, forehead has been cold sweat.
<br><br>Sir, I'm afraid to be angry.
<br><br>This Immortal River Continent, can it withstand the wrath of the gentleman?
<br><br>"Pah!"
<br><br>In an instant, dozens of pairs of chopsticks fell at the same time, dozens of figures stood up in unison.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>The ungrateful thing, and actually offended the head of the gentleman, unforgivable.
<br><br>The crowd in the field is full of anger, a pair of killing intent eyes focused on the six men in green.
<br><br>Facing these sixty gazes, the six men in black somehow got a fierce chill down their backs, as if dozens of flooded beasts were staring at them.
<br><br>"What's going on, it's obviously a group of mole crickets, why do I have a feeling of fear?" A man in green couldn't help but say.
<br><br>"Yes, it feels a little bit wrong, just now that slap, obviously can beat that guy into nothingness, but did not expect only a little lightly wounded." Another man in green also could not help but say.
<br><br>"What are you afraid of, we are six Eight Life Martial Emperors, can't we still do anything to us?" Another green-clothed person coldly snorted and said disdainfully, "Even if there are a few hidden experts among them, how strong can this kind of bullet-ridden place be?"
<br><br>At these words, the remaining few green-clothed men nodded their heads.
<br><br>What they said was also true.
<br><br>They were Eight Life Martial Emperors, they could pretty much walk across the entire continent, could they still capsize in such a small place?
<br><br>Once they thought of this, the six were not afraid anymore, instead they raised their proud heads and stared at the crowd and drank: "What are you staring at, just a bunch of ants, do you still want to make a move?"
