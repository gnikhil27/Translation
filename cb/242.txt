But what she didn't expect was that the old men just smiled at her.
<br><br>Not the slightest intention to apologize.
<br><br>That pork rong even pressed her head with one hand, pushed her behind, and lectured, "Old men do things, little hairy children go behind."
<br><br>Li Yihan's eyes widened.
<br><br>These old men.
<br><br>What the hell is going on?
<br><br>Was it a head twitch?
<br><br>She easily fought for the opportunity to understand from Cheng Wu, these old men actually do not know how to cherish.
<br><br>But what she didn't expect was that these old men not only didn't apologize, but instead, they continued to bellow at Cheng Wu and the others, "You little brats, you have a quarter of an hour to leave here, or else you will die en masse."
<br><br>Ka!
<br><br>Hearing this sentence. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Li Yihan was even more frightened, his face was white and his heart was beating straight.
<br><br>Because with this one sentence, they had not only offended the original Cheng Wu, but all the sect disciples present.
<br><br>This, but there are many of the pride of heaven ah, she Li Yihan placed in the most can only be considered a mid-stream level.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>This sentence, completely ignited the anger of everyone present.
<br><br>Some people in the field swords move together, killing intent straight surge.
<br><br>Normally, they were all proud and arrogant within the sect, so how could they stand a few old men they didn't even know shouting at them.
<br><br>"Oh, actually want to make a move?"
<br><br>Porky Rong gave these people a disdainful look.
<br><br>"Old man, quickly kneel down and confess your sins, or else, let you die without a burial place." Cheng Wu shouted coldly.
<br><br>"Confess your sins?"
<br><br>Porky Rong sneered, "Why should I confess my sins?"
<br><br>"You, there are so many of us, aren't you afraid?" Cheng Wu shouted in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Afraid?"
<br><br>Pork Rong snorted, shook his head with a face full of mockery, and said, "We are not afraid of you, because in our opinion, all of you present are trash!"
<br><br>With this one sentence, the crowd that was already enraged exploded directly.
<br><br>"Brothers, these few people are too arrogant, whatever they are, cut them down."
<br><br>"Yes, kill them."
<br><br>"Let's go together."
<br><br>At once, hundreds of disciples in the field swept up into the air and raised the swords in their hands and slashed towards the six Pork Rong people.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Li Yihan's face turned white with fear, clenched her teeth and drank with hatred, "You guys are like this, really, no one can really save you."
<br><br>Saying that, she shook her head and closed her eyes, retreating to the side.
<br><br>She couldn't figure out, these old men were quite normal before, what kind of drugs are they taking tonight to be this deadly.
<br><br>In this situation, she was simply powerless.
<br><br>She has given up.
<br><br>The crowd swept the air is already to the head of Pork Rong and others, a fierce and fierce, killing intent straight surge.
<br><br>However, the six people did not change their faces.
<br><br>Until these people are getting closer and closer, the leader of the old man Wang's cloudy gaze only slightly moved.
<br><br>A monstrous aura burst out violently in his body.
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>This aura was like a shocking wave that rolled up a huge storm and lunged towards these charging sect disciples.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, these disciples' faces changed drastically, swords flying in their hands, and people flipping over, turning into a stream of light and flying backwards in unison.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>A time, screams of misery, one after another, all spitting blood, hit the ground heavily, eyes full of fear.
<br><br>And Li Yihan, who had closed his eyes, also sensed the change.
<br><br>Suddenly opened his eyes.
<br><br>It was just in time to see the scene of hundreds of elite disciples falling on their backs, one by one flying out backwards.
<br><br>Such a scene was like an explosive thunderstorm in her mind.
<br><br>The cold air in her mouth straight pumping, her heart is about to jump out to come, all body straight shivering.
<br><br>These old men ......
<br><br>These old men actually ......
<br><br>actually ......
<br><br>How can.
<br><br>How is it possible?
<br><br>These few old men, who had spent so many days with her and looked like mortals, were actually super strong!
<br><br>Relying on a mere aura, they would collectively vibrate hundreds of the sect's elite disciples away?
<br><br>You should know that the strongest of these disciples were Martial Emperor powerhouses.
<br><br>And to be able to shake a Martial Emperor with his qi, doesn't that mean that these old men are at least at the level of Martial Zong?
<br><br>The Martial Arts Sect!
<br><br>When she thought of this, Li Yihan's heart jumped and she didn't dare to look at these old men with her gaze for a while.
<br><br>Because she remembered this way down, she scolded these old men, and also taught these old men how to behave, and called them mortal ......
<br><br>Mortals.
<br><br>Have you ever seen such a strong mortal?
<br><br>Can't help but, her paws subconsciously took two steps back, her face was pale and she felt her scalp tingling.
<br><br>Herself in their eyes, just jumping clown right!
<br><br>No wonder.
<br><br>No wonder they dare to come from Pingjiang City to Nansha, and also look like they are not afraid, so they are such experts.
<br><br>It's also no wonder that in the face of Cheng Wu and their elite disciples, they were not the least bit afraid.
<br><br>"Who the hell are you people?"
<br><br>At this time, the injured crowd of disciples climbed up and stared at Old Man Wang and the others with a face full of hatred, and sullenly drank: "You are looking for trouble from our major sects for no reason, and what exactly is the reason, do you know that the experts of our major sects are nearby, aren't you afraid of the retaliation from our sects?"
<br><br>"Retaliation?"
<br><br>Pork Rong sneered and said disdainfully, "I'm not afraid to tell you that not only are you trash in our eyes, the sects behind you are equally trash in our eyes!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"Really not afraid of the wind blowing your tongue."
<br><br>At these words, these clan disciples were so angry that they vomited blood.
<br><br>"Well, well, in that case, then have the guts to stay here and don't run!"
<br><br>The crowd shouted with faces full of hatred.
<br><br>As he spoke, Cheng Wu directly took out a signal bomb and directly fired it.
<br><br>And another disciple from the Snow Blowing Villa similarly pulled the emergency signal of their clan.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"It's actually a red signal!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Li Yihan's eyes immediately widened.
<br><br>As a native of Nansha, she knew very well what this red signal represented, only disciples who encountered an emergency crisis and had a deep hatred would pull it off.
<br><br>And the result, basically, is not dead or rest!
<br><br>This is really a big deal.
<br><br>She clenched her shell teeth, hesitated for a long time, and finally mustered up the courage to walk over towards Pork Rong a few people.
<br><br>"Before, seniors ......"
<br><br>She did not dare to confront the gaze of these few people, more afraid of these few experts looking for her to settle accounts, so at the moment she is completely hard-headed to say.
<br><br>"Seniors, you are not natives of Nansha, I'm afraid you do not know what the red signal represents, you'd better hurry up and leave!"
<br><br>"No need to leave, we'll just wait for them here." Wu Yonghong said with a faint smile.
<br><br>At those words, Li Yihan's face looked anxious.
<br><br>It seemed that these old men still didn't know the seriousness of the matter, even though she knew that these people were strong, but could they be stronger than the big clan in Nansha?
<br><br>So she hurriedly explained: "Senior, they are the people of the South Sand big power Feng Yun Valley and Blowing Snow Villa, not only are there countless Martial Sect experts in their clan, there are also many Martial Exalted experts, if you don't leave, when their experts arrive later, I'm afraid you won't be able to leave."
