"Kacha!"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie was directly stuck in his throat by this light-hearted sentence.
<br><br>But in the blink of an eye, he shook his head violently, filled with disbelief.
<br><br>"No, it's impossible."
<br><br>"How can there be a god in this world?"
<br><br>"And how could I, Li Mo Xie, come across a god, and even if he was a god, how could he run to this little Pingjiang City."
<br><br>God!
<br><br>What is a god?
<br><br>God is an existence that is countless times more advanced than immortality, in charge of the laws of heaven and earth, even if it is a Martial Emperor, in front of God, it is just the same as an ant.
<br><br>How could this kind of existence, which is so advanced that it transcends the realm, stoop to such a place?
<br><br>"There is nothing impossible about it." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Under the black robe, eerie words came out, saying leisurely, "After all, as the master's servant, I am also a god!"
<br><br>"You bullshit!"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie shouted madly: "You think God is a cabbage, everywhere?"
<br><br>"Jie Jie ......"
<br><br>In response to Li Moxie, there was an eerie laugh, and under the slightly raised black robe, the jaws of the skull head seemed to be slightly raised again.
<br><br>Subsequently, that large black robe sleeve a wave.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>With a roar, a heavenly thunder descended on Li Mo Xie, and at the same time a torrential downpour fell in the area around him.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>But in the next instant, the torrential rain stopped abruptly, and extreme cold ice spread across the sky, and Li Mo Xie was instantly frozen into an ice sculpture.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>After another moment, the sky was enveloped by roaring flames, and Li Mo Xie, who had just become an ice sculpture, was instantly roasted again with blood and flesh.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>The fire just extinguished, another gust of wind covered Li Moxie, under this strong hurricane, Li Moxie's entire body turned twisted.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh ......"
<br><br>Intense pain, so that Li Moxie mouth issued a shocking scream, in just a split second, Li Mo suffered the baptism of wind, fire and lightning.
<br><br>Under this baptism, Li Moxie's whole person turned into broken, while his eyes showed fear, while staring at the black-robed man shivering: "Natural ...... natural law, this is the legendary natural law?"
<br><br>"So, do you believe it?"
<br><br>"Still don't believe it ......"
<br><br>Before the voice had finished, the black-robed man raised his palm again violently.
<br><br>For a moment, Li Mo Xie's pupils widened, because at that moment he felt time flying by, instantly experiencing countless springs, summers, autumns and winters, while his own skin and body were also rapidly aging.
<br><br>"Ahhhhh!"
<br><br>Miserable screams emanated from Li Mo Xie's mouth, his eyes filled with blood, because the means of the black-robed man in front of him was not the pain acting on his body, but the psychological fear.
<br><br>Imagine what it is like for a person to even be able to see the passage of time with the naked eye, to watch his body grow old with the naked eye.
<br><br>"This is the law of time, you actually, you actually are really a god?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie stared at his pupils, his body was trembling violently.
<br><br>He wanted very much to live, but now he couldn't even rise the thought of escaping, and his heart was turning blue with remorse.
<br><br>He never thought that he was actually not open-minded enough to plunder God's things, to plunder God's qi?
<br><br>This is not to play the King of Hell's bird - looking for death!
<br><br>But on the other hand, he was not willing to.
<br><br>This damn, how bad luck must have, to kick such a thick iron plate.
<br><br>"Forget it, die!"
<br><br>The black-robed man seems to have no more interest in Li Moxie, the palm of his hand out of thin air, Li Moxie's body burst with a bang, without even leaving a bubble, it turned into nothingness.
<br><br>"Run, run, run, hurry up."
<br><br>And this side of the scene, the whole time by hiding in the dark Lu Dasheng saw, although he could not feel the flow of laws around Li Moxie, but Li Moxie body cultivation he could feel clearly.
<br><br>The martial arts expert.
<br><br>However, this black-robed man easily killed him, does not that mean that the black-robed man in front of him is at least a Martial Zun, or Martial Saint expert?
<br><br>So, afraid of being implicated, Lu Dasheng no longer cared to watch the show, pulled his legs and ran.
<br><br>But just as he moved, he felt that his body was deep in the mud and could not move.
<br><br>Then, a big hand appeared behind him and grabbed him directly. Lu Dasheng was scared out of his mind and wailed, "Senior, senior I'm wrong, I was just passing by!"
