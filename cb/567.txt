Yi Feng was torn about this matter of randomly teleporting to the Immortal World.
<br><br>He lay in bed and tossed and turned for a long time.
<br><br>This dog system is completely unreasonable and has many pits. But good things are not absent.
<br><br>Yi Feng rolled over and propped himself up to look at the green fields sprouting in the backyard.
<br><br>A little hope was kindled again.
<br><br>You see, such a bad place, the seeds of redemption can be rooted and sprouted, the sapling also draws a strip.
<br><br>There is also a human immortal cultivation that he got for nothing.
<br><br>Yi Feng clenched his fist and thought.
<br><br>That is to say, this system sometimes, a small part of the time ...... it is not so pit.
<br><br>Thinking for a long time, Yi Feng sat up from the bed, his gaze gradually firm up.
<br><br>Pit or not, try to know. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After all, for him to be able to teleport out of this damn place, is dreaming ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng decided, this deal, he made a decision!
<br><br>Just ...... qi luck points where to get?
<br><br>He remembered ...... the source of qi luck points before, it was his own apprentice broke into fame.
<br><br>Only a short time ago, it was from the Immortal River continent.
<br><br>As for how to come, do not know.
<br><br>But break out of fame ...... disciple can, he himself can, right?
<br><br>Yi Feng got off the bed and began to wear wolf skin.
<br><br>He now wants to go out and try to break in.
<br><br>Shadow Island is an immortal world, if he breaks out of fame, then the system must give a little more, right?
<br><br>With uncertainty and expectation, Yi Feng walked out of the house where he had been gou for a long time.
<br><br>A wind blew Yi Feng wrapped his wolf skin tightly and headed for the depths of the gale.
<br><br>......
<br><br>...... The wind was smaller at noon, and after Yi Feng walked past the Gobi shrubs, he saw a sky full of vultures flying around and owls screaming.
<br><br>The hissing pierced the sky and covered the sound of the wind.
<br><br>A snake from the sand and soil spitting letters towards Yi Feng crawl.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked down and saw, startled, the mutated desert too climbing snake.
<br><br>This snake Yi Feng know, highly toxic ah ...... he carefully took a stick to sweep the snake away, "Get out of the way, or get you killed."
<br><br>The snake was driven away, Yi Feng took two steps forward before seeing the vulture flying around under a man who was waving his hand to drive the vulture.
<br><br>Now has been torn by the vulture's body is full of blood, shaking.
<br><br>It looks like the vulture was hungry for too long and couldn't wait for the person to die, so he came to eat it.
<br><br>Can be in this dark shadow island, how is also immortal. Immortals here can not use the cultivation and mortals are no different, they are bullied by these animals!
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng's righteousness immediately surrounded him.
<br><br>Happy to help others is his motto to carry out his life!
<br><br>Of course, it is best to earn Qi luck points ...... by the way, after all, help people is not.
<br><br>Yi Feng took off the wolf skin on his body and went forward, waving the wolf skin to drive away the vultures.
<br><br>The vulture raptor tore him, he was a wolf skin fan dead.
<br><br>The backhand is a wolf skin again!
<br><br>After a few fans, the vultures were slapped to death all over the ground, and the others saw that the situation was not right and flew away. To the side to watch.
<br><br>Driven away the vulture, Yi Feng looked at the man next to him has been covered in blood body exhaustion fell to sit down.
<br><br>"This brother is all right?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>Looking at the man covered in blood and gasping for air, Yi Feng immediately felt that he asked the question has a problem.
<br><br>So he changed his tone and said, "Brother looks not too good ah ...... want to go to my place to recuperate for two days?"
<br><br>The man shook his head, hoarse voice breathlessly returned, "Thank you for saving me, but I'm afraid I can't repay my benefactor because of my inability to Feng."
<br><br>"No need to repay. It is my principle to help when I see injustice." Yi Feng said politely.
<br><br>While talking, side ears expecting the system's voice to come out - for being helpful to reward Qi luck 500 points or something.
<br><br>For a long time, there was nothing.
<br><br>The man raised his head and looked at the vulture with fierce eyes in the distance.
<br><br>"I remember the heart of the benefactor to save me, but the benefactor should go." He said, "Look at those vultures, there just waiting for me to die."
<br><br>"If you take me away, you will become tired, and if once you are tired, these vultures will swarm and eat you and me." The man said, "Your Grace go now."
<br><br>"What about you when I leave?" It's not that Yi Feng didn't think about leaving.
<br><br>After all, waiting for half a day there was no sound in his head of the system rewarding Qi luck points.
<br><br>This made him realize that the act of being helpful does not earn qi luck points.
<br><br>"Go one to live one." The man said, his gaze desperate and sad, "eat me, feed these beasts, the benefactor will not be in danger."
<br><br>The man urged, looking at Yi Feng, "En-gong hurry up and go!"
<br><br>"That said ......" Yi Feng murmured, putting on his clothes, "Although it does not move me. But to be able to say this, I think you are also a person who repays virtue with virtue."
<br><br>He said, helping the man up, "I'll take you away."
<br><br>The red-eyed black snake with spitting letters was getting closer and closer. It hid under the sand and wriggled, making it hard to notice.
<br><br>"Don't worry, these vultures come one I kill one." Yi Feng said while holding up the man and preparing to take him away, "Not to mention these vultures, even a pack of wolves came, I can also keep you safe."
<br><br>The man pushed Yi Feng away violently, and he looked at the wolf skin on Yi Feng's body and stared at it with wide eyes.
<br><br>"This is a wolf skin!?" He was stunned, and then he raised his head and looked at Yi Feng seriously.
<br><br>"Did you kill it?"
<br><br>"What else?" Yi Feng calmly returned, he patted the head wolf skin on his body, "Not bragging, such a wolf skin, I have a bunch of them at home. Even burning fire and cooking rice is too burnt to smell heavy."
<br><br>Shadow wolves on this island mean something men know very well!
<br><br>The head wolf that can be hunted and killed must use cultivation. On this Shadow Island using cultivation can still be safe and sound ......
<br><br>He had never heard of such a big man in the immortal world!
<br><br>"I am Fengjiang, dare to ask the senior respect is?" The man tried his best to stand up straight with no strength and asked Yi Feng with a salute.
<br><br>"I am Yi Feng." Yi Feng also returned his salute to him.
<br><br>"Yi Feng ......" Fengjiang muttered, suddenly thought of something and looked at him with wide eyes, "Yi Feng?! You are Mr. Yi!!!"
<br><br>Not long ago, a new force appeared in the Immortal World. Everywhere the force went immortals, no matter how powerful, were subservient.
<br><br>Its forces in the immortal world continents turn their hands into clouds and overturn their hands into rain, and all the immortals everywhere they go have heard of their name.
<br><br>But the disciples of Mr. Yi, the head of the Heaven and Earth Sect of the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>To ask Mr. Yi is what is sacred, the surname Yi single name a maple.
<br><br>Feng Jiang's stunned gaze was followed by the surprise of a great opportunity, a time to forget their own body injuries, full of excitement.
<br><br>"Yeah? Hometown? You know me?" Yi Feng was also surprised and happy at the same time. You know how hard it is to meet someone in this shitty place.
<br><br>It's even more difficult to meet a hometown!
<br><br>"Of course!!!" Feng Jiang was surprised, "Who would not know Mr. Yi's great name! Immortal River Continent Heaven and Earth Sect's head of ah!"
<br><br>Sure enough old hometown, Yi Feng's face also put on a happy color,.
<br><br>"Really is the immortal river continent hometown ah, do not know where you heard about me?" Yi Feng complacency asked "Feng brother is not the people of Pingjiang City?"
<br><br>You should know that since he became a martial emperor, can fly in the sky in Pingjiang City every day.
<br><br>So worship their own look ...... seems to be the people of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"It seems you don't know that your ......"
<br><br>'Disciple' two words have not yet spoken, Fengjiang teeth clenched, fiercely sucked back a breath of cold air.
<br><br>Then fell backwards ......
<br><br>Yi Feng dumbfounded, rushed forward to check, suddenly a shadow from under Fengjiang arrow shot at him!
<br><br>Yi Feng reacted very quickly to grab the shadow fell out, only to see is a familiar snake.
<br><br>Ah ...... is that he swept away the mutant Tai Pan Snake!
<br><br>When it was too late, he jumped up and stepped on it, and then jumped stomp hard!
<br><br>Although his own cultivation can not, but to talk about martial arts, that is the height of the system certification and God compared!
<br><br>Yi Feng gritted his teeth until his feet were a bloody blur, only then gasped and stopped.
<br><br>"It's a pity ......" he looked at the corpse of Fengjiang lying on the ground, "only to meet a brother, not only is the hometown of Pingjiang City, but also conquered by my awesome, in the twinkling of an eye."
<br><br>"It's a pity ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng long sigh, with a deep regret.
