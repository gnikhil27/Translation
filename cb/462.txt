Dongsheng.
<br><br>"I, Hu Hansan, am back!"
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted excitedly.
<br><br>After waiting for these few days, he finally got the disciple token at the Green Bull Sect.
<br><br>Not only that.
<br><br>With this sect disciple tag, the first time he returned to Eastern Victory, he went to the Eastern Victory Sect Alliance and successfully got the sect establishment permit.
<br><br>"Although it's only a ninth grade sect, it doesn't matter!"
<br><br>Looking at the permission paperwork in his hand, Yi Feng's heart was happy.
<br><br>After he went back and established the sect, he could cultivate as long as he took in a hundred disciples.
<br><br>Flight, longevity, and dual cultivation were all beckoning to him!
<br><br>Two days later, Yi Feng returned to the island. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"It's still good for Dongsheng."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at these old men and women who greeted him, Yi Feng felt extraordinarily affectionate.
<br><br>And in these days of his absence, the construction of the island had been completely finished.
<br><br>Not only that.
<br><br>Those old men and women from Pingjiang City even spontaneously built houses around Yi Feng's clan.
<br><br>So nowadays, the island is bustling with activity, and there are bamboo rafts floating by on the river from time to time.
<br><br>"Aiya, it seems that I really found a feng shui treasure ah, so many old men and women like this place."
<br><br>"But it's good to be lively!"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>And after returning to the island, Yi Feng could not wait for the establishment of the clan.
<br><br>Immediately, the core staff of the sect was called.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The core ones were just a few.
<br><br>Qing Huan phase, Zhong Qing, Lu Qingshan, Xiaodai, Wu Changan, Guan Yunpeng, Ye Bei, Shake the Sky Que and a few others.
<br><br>"En, just now I looked, today is a good day, choose the day, the sect will be established today."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, "Of course, in the future, the sect will need everyone's cooperation when it runs."
<br><br>"Guan Yunpeng, Ye Bei, Shake the Sky Que."
<br><br>"Present."
<br><br>"You three will manage the day-to-day matters clan facilities construction ah, new disciples come in to arrange housing ah and so on." Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The three people were excited.
<br><br>Totally did not expect that they were actually able to serve inside Yi Feng's sect.
<br><br>"En, old Qing, this time you find back the books are good, quite to my satisfaction, so this collection of scripture pavilion of the elders, let you be!" Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang nodded respectfully and answered.
<br><br>"En, that's it then!"
<br><br>After arranging all this, Yi Feng was ready to leave, after all, there were just a few people, so it was almost enough.
<br><br>After all, these are not important.
<br><br>What was important was that he had to hurry up and collect a hundred disciples and set out on the path of cultivation as soon as possible, so he ignored even what the opening ceremony and all that, and just set up the sect.
<br><br>"Uh, sir, then what is the name of our clan?" Qing Huan Xiang hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>"Oops, forgot about that." Yi Feng slapped his head and hurriedly said, "Then what do you guys think would be a better name?"
<br><br>"This, we still have to ask sir to decide."
<br><br>Several people respectfully lowered their heads.
<br><br>Yi Feng thought about it and felt that they were all similar, so he took one at random and said, "Let's call it Heaven and Earth Gate!"
<br><br>No other reason, just simply feel that this name is atmospheric enough.
<br><br>And just at the next moment when Yi Feng decided on the name of the sect, a familiar voice rang out in his mind.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, creating a sect successfully, rewarding a flying sword."
<br><br>"Binding Heaven and Earth Sect in ......"
<br><br>"Heaven and Earth Sect bound successfully."
<br><br>"Disciple: 3/100."
<br><br>"Disciples successfully reached 100, the host will open cultivation."
