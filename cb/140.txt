"So did you find out what caused it or not?" Yan snatched the demon emperor and asked again.
<br><br>"There should be a problem with the water source." Another Forgotten River Demon Emperor said, "All the demon beasts that drank the mountain spring water, without exception, found this situation!"
<br><br>"Water source?"
<br><br>"How could there be a problem with the water source."
<br><br>Yan snatched the demon emperor more gloomy, although they have cultivated as demons, but still can not lack of water, this water source has a problem, is simply to shave their roots.
<br><br>"I see, it has something to do with the Bo Gu territory!"
<br><br>At this time, the Forgotten River Demon Emperor shrunk his pupils and said gruffly, "Ever since something happened to the Bo Gu territory, this mountain has become uneventful."
<br><br>"But, didn't we, along with the entire Shogun's demon beasts, launch an extermination order, could it be that the matter at Boku's place hasn't been settled yet?" Yan Snatcher Demon Emperor asked again.
<br><br>His question immediately ushered in the blank stares of several other Demon Emperors.
<br><br>"Your news here is really backward, Bo Gu territory in addition to still exist some small demons, has become a dead land, not only Bo Gu disappeared without a trace, even the eighteen demon kings in his territory also disappeared, but according to the news sent back by our territory demon king, these eighteen demon kings should be fatal, and should be wiped out, and even have no room to resist the That kind!" Another Liu Yang Demon King frowned and said with a face full of gloom.
<br><br>"What?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The Yan snatching Demon Emperor was stunned, and a cold sweat could not help but gush out behind him.
<br><br>He never thought that the Bo Gu territory, which he wanted to be neighboring, was actually exterminated so coldly?
<br><br>"Could it be that the humans made a move against us?" Yan snatched the Demon Emperor swallowed a mouthful of saliva and boldly asked.
<br><br>"It should be unlikely."
<br><br>Liu Yang Demon Emperor shook his head and said, "The great war between my demon world and humans has long stopped for many years, and also long ago set an agreement that well water does not offend river water, although there are usually some small friction, and even humans have always wanted to exterminate us, but they also do not have the guts at all, after all, the real war, humans absolutely can not afford the price."
<br><br>"And if this matter is really done by humans, and also exterminate a demon emperor territory in the hall, it is undoubtedly a war to our entire South Sand Demon Realm."
<br><br>"Therefore, they definitely do not dare!"
<br><br>At these words, the demon emperors nodded their heads.
<br><br>After all, this kind of thing involving a race war, no one would dare to provoke it.
<br><br>Even they, the demon emperors, who usually wanted to fight tooth and nail, only dared to steal two heads in a human village, not daring to make a big move at all.
<br><br>However, just at this time, a small demon from the Yan Capture territory rushed over and even rolled twice on the ground in a panic.
<br><br>"Great King, Great King is not good, there is a large army of humans in our territory, and there are many human Martial Spirit Martial Kings and other experts in the sky!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The news that came from the little demon immediately made the demon emperors present astonished.
<br><br>Just as they were incredulous, several more little demons hurriedly came running and kneeled on the ground to hastily report.
<br><br>"Report! Demon Emperor Changgeng, a large number of human clan disciples have also been found in our territory!"
<br><br>"Report! Liu Yang Demon Emperor, human clan disciples have also appeared in our territory, and I'm afraid there are as many as 100,000 of them. In addition to human demon spirits and demon kings, the fluctuations of Martial Emperor experts have also been found over here."
<br><br>"Report! Forgetting River Demon Emperor, also in our territory, and the little demons of the territory have already had a small-scale battle with them."
<br><br>As soon as these voices came, they completely shocked these Demon Emperors and made their faces pale.
<br><br>"It's going to change."
<br><br>"Humans!"
<br><br>"Really declared war on our Southern Sand Demon Realm!"
<br><br>Several demon emperors looked at me, I looked at you, all of them were full of gloom.
<br><br>Human armies, clan disciples, Martial Spirit Martial Kings, and even Martial Emperor experts comparable to them, the Demon Emperors, were all out in force.
<br><br>This is not a declaration of war, what is it?
<br><br>"Damn humans, really despicable, first coldly exterminating the Bo Gu territory, then putting their hands in our Shogun's water supply, then taking advantage of our unpreparedness and sending a human army to invade, all of this, really good tactics!"
<br><br>"It's really despicable, it's good that we found out early, otherwise we wouldn't have known if the fight had come to our doorstep."
<br><br>"Good, if we had found out a little bit later, then we would have been the next Bo Gu territory!"
<br><br>Can't help but, a cold sweat broke out on the many demon emperors.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>"Take an idea!"
<br><br>The demon emperors said as they exchanged glances.
<br><br>"Hmph, so what if there are human Martial Emperors, a million or so human armies, exterminate him!"
<br><br>"Yes, exterminate him, it's simply too much to bully the demons!"
<br><br>"Yes, in our territory, we are still afraid of them?"
<br><br>At one time, the crowd of demon emperors have come out indignant voice.
