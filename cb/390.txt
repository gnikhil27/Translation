This time.
<br><br>Finally, it came to the island without any half-assed accident.
<br><br>The sun was warming up.
<br><br>It corresponded to Su Xuanjun's rather happy mood.
<br><br>He wandered around the island, and no one seemed to notice his presence, which made him quite bold.
<br><br>"I left in haste last time, so I can observe properly this time."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun carefully surveyed every person on the island.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor."
<br><br>"Another Martial Emperor."
<br><br>"This one, the Human Immortal realm."
<br><br>While surveying the people on the island, Su Xuanjun secretly recorded, and after one round, he raised the corners of his mouth. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"This kind of lineup is really not bad for this lower realm, but for me, it's really not good either!"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun sneered.
<br><br>As the Lord of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, the last thing he lacked was subordinates, and the human immortals on this island were not even qualified to be his subordinates.
<br><br>"So much for this island, have I been too cautious this whole time?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun muttered to himself.
<br><br>"But it's always right to be careful, it's always right to be careful with anything."
<br><br>He lifted his head and just saw a bamboo raft floating on the water in the distance.
<br><br>It was the same old man he had seen holding the boat when he first landed on the island. This made him slightly cautious, and his divine soul body concealed itself in the shadows.
<br><br>"Qinghuan phase, in the end, is it you!"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun sized up the old man holding the boat, and mouthed this name that made him also scare for it.
<br><br>With that, he gritted his teeth slightly and looked straight ahead.
<br><br>"If it really is him, I am bound to be able to detect it by looking straight at him like this."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Straight gaze straight for a long time, the old man who supported the boat still sat on the boat without movement, his mind on the fishing rod in his hands, seemingly not half aware of Su Xuanjun's presence.
<br><br>"Could it be that last time it was my illusion?"
<br><br>"Is this just an ordinary old man?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun committed a muttering, simply out of the shadows, not the slightest hidden stood on the shore.
<br><br>But the old man who was holding the boat, still did not have a half-hearted response.
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>"It's ridiculous to say, I actually scared myself, really thought you were some kind of Qing Huan phase."
<br><br>This made Su Xuanjun laughed directly, and his heart relaxed directly.
<br><br>At this very moment, the floating drift moved continuously.
<br><br>Obviously there are fish hooked.
<br><br>The old man who supported the boat hastily raised the bamboo pole in his hand, a small fish slightly larger than a fingernail cap, along with the fishing wire broke the water.
<br><br>"Jumping is quite happy, but is a tadpole, no wonder the gentleman is not even interested in lifting the rod."
<br><br>"Let yourself bounce around!"
<br><br>The old man couldn't help but shake his head, took off the small fish on the hook, casually threw it back into the lake, and continued fishing with his eyes closed.
<br><br>"That monk actually disappeared, or I can also take a good look at whether he is that person or not."
<br><br>"But the odds are that it's also because I was nervous last time and misidentified him as well."
<br><br>"Then in that case, the only one on this island who is not sure is that youth."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's pupils shrank slightly, and when he looked around, he spotted the trail on the shore not far away.
<br><br>He approached with big steps and once again began to test.
<br><br>Only this time, the test was quite a bit bolder than before, and he actually came directly within a hundred feet of Yi Feng.
<br><br>"If you're really strong, even if you can't detect my presence, you can at least detect the fluctuations."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun continued testing with the same method.
<br><br>The method was simple, but it was actually effective.
<br><br>After a series of tests, Yi Feng's reaction was likewise not beyond his expectation, and there was still no half-hearted reaction to his presence.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"It's really all a bunch of hot chickens, actually causing me to spend so much time."
<br><br>He was both hated and angry at the result.
<br><br>It was extremely humiliating to think that he, the continental lord of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, was actually frightened by a group of mole crickets from the lower realm and did not dare to go out for a month in seclusion.
<br><br>Under the anger, in the retreat room of the Immortal Realm, Su Xuanjun violently opened his eyes and his true body instantly disappeared.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, he crossed countless mountains and waters and arrived at the barrier between the two realms.
<br><br>With one step, he stepped into the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>At the same instant Su Xuanjun descended into the Immortal River Continent, countless pairs of eyes opened everywhere in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>The moment the eyes opened, the entire Immortal River Continent was swirling with clouds and dark clouds.
<br><br>"It's really lively ......"
<br><br>Among the top of the clouds, a stunning-looking woman raised her red lips.
<br><br>--.
<br><br>In the land of magma, under a pair of scarlet eyes, a murmuring voice came out.
<br><br>"Immortal world, finally noticed?"
<br><br>"But the Immortal Irrigation has restarted for no reason, it seems reasonable that the Immortal Realm has noticed, besides it's just a small role, no need to take it to heart."
<br><br>After saying that, the pair of scarlet eyes closed again.
<br><br>--
<br><br>In another place where the sky is cold, the ice mountain shakes the sky and cracks open.
<br><br>"Is the reopening of the Irrigation of Immortality purposely done by the Immortal Realm, or is it someone else?"
<br><br>"But whatever the reason, in addition to those few, many other old guys, I'm afraid they will also slowly awaken!"
<br><br>"I really do not know, who laughs to the end it ......"
<br><br>The voice came out leisurely, then gradually fell silent, the cracked iceberg actually also re-synthesized together.
<br><br>--
<br><br>In the endless black sea, a huge whirlpool appeared.
<br><br>"Countless reincarnators will awaken, they are the meat and potatoes, Jie Jie Jie ......"
<br><br>"Go, find them and bring them here ......"
