Faced with Bai Shanyi's questioning, the two were flustered, but not too afraid.
<br><br>Instead, they arched their hands without being subservient.
<br><br>"Night Energy, Night Yi, meet the True Palace Goddess."
<br><br>"You have not answered my question." White shallow one pupils shrink, a body pressure towards the night can father and daughter two pressure collapse.
<br><br>Two people such as carrying a thousand pounds of weight, forehead cold sweat, almost to stand unstable.
<br><br>But still gritted his teeth and held on.
<br><br>"Forgive us for not being able to agree."
<br><br>The two said firmly.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Bai Shangyi glanced at them.
<br><br>"It is quite surprising to me, it seems that not all of you in the North Sea are trash, at least there are still one or two with backbone." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Bai Shanyi's words made the other people's faces ugly to the extreme, but did not dare to refute at all.
<br><br>"But even having a backbone is not a reason for you to disobey!"
<br><br>Bai Shallow One said indifferently, "Give you one more chance."
<br><br>"Submit, or die!"
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, a greater pressure of might swept over the two Night Energy.
<br><br>"Ka ka ka!"
<br><br>Under the tremendous pressure, it was already beyond the limit of what the two could bear, the bones of their legs clicked, and their skin even oozed blood.
<br><br>But they still did not kneel down.
<br><br>"Sorry, we have someone we believe in long ago, we can't possibly submit to anyone but him."
<br><br>Night Energy raised his head and gritted his teeth, leading Night Yi to brace himself on the ground with difficulty, and a firm voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>This is their way.
<br><br>It was also a respect for the One in their hearts.
<br><br>As a believer, they, if a kneeling, the dao heart rupture future difficult to grow matter small, disobedient to the one is the matter big.
<br><br>Therefore, they have been taught by the gentleman, they do not allow their legs kneel in front of another person.
<br><br>"People who have faith early?"
<br><br>"So it is."
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi showed a taste of interest, but the next moment the tone of voice changed violently.
<br><br>"So what if someone does?"
<br><br>"In front of me, Bai Shao Yi, is just a bigger mole, if I want your lives today, who can protect you?"
<br><br>The words fell, a wave of the hand sleeve, two people flew out backwards, heavy impact on the side of the flying boat, spitting blood wretched to the extreme.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Night can deadly stare at white shallow one, said in a deep voice: "We died insignificant, but you insulted sir, when the crime deserves to die."
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>Bai Shallow laughed loudly and coldly and said, "Seeing you guys like this, I suddenly feel a hint of interest in you people behind this."
<br><br>Saying that, she raised her feet and slowly approached towards the father and daughter of Night Energy.
<br><br>"What do you want?"
<br><br>Night Neng stared at Bai Shanyi and asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"It just so happens that there is a shortage of slaves outside to work for me, so take you to test whether the one behind you, is qualified for the position."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi sneered, and two silver cold needles appeared in his hands.
<br><br>"Soul Suppressing Nails!"
<br><br>Seeing this, everyone present broke into a cold sweat.
<br><br>If this nail hit a person's body, it would seal off all of their meridians, and within seven days, they would suffer great pain, and their soul would fly away and die.
<br><br>"I would like to see if your man of faith can help you pull off this soul suppressing nail."
<br><br>With a single movement of Bai Shao Yi's palm, two Soul Suppressing Nails directly struck into the two people's brains.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Harsh miserable screams came out of the two people's mouths, and the cultivation on their bodies was rapidly dissipating.
<br><br>"Go on!"
<br><br>Bai Shangyi was indifferent to the two people's miserable screams, and with a wave of his palm, the two people flew out backwards and fell from the sky.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Watching the others body chills, body trembling.
<br><br>This woman's tactics, is really too ruthless.
<br><br>"What should we do?"
<br><br>In the dark, Jian Hengtian couldn't help but transmit a voice towards the other three, "Should we just watch this old man die?"
<br><br>"What else can we do?"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi said in a gruff voice: "This soul-suppressing nail we have only heard in the legends, simply never heard that it can be pulled down, even if the one from the Green Bull Sect to make a move, can still pull back the person in front of the God of Death?"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Several people's eyes showed hatred.
<br><br>But with their strength, they are completely powerless.
<br><br>The most conservative guess of Bai Shanyi's cultivation level was that of a Heavenly Immortal, and they, a small Martial Emperor, were undoubtedly no different from ants in front of her.
<br><br>"Remember, in the future, you will all work for my Bai Yang True Palace."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi gaze again to the crowd, said quietly: "For you bunch of trash, will be the glory of your life."
<br><br>The crowd hated the teeth, but did not dare to show the slightest refutation.
<br><br>The crowd's expressions were all in one place, and Bai Shao Yi smiled coldly and did not put it in his eyes.
<br><br>"Then next, present your first offerings!"
<br><br>"Bring out all your treasures, all of them."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"And offer up treasures?"
<br><br>The crowd was in an uproar.
<br><br>This was simply moving their lifeblood.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Don't want to?"
<br><br>Bai Shallow One said icily, "I can also choose to kill you and take it from above your corpses."
<br><br>This one sentence.
<br><br>It made the crowd feel like they were in a cave of ice.
<br><br>They had no doubt about this woman's tactics.
<br><br>For a time, even with all reluctance, the crowd handed over their storage rings one by one.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>The flying boat was piled with all kinds of treasures and skills, all of them were the treasures of the experts.
<br><br>But now, they are piled up together like rags.
<br><br>White shallow one was a faint glance, casually picked up a few pieces from it and put away after, will be the other all destroyed.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, many people in the field reveal the color of hatred, because this move is really too will not put them in the eyes.
<br><br>There can't help but want to make a move, well at the critical moment was pulled by his companions, which did not continue to happen bloodshed.
<br><br>"In the future, if there are things to do will notify you."
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>Destroyed all the treasures, continued to return to the first place to sit down, closed his eyes.
<br><br>A mountain range in the middle.
<br><br>Two shadows fell from the sky, smashing the ground into a large crater and raising skyward dust.
<br><br>Two figures with painful faces climbed up from inside the pit, it was the father and daughter of Night Energy.
<br><br>"Yi'er, hold back."
<br><br>"Come with me ...... with me to find Mr."
