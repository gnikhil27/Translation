The words fell.
<br><br>Three people's hearts set off waves of shock, face, also became full of death.
<br><br>Because what Li Mo Xie said is not wrong, this door big formation is so terrifying.
<br><br>Of course, the conditions are also very harsh, need to be in the 
<abbr title="Meanings: 2(number), Night, Cold(Winter),negative, wet, and feminine">yin</abbr> year, <abbr title="Meanings: 2(number), Night, Cold(Winter),negative, wet, and feminine">yin</abbr> month,<abbr title="Meanings: 2(number), Night, Cold(Winter),negative, wet, and feminine"> yin</abbr> day, <abbr title="Meanings: 2(number), Night, Cold(Winter),negative, wet, and feminine">yin</abbr> time, <abbr title="Meanings: 2(number), Night, Cold(Winter),negative, wet, and feminine">yin </abbr>moment to be able to last a moment.
<br><br>Originally the normal moment, Li Mo Xie even if this formation will be useless. But who would have thought that tomorrow is this rare date of ten thousand years?
<br><br>"By the way, I might as well tell you that I also know the secret method of taking away luck!" Li Mo Xie said again leisurely.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>This sentence, which fell on the ears of Wu Yonghong's three people, was like throwing down a heavy bomb.
<br><br>"You, you you, you are trying to, you are trying to deprive sir of his Qi luck?" Wu Yonghong trembled his lips and stared at Li Mo Xie with a deadly stare and said.
<br><br>"Unexpectedly ah Wu Yonghong, you're still quite smart, huh?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie said coldly: "That one is so powerful that even we can't see the cultivation level, and we don't know if it's a Martial Saint or Martial Emperor, plus countless treasures, this kind of person definately has heaven-defying great fortune."
<br><br>"And as long as I, Li Mo Xie, deprived him of his qi, maybe I can also step into the Martial Emperor in my lifetime, and even be able to become legendary Immortal Martial Artist."
<br><br>"You, last time you even got the martial intent passed out from mister Yi at the martial school, yet you are envious and dare to strike out at mister, I will fight with you."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong's neck turned red with anger.
<br><br>That day, he had not forgotten Yi Feng's generosity in giving him the divine rake, and even more so, he had not forgotten the benefits brought to him by feeling the martial intent at the martial arts school last time.
<br><br>So in a flash, his body's aura exploded out, and he even forcibly broke free from the restrictions of the formation and attacked towards Li Mo Xie.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>However, Li Mo Xie just casually waved his hand and interrupted Wu Yonghong's attack.
<br><br>"Do you really think that this formation is just for show?"
<br><br>Li Mo Xie laughed coldly.
<br><br>Sure enough, because of the breakaway just now, Wu Yonghong suffered a backlash from the formation and immediately spat out a large mouthful of blood.
<br><br>"That's fine, since you want to die, then I will satisfy you."
<br><br>Li Mo Xie moved his palm and a qi energy fell directly on top of Wu Yonghong's dantian.
<br><br>"padha...!"
<br><br>A bloody hole appeared, accompanied by an explosion, and Wu Yonghong stared in disbelief as Li Mo Xie directly nullified his cultivation.
<br><br>"Old Wu."
<br><br>"Old Wu."
<br><br>On the side, Chu Wild Lion and Sun Zhuge simultaneously emitted worried voices.
<br><br>"Originally, you could still live on for some more days, but there is nothing you can do if you seek your own death." Li Mo Xie laughed coldly, "Without your cultivation, in a few days, you will die as humble as a mortal!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>With a wild laugh, Li Mo Xie cut an arc in mid-air, then swept away in the direction of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>Ao Qing hadn't had a good time recently.
<br><br>Despite following Yi Feng's side with successive breakthroughs, the feeling that penetrated to him within that small door was just too unbearable.
<br><br>"Dog, what the hell is wrong with you, really so thirsty?" Yi Feng looked at the dog, palm gently <abbr title="If you see MC jerking dog, it means he is petting(damn translation)">petting</abbr> him, while saying, "Don't worry, when I am free, I will definitely help you out properly."
<br><br>However, the dog did not hear Yi Feng's words at all, those eyes were getting wider and wider, looking at the small wooden door behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>He always felt that what was inside that small wooden door was about to come out.
<br><br>In the end is it the <abbr title="dragon i suppose">flood beast</abbr>, or the absolute demon thing?
<br><br>He can't help but gulp a mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>"<abbr title="Creeeak">Creak!</abbr>"
<br><br>Sure enough, the small door creaked and gently pushed open.
<br><br>Ao Qing almost subconsciously shivered, his body hair stood erect, and his eyes stared deadly.
