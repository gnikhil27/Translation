But yet.
<br><br>What she didn't expect was that she stood there for half a day, this pair of master and disciple still didn't open their golden mouths, but chatted there by themselves, as if they didn't see her as a person at all.
<br><br>"Disciple ah, you are now grown up, there are some things, it is also time for you to understand." Yi Feng lowered his voice and said.
<br><br>Then from the ring of space, took out two thick books and quietly pushed them towards Zhong Qing.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing shot his gaze towards the two books.
<br><br>"Golden Pin Mei."
<br><br>"The Monk of the Lamps and Grasses."
<br><br>The titles of the two books were reflected in the eyes, making Zhong Qing feel strange, and the book help was also crumpled, and the bottom corners of the pages had been rolled up.
<br><br>It can be seen that the usual Yi Feng did not turn over a lot.
<br><br>"You open it and see, this is your master adapted, some of the knowledge in it can let you benefit a lot." Yi Feng said quietly, the voice was lowered. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Remember, watch quietly."
<br><br>Yi Feng this appearance, immediately let Zhong Qing on the two books full of curiosity, quietly turned a page to see, the eyes suddenly a stare.
<br><br>The chrysanthemum/flower also fiercely tightened.
<br><br>"Master!"
<br><br>"Deeply hidden ah!"
<br><br>He exclaimed.
<br><br>"Shhh!"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly made a hand gesture.
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded, and with wild eyes, he put the two books away.
<br><br>"By the way, also, do you plan to have children nowadays?" Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"Children?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his head and laughed heatedly, "Isn't it a little too early for you to say this, Master, I'm still a child myself."
<br><br>"Then since you do not want children, then you some measures are essential ah!" Yi Feng explained bitterly.
<br><br>"Ah?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing frowned and said, "Please also tell me master, I really do not understand ah!"
<br><br>"Let me tell you this, there are many kinds of measures." Yi Feng towards Zhong Qing science: "And the most effective measures ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng scratched his head.
<br><br>This world, I'm afraid there is really no such thing.
<br><br>In that case, Yi Feng came up with another trick and said, "Then you have to learn to count her safety period."
<br><br>"Safe period?"
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"Then this, how exactly should be calculated?"
<br><br>"This well ......"
<br><br>Not far away, watching this master and disciple two people more and more chatting, the woman in black face hard to see the extreme.
<br><br>Is she so not into the eyes of the two?
<br><br>Even a glance will not?
<br><br>Because of the two mortals, with her identity to painstakingly disguised as such, is already unprecedented.
<br><br>She originally wanted to retain the last trace of dignity, so that the master and disciple themselves invited her over, so that she could also control the initiative.
<br><br>But now this situation, does she have to personally come over?
<br><br>She gritted her teeth.
<br><br>After all, she could not, she forced a faint smile and walked towards the master and disciple at the window.
<br><br>"Hello, guys."
<br><br>The woman in black shouted softly, her voice extraordinarily nice.
<br><br>The sudden voice made the master and disciple who were chatting about their business startle with a jolt, only then did they realize that a woman came next to them.
<br><br>"Ahem."
<br><br>Yi Feng straightened his clothes, coughed lightly to cover the matter they were chatting about, and asked with a straight face, "Hello, may I ask the girl, is there something wrong?"
<br><br>"Here's the thing, I'm a little tired from all the traveling today, I wanted to eat at the store, but there are no extra seats in the store, I think you two are elegant, so you must not be bad people, so can you let me sit here?"
<br><br>The black-clothed woman's voice came out leisurely, and her language carried a magic that people could not resist.
<br><br>And her words are also very clever.
<br><br>First, she expressed her plight, and then had a compliment to the two people, and finally showed her reason.
<br><br>Not deliberate and not pretentious.
<br><br>She just couldn't believe that there was anyone else in this world who would refuse.
<br><br>And she also thought well, after sitting down, it is inevitable that conversation will occur, and then get acquainted with each other, it is best to be invited by Yi Feng to travel with him again, and finally explore whether Zhong Qing is a divine body ......
<br><br>All this.
<br><br>Smoothly into the chapter.
<br><br>No surprise, all will be realized as expected according to her wishes ......
<br><br>"So is it convenient?"
<br><br>Thinking of this, she added a sentence and looked at Yi Feng leisurely.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng rejected her directly.
<br><br>"Sorry, it's not convenient."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled apologetically.
<br><br>"Uh, huh?"
<br><br>The woman in black didn't slow down for a moment and was frozen on the spot.
<br><br>With her qualifications, it's just as well that you didn't take the initiative to invite her, yet she sent herself to the door, and you still refused.
<br><br>"Why ...... why?"
<br><br>She couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"No reason, just inconvenient, sorry."
<br><br>Yi Feng said apologetically.
<br><br>It's really not that he is petty, after all, this thing he encountered last time in the desolate pathless there, if it is the usual time, but any individual issued this kind of request, he will not refuse.
<br><br>But now, it's really not the right time.
<br><br>After all, they are talking about such topics, you a woman to come over what is the matter?
<br><br>This is really inconvenient ah!
