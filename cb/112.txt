But just as she was surprised, a strong sense of crisis came.
<br><br>Then it was discovered that there was a burst of movement from a different direction ahead.
<br><br>Obviously, it was the pursuers coming.
<br><br>She immediately frowned, beautiful eyes looked at the cliff behind her, red lips tightly bitten, reluctantly jumped down.
<br><br>......
<br><br>"This shitty place, finally came out."
<br><br>Yi Feng carried the Wangba in his hand and walked lazily.
<br><br>Obviously the temperature in the mountain is not high, but under this rush, the body has long been hung with sweat stains.
<br><br>"Hey, there's a waterhole here."
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up, went over and tested the water temperature, found that it was not cold, immediately stripped off his clothes and jumped into the water naked.
<br><br>"Comfortable ah!" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng washed his body clean, the palms of his feet stepped on the water, the upper half of his body exposed to the water just waist high, facing the daylight coming through the forest, revealing a pleasant smile.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>At this time, a shadow suddenly smashed down from above, raising several feet high water splashes.
<br><br>The water splashed on Yi Feng's face, so that he could not see the situation clearly, and when the water subsided to look again, but found nothing.
<br><br>"What the hell?"
<br><br>Yi Feng still treading water, observing, even to the water completely restored calm, but also did not find anything.
<br><br>"Guess a rock fell down, right?"
<br><br>He thought so.
<br><br>But the next moment, he found something swimming up under his legs.
<br><br>"It can't be a snake, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked terrified!
<br><br>The next moment, he had a jolt.
<br><br>This thing seems to attack his lower plate ah, Yi Feng panicked and wanted to step back, suddenly in front of his waist directly, a head emerged.
<br><br>Her face, just through the surface of the water, revealing a pair of large eyes, staring at himself.
<br><br>It seemed.
<br><br>It was a female?
<br><br>Yi Feng also looked down at this face close to the ground, and was suddenly confused.
<br><br>For a while, the two stared at each other with wide eyes.
<br><br>"Bastard!"
<br><br>Suddenly, the water surface penetrated a jade hand, a slap on Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>"My grass."
<br><br>Received a slap Yi Feng immediately confused, without saying a slap back in the past, while the mouth cursed: "You fucking scared me a big jump, but also hit me a slap?"
<br><br>This slap also immediately dumbfounded the woman.
<br><br>Cold as frost pretty face immediately shrouded on a dense killing intent, a long sword appeared in the hand, wet body broke the water, a sword towards Yi Feng stabbed over.
<br><br>But to mid-air she just stored power, but found that the body power is not enough, a stagger and smashed down from mid-air, landed on top of Yi Feng's head.
<br><br>"Holy shit!"
<br><br>With a roar from Yi Feng, both of them entered the water.
<br><br>......
<br><br>The fresh breeze drifted in, the forest leaves danced.
<br><br>It is nearly dusk, the fire light leisurely, I do not know whether it is the illumination of the fire or the evening sun, the sky is red and brilliant, very nice.
<br><br>The woman opened her eyes leisurely, the cold body in the warmth of the firelight, seems to be somewhat better.
<br><br>Then, a young man in green clothes, carrying a kingpin in his left hand and a bamboo basket on his back came towards her.
<br><br>She furrowed her pretty eyebrows and looked surprised.
<br><br>"It's you?"
<br><br>She just recognized that this youth, wasn't it the mortal she had met in the mountain?
<br><br>"Yes, it's me." Yi Feng hung the wangbao on the tree, put down the bamboo basket, and said in no good mood, "Do you know, you really scared me to death just now!"
<br><br>At that, the woman's face was as cold as frost.
<br><br>I did not expect that she had not yet started, this youth actually took the lead to find her trouble.
<br><br>However, she is not a person who does not know what to do, at first, although the momentary anger, but in retrospect, it really does not blame Yi Feng, of course, remembering the incident just now the water pool, her face still can not help but look ugly.
<br><br>That scene, it is difficult to say!
<br><br>Especially this mortal actually also slapped her, is really ......
<br><br>But looking at the clothes covering her body, and the youth who did not have the slightest intention of misbehaving, she still held back the anger in her heart.
<br><br>"Come on, fish, tonic body."
<br><br>Yi Feng handed over the roasted fish in his hand.
<br><br>The woman frowned and said in a cold voice, "You know I'm a martial cultivator."
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave her a white look and said, "Still want to eat?"
<br><br>The woman frowned her pretty eyebrows, resumed her expressionless color and said, "This kind of stuff, it's of no use to me."
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes opened, stood up and said, "The fish is useless to you, then you Ya ...... will not be thinking about my Wang Biao, right?"
<br><br>Said Yi Feng, full of reluctance.
<br><br>"This head of the old Wang Ba although it is a great tonic, but this is what I want to bring to my family's little Zhong Qing to eat."
<br><br>At these words, the woman's face immediately shrugged down, a little bit crying and laughing at this mortal in front of her, she hall martial king cultivator, will think about a king's ears?
<br><br>It's ridiculous!
<br><br>Looking at the heartless Yi Feng, the woman who did not care to speak could not help but ask: "You are a mortal, coming into this mountain range, you are not afraid?"
<br><br>"What is there to be afraid of?"
<br><br>Yi Feng spat out a fish spine and asked in disbelief.
<br><br>The woman's voice stalled.
<br><br>Forget it, mortal thinking always has limitations, many things simply will not understand, and he said simply to the ox, but looking at the clothes covered, she said after a slight hesitation: "You eat hurry up and think of a way to get down the mountain."
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted his head.
<br><br>"Because if you don't go down the mountain, you will die."
<br><br>The woman said with a solemn face, and without waiting for Yi Feng to ask, she continued, "In this mountain, there is a great event that you mortals cannot imagine."
<br><br>Saying that, she slightly raised her head.
<br><br>In his mind, couldn't help but float the memories that came from the soul search from the little demon's memory.
