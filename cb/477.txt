That's it.
<br><br>Su Yunyun was distracted for the rest of the night, so she walked out of the martial arts school to have a cup of morning tea and calm down a bit.
<br><br>But just as she arrived at the entrance of the martial arts school, she was stunned.
<br><br>With her red lips slightly open, her mood, which had only calmed down after a night, was once again in turmoil.
<br><br>Because she suddenly discovered that the beef stall she frequented these days, the owner and the owner's wife were actually not mortals.
<br><br>Despite hiding it well, she could see at a glance that these two were at least Heavenly Immortal level immortals.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>How could there be so many immortals?
<br><br>She was full of incredulity, if we add the old man who was herding cattle that she met when she entered the city, it was equivalent to saying that this Pingjiang City possessed three immortals besides Yi Feng and Bone Ben Wei?
<br><br>"Boss, have a bowl of beef noodles."
<br><br>At this time, on the beef stall, came an old man who was holding a cane. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>As soon as this old man appeared, Su Yunyun's pupils shrank again.
<br><br>She actually found that this old man was also an immortal.
<br><br>"Pork Rong ah, save half a catty of five-flowered meat for me later, and pick some ribs for me by the way." After the old man sat down, he shouted towards the meat stall on the side.
<br><br>"Okay no problem."
<br><br>The big man selling pork picked up the ribs with his hand and knife.
<br><br>Su Yunyun's eyes widened again.
<br><br>This big man selling pork seemed to be another immortal!
<br><br>Even the pig-killing knife he was holding to chop the meat was an immortal weapon.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The pork rong right now was not the last immortal she had seen.
<br><br>To be precise, she stood at the entrance of the martial arts school, and any person her eyes reached seemed to be permeated with extraordinary.
<br><br>For example, under the tree across the street because of a move to regret chess, two old men arguing with each other ......
<br><br>diagonally opposite the vegetable stall, the two people haggling over the price of a pile of tofu ......
<br><br>Or, not far from the street corner, two sleeves rolled up, because of an egg and pointing at each other cursing a woman ......
<br><br>All of these people are, without exception, immortal-level existences.
<br><br>Even.
<br><br>A rat that crawled past the sewer at the street entrance seems to be on par with her current strength?
<br><br>Su Yunyun was already too surprised to say anything.
<br><br>Inside this city.
<br><br>There couldn't be.
<br><br>Couldn't be a per capita immortal, right?
<br><br>She crossed the street entrance with a face full of apprehension and came to another street.
<br><br>Hiss.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>A whole street of immortals.
<br><br>She hurriedly ran back to the martial arts school and closed the door, breathing sharply while hastily calming herself.
<br><br>Couldn't help but feel emotion.
<br><br>What kind of a place had she come to!
<br><br>This small town that seemed to be filled with the atmosphere of the city actually possessed so many experts.
<br><br>What was even more terrifying was that within these immortals, there were actually hidden the kind of experts that she could see were extraordinary, but could not tell the exact strength.
<br><br>What does this mean?
<br><br>It means that the existing strength of those people is not lower than her cultivation in her previous life.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>Originally just want to drink a morning tea, the results of the morning tea did not drink, the whole person drank confused.
<br><br>Knock knock!
<br><br>Just at this moment, there was a knock on the door from outside.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun asked alertly.
<br><br>"Me."
<br><br>Outside the door, Yi Feng's voice came out.
<br><br>"It's him?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun's body trembled.
<br><br>Her face was steeply tense, and she was also a little afraid to face Yi Feng.
<br><br>Clenching her shellfish teeth, she hesitated for a long time before opening the door with an apprehensive mind.
<br><br>Doorway.
<br><br>Yi Feng stepped on his flying sword and stood there.
<br><br>Seeing the door open, he flew in on the flying sword.
<br><br>And seeing this flying sword again, Su Yun Yun Yun's breath caught in her throat.
<br><br>Because of the restored cultivation, she only completely saw the extraordinary flying sword.
<br><br>But it could only see the unearthly, could not see its specific quality at all.
<br><br>This means.
<br><br>The flying sword under Yi Feng's feet was definitely an existence that surpassed the level of a top-level immortal weapon.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Existence beyond the level of immortal weapons, that is a divine weapon level.
<br><br>Divine weapon.
<br><br>This was something that even she, who possessed the Nine Revolutions Divine King Body, did not dare to imagine.
<br><br>Thinking back to her previous judgment of this flying sword, she could not wait to find a crack in the ground.
<br><br>"How's the rest." Yi Feng put away the flying sword and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"I'm fine, much, much thanks senior."
<br><br>At this moment when she saw Yi Feng again, Su Yun Yun Yun completely changed her attitude.
<br><br>Because she knew it by heart.
<br><br>Even in her heyday, she did not have the capital to be proud in front of this person.
<br><br>"En, since we are well rested, let's talk about business!" Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"Please also ask senior to speak straightforwardly."
<br><br>Su Yunyun asked nervously.
<br><br>"Join the Heaven and Earth Sect and become my disciple at the same time." Yi Feng said straightforwardly.
<br><br>"Become your disciple?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun's eyes widened and she made a dumbfounded sound.
<br><br>"Not willing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>How could this work.
<br><br>After such a long delay, he had to succeed in fooling, immediately, he said in a serious manner, "As long as you join my disciples, you will never regret it, I will make you a true pride of heaven and turn into a god-like existence."
<br><br>Anyway, blowing than lulling well.
<br><br>Yi Feng is not afraid to say the big.
<br><br>First fucking lulled to say.
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng slightly angled his head, pretending to look like a high person, quietly waiting for Su Yun Yun Yun.
<br><br>"Become a god-like existence."
<br><br>"Doesn't this mean that it will enable me to directly become a god?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun's heart was greatly shocked.
<br><br>She herself was convinced by all the means she possessed in Yi Feng's martial school, let alone Yi Feng's direct promise to let her become a god.
<br><br>"Disciple, pay my respects to Master!"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun instantly knelt down.
<br><br>A sincere voice came out.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Yi Feng emitted a satisfied voice.
<br><br>It seems that one's fooling around was still effective.
<br><br>Today it was obvious to see that this girl's attitude towards him had changed.
<br><br>Also at this time, a familiar voice came from the system.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host for accepting an apprentice."
<br><br>"Progress in accepting apprentices: 5/100."
<br><br>"To celebrate the first disciple received by the host after creating the sect, several items are awarded."
