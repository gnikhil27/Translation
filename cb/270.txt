"Martial spirit?"
<br><br>The crowd glanced at each other and then agreed, "Yes, yes, it's so scary."
<br><br>"Yeah, it's really scary!"
<br><br>After saying that, the crowd couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>"Not only that yet, in addition to this Martial Spirit, there are also quite a few Martial Masters and Grand Martial Masters such as the middle strength, in short, this Ye family is still very powerful and terrifying." Yi Feng said again towards the crowd, because since others were willing to help him, he also had to tell everyone about the level of danger this time.
<br><br>"Yes, yes."
<br><br>"Then it seems that this Ye family is really terrifying."
<br><br>The crowd echoed one after another.
<br><br>In their hearts, they couldn't help but think that this big brother's state of mind was really back to the basics, simply completely treating himself as a mortal ah.
<br><br>"So ha all of you, if you don't want to get involved if you feel dangerous, everyone can withdraw, I won't blame you." Yi Feng added: "Just need everyone to help me keep a secret."
<br><br>"No quit no quit." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, if I can help Mr., even if I have to go through fire, I will not hesitate to do so."
<br><br>The people said in a hurry.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng a ringing finger.
<br><br>In place.
<br><br>This group of fans is really fucking on point.
<br><br>"In that case, then let's discuss this time's action." While saying that, Yi Feng closed the doors and windows tightly.
<br><br>Just like this.
<br><br>The several major powers of the Southern Sand Patriarch and Sect Master, the Holy Maiden and Young Master, plus a few Martial Emperors and Martial Saints, got together in this small room and plotted how they could snatch the marriage under the noses of the Martial Spirit experts.
<br><br>"Gentlemen, the biggest change that may occur in our operation this time is that Martial Spirit!"
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng said solemnly, "So against this Martial Spirit, we must have a plan to deal with it."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng turned his gaze to Yang Tianyu and the others and asked, "So, I would like to ask you guys, do you have the ability or the means to also invite an expert like the Martial Spirit to help?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The people looked at each other and scratched their heads.
<br><br>For a time, they were in a dilemma.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>Can we get it?
<br><br>Unable to help, they looked at Yi Feng and asked cautiously, "Then sir, then are we, can we or can't we?"
<br><br>"Why are you asking me, ask yourselves, don't you yourselves know better than me?" Yi Feng asked speechlessly.
<br><br>"Then in that case, then we can of ...... right?"
<br><br>After saying that, the crowd turned their nervous gazes towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Great, that's great."
<br><br>Yi Feng slapped his thigh.
<br><br>Sure enough, he really guessed well ah.
<br><br>This group of people who were engaged in art really had some heritage, so a master like Wu Ling, who sounded awesome, could really be invited.
<br><br>No wonder, no wonder Peng Ying was caught by them before.
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>It seemed that this time, there was no wrong speculation about Yi Feng's meaning.
<br><br>"Good, gentlemen, then please, invite this Martial Spirit expert over as soon as possible." Yi Feng hurriedly said, "Of course, we'll just let this expert press the battlefield, and try not to have this kind of expert strike until the moment of last resort."
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng also thought that it was quite difficult to invite such an expert.
<br><br>"Sir, I will go and contact this expert."
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu bowed his head respectfully and then walked out of the room.
<br><br>After walking out of the room, Xue Qinzhu took out the voice transmission jade slip and ordered, "Immediately send a Martial Spirit from the clan."
<br><br>After receiving an echo there, Xue Qinzhu then reentered the room.
<br><br>"Sir, the matter has been done, that Martial Spirit expert will soon come over." Xue Qinzhu hurriedly said.
<br><br>"It's simply fantastic."
<br><br>Yi Feng emitted an excited voice, but of course, he was not completely on top because of the addition of the martial spirit.
<br><br>Because he understood that with the joining of this martial spirit expert, it was only a solution to their worries, the matter of robbing the bride, it must be something that must be planned properly.
<br><br>"Pork Rong, tomorrow your task is ......"
<br><br>"And Grand Master Wang, your task is ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng one by one ordered the tasks of the people, and then looked at Bone Ben Wei, said, "And you, you run fast, ghostly and smart, you are responsible for going to the palanquin, you hear."
<br><br>"And the last apprentice you will go to the designated place to meet, and when the wife arrives, rack the horse and run!"
<br><br>"That sir we?"
<br><br>Xue Qinzhu and others asked.
<br><br>"Your words, need to stay with me, if forced to fight, I'm afraid you need to help." Yi Feng said: "Of course, do not need you guys to really fight with them, just need you guys to hold back to hold back."
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>All of them answered.
<br><br>"Good, the whole plan is perfect."
<br><br>Yi Feng clapped his hands, and finally solemnly reminded: "But everyone, finally I still want to remind everyone a sentence ah, we are mortals, and cultivators hard to fight is unable to fight, when the time must be calm, only wise, not strong attack, can not fight, try not to fight, everyone understand."
<br><br>"Understood."
<br><br>The people have answered.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng then revealed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>Now, all things are ready, only the east wind, as long as the martial spirit expert arrived, at any time can make a move.
