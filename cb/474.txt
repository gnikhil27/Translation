In the nirvana state without cultivation.
<br><br>Even if Su Yun Yun was an immortal emperor in her previous life and possessed many means, it was impossible to outrun three immortals.
<br><br>Two breaths later, Su Yun Yun Yun was caught up.
<br><br>"Haha, Su Yun Yun Yun, let's see where you're going to run!"
<br><br>The three instantly surrounded Su Yun Yun, and an icy cold voice came out.
<br><br>"Star compass, no wonder!"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun looked at the compass in the old man's hand with dead eyes, her eyebrows filled with gloom, because with this star compass in place, as long as her breath was locked, then she would be caught up by the three people even if she ran to the ends of the earth.
<br><br>"What to do."
<br><br>Su Yunyun slender jade hand clenched, sharp nails deadly pinch the flesh inside, biting the red lips look full of reluctance.
<br><br>Wanted her to easily revive a life, thought she could re-approach the peak and get back what belongs to her, but did not expect to be approached by the enemy so soon.
<br><br>Could it be. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Is it really going to fall!
<br><br>She hated.
<br><br>Hate God's injustice.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when she thought she was bound to die, a black-robed man suddenly descended from the sky and landed in front of her in the dark night that strolled with a faint mist.
<br><br>"Is that him?"
<br><br>"It's that mortal dwarf?"
<br><br>"How did he appear here?"
<br><br>As soon as this familiar back appeared, Su Yun Yunyun's eyes snapped wide and an unbelievable voice came out.
<br><br>"You three trash, want to kill someone, have you gone through this scum's consent?"
<br><br>The black-robed man raised his head and crossed his back, questioning in a deep voice.
<br><br>"What are you?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei's appearance without warning immediately caused the three old men to narrow their eyes, and a questioning voice came out.
<br><br>"Jagged man, Bone Ben Wei."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crossed his arms and said.
<br><br>"No matter what you are, we do things you better get out of the way, do not draw fire." After sizing up Bone Ben Wei, one of the old men said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Get out of the way?"
<br><br>"You don't even ask if this scumbag agrees?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said without the slightest fear.
<br><br>But Bone Ben Wei's words moved Su Yun Yun's heart behind her, full of shame.
<br><br>She never thought that at the time of her desperate crisis, it was this dwarf, who disgusted her, who stopped her despite the danger.
<br><br>It could not be helped.
<br><br>In her heart.
<br><br>This odd dwarf seemed to become great.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>The odd man out is odd, but he has the courage of heaven to help himself to stop the danger.
<br><br>Just a second thought.
<br><br>What's the point of having courage?
<br><br>How could he, a guy who didn't even know a Martial Emperor, stop the three great immortals, which was undoubtedly seeking death.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Knowing that she was bound to die, she did not want to involve Bones Ben Wei, so she hurriedly shouted, "You hurry up and leave me alone, or you will die."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>No sooner had she said that than she received a scolding from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"You shut up, you stinking dead pussy!"
<br><br>"You say you stay well in the martial arts school is not good, these three loaches can still do what you do not? You run run run, run nima it, but also run out of Pingjiang City."
<br><br>"You really think this scum wants to help you, is playing high, if not the master's command, this scum does not care whether you live or die."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei cursed in anger.
<br><br>The last bit of family money, it was easy to call a young lady, is ready to spend the night together, and ran into this thing, simply angry he almost got bone cancer.
<br><br>The head of the cursing sound.
<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you are getting into.
<br><br>
<br><br>This skeleton Ben Wei, who had little strength, actually dared to scold her?
<br><br>Only, she had no time to pursue the matter before she saw the three old men suddenly make their move, transforming into three lightning bolts and attacking towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Be careful."
<br><br>Although she knew that it was impossible for Bone Ben Wei to dodge the three men's attack, she still subconsciously shouted out.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>No sooner had her voice fallen than her eyes widened violently.
<br><br>The scene that suddenly happened in front of her eyes made her directly petrified in place.
<br><br>Just now.
<br><br>What did she just see?
<br><br>She had just actually seen this dwarf extend a finger from his black robe and flicked the three major immortals under Chen Yi Zhen's command away instantly.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>Flew.
<br><br>Rather, it was the kind of flying where the body exploded.
<br><br>After landing on the ground, those three seemed to be without any semblance of breath, dead.
<br><br>This unexpected turn of events was like an explosive thunder that boomed in her mind.
<br><br>How could it be?
<br><br>How could it be!
<br><br>A mistake, an illusion?
<br><br>She desperately rubbed her eyes, afraid that she saw wrong.
<br><br>But the facts before her eyes told her that what just happened was not a dream, this dwarf had really killed the three immortals in seconds with one finger.
<br><br>The horror in her heart made her unable to slow down for a long time.
<br><br>The pair of wide-eyed eyes looked at Bone Ben Wei dead for a long time, full of incredulity.
<br><br>However, Bone Ben Wei withdrew his finger and glared back at her, drinking, "What is there to see, why don't you hurry up and get back to the martial school for this scum?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun's face was ugly.
<br><br>But not caring about Bone Ben Wei's scolding, she only wanted to understand why Bone Ben Wei had such strong strength.
<br><br>Who the hell was he again?
<br><br>How could he be so powerful?
<br><br>So powerful that she felt that even in her former life in her heyday, she was not a match for him.
<br><br>Only, before she could make a sound, suddenly there was a person with only half of his body left shakily climbing up.
<br><br>"Unexpectedly ah Su Yunyun, you still have such an expert by your side."
<br><br>"But you don't rejoice too early, this dwarf is still strong enough to withstand the wrath of Immortal Emperor Yi Zhen, I have already transmitted what happened here back to Immortal Emperor Yi Zhen, you won't be able to escape, hahaha ......"
<br><br>That half of the body, emitted a crazy laughter.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Hearing this, Su Yunyun, who had just escaped from the tiger's mouth, was filled with gloom.
<br><br>Yi Zhen's tactics she knew all too well.
<br><br>If it was really as he said, then she was afraid that she would have endless troubles next.
<br><br>"Yo?"
<br><br>"To withstand a billionth of my power and not die, quite a bull you!"
<br><br>At this point, the voice came from Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"But you force nima it force force."
<br><br>Bad mood extra grumpy skeleton Ben Wei, directly and a finger down.
<br><br>This finger.
<br><br>Let him far in another world of the nine clans, are exterminated cleanly.
<br><br>Even the ancestral graves of the family's eighteen generations of ancestors, also collectively exploded.
