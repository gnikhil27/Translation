Signed Wu would want his head to explode and couldn't figure out why this was the case.
<br><br>You should know that Wolong Fu is one of the great lords of the Heaven's Immortal Palace, although he is not good at fighting, but is known for his power and strategy.
<br><br>But no matter what, it is also one of the hegemons of the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>This can be seen from the fact that the Gathering Treasure House is all over the Immortal Realm and no one dares to move, his energy and strength.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yet, he knelt down in front of this black-robed man?
<br><br>Only then did Wu Sign realize that he had far underestimated the strength of this black-robed man in front of him.
<br><br>"What, Luo Lao, what about Luo Lao?"
<br><br>"You quickly think of a way, I do not want to die ah!"
<br><br>Looking at the skeleton Ben Wei step by step approaching, Wu sign tears and snot are anxious out, the only palm of the hand panic grasping Luo Lao's clothes, emitting anxious voice.
<br><br>But Wolong Fu are kneeling, Luo Lao he can have what can be done, cold sweat under, also simply do not know how to do. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>The black robe came to the front of the two.
<br><br>Body in their eyes magnified, just like a god of death standing there.
<br><br>Two people moved on the ground struggling backwards.
<br><br>At this time, among the black robe, a bone palm gently probed out, gently pointing.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>With an explosive sound, Wu Sign's only remaining palm exploded.
<br><br>There were continuous screams.
<br><br>And Wu Zheng, who had lost both hands and feet, was now completely like a cicada chrysalis, staring with fearful eyes as he struggled and squirmed on the ground.
<br><br>"Humph, I warn you to stop!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Luo Lao summoned up the courage to threaten, "We are from the Heaven's Immortal Hall, the young master is the son of the Heaven's Immortal Hall's Great Emperor Wu Fan, if you don't stop, Great Emperor Wu Fan will not let you go."
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Under the black robe.
<br><br>A faint voice came out.
<br><br>A gentle squeeze of the palm of his hand.
<br><br>The Luo Lao in front of him, directly turned into nothingness.
<br><br>"Ah, ah ah ......"
<br><br>See suddenly turned into nothingness Luo Lao, Wu sign throat is like clicked fish spines, panic gasping, struggling cicada chrysalis-like body, desperately wriggling.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei face expressionless.
<br><br>The palm of his hand lifted.
<br><br>White finger bones once again, the horror to make people's scalps numb energy, towards the Wu sign slowly enveloped the past.
<br><br>Wu signed widened his eyes.
<br><br>The eyes were filled with despair.
<br><br>"Stop!"
<br><br>Just at that moment.
<br><br>Above the dome of the sky.
<br><br>A majestic voice came from it.
<br><br>Then a human figure came out of the sky tearing through the space.
<br><br>His black hair was draped behind his head, carrying the majesty and aura of a superior.
<br><br>As soon as he stepped out, the whole heaven and earth seemed to have changed, and the whole space was filled with an oppressive aura.
<br><br>Those who were slightly weaker in strength actually prostrated themselves to the ground.
<br><br>"Wu Fan?"
<br><br>Seeing the situation, Wolong Fu, who was kneeling on the ground and couldn't move, a surprised voice came out.
<br><br>And when Wu Sign, who was preparing to wait for death, saw this, he suddenly cried with excitement.
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>"It's father."
<br><br>"It's father coming."
<br><br>"That's right, father put a seal on me long ago, as long as my life is in danger, he will be able to sense it."
<br><br>"Hahahaha, my father has arrived, with my father around, I'll see who dares to kill me."
<br><br>"All those who harm me will be executed by my father."
<br><br>Wu Fan's arrival.
<br><br>It gave Wu Sign a complete bottom, lying on the ground with his mouth open and laughing madly.
<br><br>Mid-air.
<br><br>Looking at Wu Sign's limbs all gone, Wu Fan's killing intent surged.
<br><br>Glancing again at Wolong Foo who was kneeling on the ground, he coldly snorted, "Wolong Foo, you are becoming more and more incompetent."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Wolong Fu's face was suffocatingly ugly.
<br><br>Wu Fan didn't pay any more attention to Wolong Fu, but turned his harsh gaze towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>There were no second words.
<br><br>Raising his hand.
<br><br>It was a palm that covered down towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>With the fall of this palm, the entire range of levels, hard sunk hundreds of feet, turning into a sinkhole.
<br><br>And in addition to the treasure pavilion protected by the formation, the surrounding houses were crushed to powder.
<br><br>Although the treasure pavilion is protected by a formation, but it does not prevent the damage caused by this palm to the skeleton Ben Wei.
<br><br>It came directly towards Bone Ben Wei locked.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"Father has struck."
<br><br>"You're dead."
<br><br>Wu Sign lay on the ground laughing hideously.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>His laughter came to an abrupt halt.
<br><br>Both pupils stared at the sky in horror, engorged and dilated, covered in blood.
<br><br>This was because he saw Bone Ben Wei flick his finger and directly broke his father's palm, and then the power of the palm print dissipated into thin air.
<br><br>This directly struck Wu Sign badly enough.
<br><br>"How can this be, how can this be?"
<br><br>"Isn't father invincible, how could he not be able to beat this dwarf!"
<br><br>Wu Sign shivered and shouted, filled with disbelief.
<br><br>Wu Fan himself was also stunned, standing in mid-air and coughing violently.
<br><br>Because this finger had not only broken his palm, but also caused him to suffer a backlash.
<br><br>But he didn't stop, his palms stepped on the void and shrunk into a ruler to lock towards Bone Ben Wei again.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei stood there without the slightest move, quietly waiting.
<br><br>Wu Fan was getting closer and closer.
<br><br>But I thought he was going to attack Bone Ben Wei, but a dodge came next to the Wu sign, and grabbed the Wu sign with one hand.
<br><br>At the same time, a talisman that shone with golden light was taken out by him.
<br><br>"Farewell for today, today's revenge will be avenged in the future!"
<br><br>Wu Fan's voice came out coldly, and the golden talisman in his hand shone brightly, then father and son disappeared.
<br><br>"Father, where are we going!"
<br><br>In the spatial passage, Wu Sign shouted.
<br><br>"Back to the Immortal Hall of Heaven!"
<br><br>Wu Fan responded with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"The Heaven's Immortal Hall?"
<br><br>Wu Sign's eyes lit up when he heard this, and he immediately laughed out loud, "As long as we return to the Heaven's Immortal Hall, this person cannot help me even if he has heavenly means."
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Wu Fan nodded his head with a sullen face.
<br><br>A few breaths later, the two directly passed through the teleportation and entered the barrier of the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>After entering the Heaven's Immortal Hall, Wu Fan's gloomy face only slightly improved.
<br><br>He had never expected that this black-robed man would be so terrifying.
<br><br>Even just now he strongly felt that if he didn't pull the scroll to teleport away as soon as possible, he would have to be accounted for there as well.
<br><br>But the good thing is.
<br><br>Now it has arrived at the Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>Even if this person's methods are heavenly, they can't help them father and son.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>He just breathed a sigh of relief, his face suddenly changed.
<br><br>Then it was seen, the clouds rolled, the void broke open.
<br><br>A fleshless palm, directly out of the void, directly towards his father and son.
<br><br>"No one can save the person this god wants to kill!"
<br><br>"What's more, no one can stop it."
