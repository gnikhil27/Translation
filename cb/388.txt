Then he saw that the three great demons of the Golden Immortal level, who had just been so aggressive, fell to the ground with their eyes staring, becoming three dead bodies.
<br><br>Ow!
<br><br>The six green-clothed men covered their mouths and almost shrieked, trembling with fear.
<br><br>This is a Golden Immortal level demonic beast ah, just like this and die?
<br><br>Even if the fact happened right in front of them, the six people still felt incredible.
<br><br>But until a group of old men came to the backyard, boiled up the water, plucked up the hair, and then into the pot, the fragrant smell came out, the six people finally believe the facts in front of them.
<br><br>That Golden Immortal level great demon, really dead.
<br><br>"No, we can't just sit here and wait for death."
<br><br>At this moment, a voice came from a man in green and said in a firm voice, "The appearance of this group of people is already enough of a threat to Lord Duan's plan."
<br><br>"That's a good point."
<br><br>Another person also nodded solemnly: "If it was just a group of Martial Emperors and Earth Immortals, it wouldn't be enough to make Lord Tuan afraid, and it wouldn't have much effect on Lord Tuan, then it doesn't matter if we die here, but even Golden Immortal level demonic beasts are used to eat ......" 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"It means that the strength of this group of people is much more than that simple, so we can't wait to die, we must find a way to convey the information here."
<br><br>"It seems that we can only use this."
<br><br>The green-robed man at the head of the group raised his arm and said leisurely.
<br><br>One could see that on the back of his hand, a bizarre pattern was being drawn.
<br><br>"Fortunately before the trip Lord Tuan gifted us this, although Lord Tuan solemnly instructed that using it will consume Lord Tuan's power, without special circumstances even death is not allowed to use it, but now that we are carrying such information, I believe that Lord Tuan will not reprimand us if we activate it."
<br><br>"Good, but we need a little time to recover some cultivation first before we can activate it."
<br><br>"Then let's not just sit there, let's hurry up and recover our cultivation at the same time as we heal our wounds."
<br><br>The six green-clothed people discussed and after making up their minds, they closed their eyes and entered the state of healing and recovery.
<br><br>The three big pots of fragrant wild game cooked by Yi Feng himself were brought to the table.
<br><br>The eyes of the people present lit up.
<br><br>One after another, they understood that the real big chance had finally come.
<br><br>"Oooh, delicious, it's so delicious."
<br><br>"This meat contains so much power inside, I feel like I'm about to break through."
<br><br>"I feel like I'm about to break through too."
<br><br>The game down, the group of recently arrived bricklayers, eating hot tears, have emitted excited voices.
<br><br>"You people don't grab, don't grab, calm down, gradually you will get used to it." Those resident residents of Pingjiang City, on the other hand, were calm and calm, and a cautionary voice came towards these new arrivals.
<br><br>"Don't say, the taste is really fresh."
<br><br>Yi Feng himself also ate wolf, after all, the time now is not early, the fight plus get the three beasts out, now unknowingly is already to evening.
<br><br>"Sir."
<br><br>"It's still raining outside, and it's almost dark. The president specially instructed us to prepare good guest rooms in the restaurant to stay with you and others."
<br><br>"At the same time, we also invited the opera troupe for the evening, as well as the flower girl of the Wind and Rain House, Mor Sihan."
<br><br>At this time, the steward came to Yi Feng's side again and said softly.
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>"The Wind and Rain House's Mor Sihan, she is very famous in Pingjiang City, your president is really too polite!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>"What did you say, sir, this is all as it should be." The steward said with a smile, "Sir, you guys eat and drink well first, I'll go and get busy first, tell me whenever you need something."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng politely nodded his head.
<br><br>After the steward left, he said loudly towards the crowd, "Listen up, we have invited the opera troupe and the flower girl from the Wind and Rain House to help us in the evening, everyone eat and drink slowly, we will continue in the evening."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>Lively voices came out.
<br><br>For a while, the restaurant was filled with laughter, each of these Martial Emperor Human Immortals transformed into a marketplace, paddling and sparring with wine, the atmosphere was a lively one.
<br><br>A little later ......
<br><br>With a slight commotion as well as a fragrant breeze, the crowd scrambled to look towards the door.
<br><br>Surrounded by two delicate girls, a woman in red came with an umbrella.
<br><br>Her skin is like snow, her eyes are like a water, entering the door looking at the time, with a sense of elegance and gentleness, but the delicate attitude between the hands and feet, but also seductive!
<br><br>Looking around, the soulful eyes fell on Yi Feng.
<br><br>Qian Qian's body bowed.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>"I think the girl is the flower leader of the wind and rain building, Miss Mor Sihan?"
<br><br>"Indeed, being known is better than seeing!"
<br><br>Even with Yi Feng's state of mind, he could not help but subconsciously stroke his collar when he saw this woman and nodded his head gently.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Flower Fairy, it's the Eastern Victory Flower Fairy Mor Sihan!"
<br><br>"Yes, how did she appear here?"
<br><br>However, seeing Mor Si Han, many of the movers in the field were stunned, they were originally from the major powers of Eastern Victory, so they knew this name like a thunderbolt.
<br><br>It is rumored that this woman came from the Jedi Valley, strong strength to lead the Jedi Valley to the top of the East Victory not to mention that she herself is also a favorite of the heavens, born with unchanging face, beautiful posture does not age.
<br><br>"Legend has it that she has long since passed away?"
<br><br>"Yes, and her strength was a Martial Emperor a thousand years ago, how could she appear here as a flower girl now?"
<br><br>"Hiss, it's just too incredible."
<br><br>The crowd was talking about it.
<br><br>But remembering that before, they had also seen many legendary figures appear inside this city, it seemed that Mor Sihan's appearance was not surprising.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>A woman who was cooking on the island was trembling and could hardly calm down.
<br><br>The moment she saw Mor Sihan, she even almost knelt down.
<br><br>She was the current patriarch of the Absolute Valley, but in terms of seniority, the Mor Sihan in front of her was considered her ancestor!
<br><br>The beautiful eyes of Mor Sihan lightly glanced at her, which made the woman did not lose her temper in the first place, before the excitement in her heart was suppressed.
<br><br>"First, a toast to sir."
<br><br>Mor Si Han came to Yi Feng, Qian Qian jade hand after pouring two cups of wine, then first lift the cup to cover the sleeve to drink, the action light and elegant.
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted his cup and raised it, and also drank it in one go.
<br><br>"Sihan will play a song for you and all of you next, I'll make a fool of myself!"
<br><br>The beautiful eyes flashed, the long jade hand was already on the strings.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, smiling and waiting.
<br><br>But in his heart, he did not think so.
<br><br>Not to look down on this woman, it is really the level of music in this world is not good, how he can not appreciate.
<br><br>So the person is good-looking he admitted, but the song he really did not hold much hope.
<br><br>The strings of the piano fluctuate.
<br><br>The melodious zither sound finally came out ......
<br><br>The sound of the zither into the ears and come, self-conscious drinking Yi Feng, just raised the glass of wine in mid-air suddenly a meal, fiercely will look at the Strange Si Han.
<br><br>He damn.
<br><br>Zhou Dong's nocturne?
