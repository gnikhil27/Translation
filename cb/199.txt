"What do you mean?"
<br><br>"This tomb you just can't go!"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave him a white look and lectured, "Even though there has been a danger once, can you be sure that there is no more danger?"
<br><br>"Sir you mean that there is still danger inside this tomb?" The old man of Green Mountain asked.
<br><br>"Otherwise, anyway, you will be cold if you go!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said solemnly.
<br><br>Although he also bad to say what other dangers, but Lu Qingshan so an old bone, even if the head smashed down a stone, I'm afraid to hiccup.
<br><br>He really can not figure out, this old man is quite good, is a little lack of brain.
<br><br>Such a big movement of a tomb, he has half a foot in the soil of the dead old man, has always remembered, really drunk.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, so that the old man of Castle Peak face a white.
<br><br>Especially the sentence must be cool, but also scared him out of a cold sweat. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>See Lu Qingshan dazed, Yi Feng afraid that the old man still can not think, so reminded: "old man, you do not think, even if there is really no danger inside, you can not go over to reap the benefits, has long been shortcut first."
<br><br>"Can not reap the benefits of being short-changed?" Lu Qingshan exclaimed again: "Sir, what do you mean?"
<br><br>"That's what it means, what else does it mean?"
<br><br>Yi Feng rolled his eyes.
<br><br>This is originally, this kind of tomb, not to mention the old bones like the old ancestor of Qingshan, cultivators do not know how many have gone, you an old man running is not as fast as others, can not grab and can not fight, there are good things are not others first?
<br><br>"I understand, thank you sir for reminding."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan nodded respectfully towards Yi Feng, and after accompanying him for a couple of drinks, he hurriedly rushed back to the Qingshan Sect.
<br><br>Just as he returned, Yun Xian Que arrived with two old men with profound auras.
<br><br>"Elder Lu, let me introduce you, these two are Elders Yang Mu and Yang Sen of my Wind and Cloud Valley." Yun Xian Que introduced.
<br><br>"Greetings to the two elders."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan nodded in greeting, looking at the aura on the two men, they should be the two Martial Dignitaries who had arrived as Yun Xian Que had said.
<br><br>The two people looked at Lu Qingshan and were slightly surprised to see that it was the half-zun realm, but they did not ignore it too much and nodded likewise.
<br><br>After several people sat down, Yun Xian Que opened the door and said, "Lu Lao, how are you thinking about it, as long as you cooperate with my Feng Yun Valley, two Martial Dignitaries plus you a half Dignitary, it is not difficult to pocket those treasures."
<br><br>At those words, Lu Qingshan fell silent.
<br><br>In his mind, echoing Yi Feng's words, he let out an emotion before saying, "Miss Yun, forgive me for not being able to promise you."
<br><br>The two Martial Exalted powerhouses frowned.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que also had an incredulous look on her face, she did not expect that Lu Qingshan was still unwilling to make an alliance.
<br><br>However, having learned a lesson from the last time, she did not directly turn her back, but spoke up and asked, "Elder Lu, can you tell us the reason?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan took a deep breath, lifted his head and said, "Indeed, I am also very excited about this treasure, but it is not enough to make me give this life."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's red lips opened slightly and she exclaimed, "You mean, in this tomb?"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan picked up, "There is still a big danger in this tomb."
<br><br>At the same time, Lu Qingshan remembered Yi Feng's words, "It will be cold," and added, "If I guessed correctly, the next danger should be even more terrifying than the last one!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was stagnant.
<br><br>The last danger almost made their three sects' great martial experts fail to come out, if it was an even more terrifying danger, wouldn't that mean that even if the martial experts went, they wouldn't necessarily be able to survive?
<br><br>"Another prophecy from that one?" Yun Xian Que asked solemnly.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>"Hmph, a bunch of nonsense."
<br><br>However, Yang Mu emitted a disdainful voice and said in a deep voice, "What prophecy or not, although last time was an accident, but this time it was two Martial Dignitaries, could it still not take a tiny tomb?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que also turned his gaze towards Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>Apparently, he was also asking, "Are two martial experts really not enough?
<br><br>Seeing this, the old ancestor of Qingshan shook his head and sighed: "Enough is another story, in fact, even if there is no danger, it is useless for us to go."
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"Because ......"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's pupils shrank and said solemnly, "The things in that tomb have already been short-changed."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que fiercely stood up in shock, his mouth murmured, "How is this possible?"
<br><br>"Humph, alarmist talk!"
<br><br>However, Yang Mu on the side directly refuted: "Been short-changed, lying you also do not play a draft, now that the tomb organs are opened, before the organs are exhausted, no one has the ability to go into that tomb, because even if the martial dweller goes in only to die, but you say that things were short-changed, simply a nonsense."
<br><br>"Well, since the good intentions as a donkey's liver and lungs, then I have nothing to say!"
<br><br>At these words, Lu Qingshan also had some anger on his face, and stood up to leave.
<br><br>When he passed by Yun Xian Que, he gave a slight beat to his feet and said in a deep voice: "Miss Yun, I hope you can remember the previous lesson, for the sake of the relationship between my two clans, I have said what I can say, believe it or not, it is up to you."
<br><br>Said, Lu Qingshan directly away.
<br><br>"Humph, if you don't want to alliance, you don't want to alliance, and also make up this kind of excuse with big words."
<br><br>Seeing Lu Qingshan leave, Yang Mu two martial dwellers sounded disdainful and said, "Miss, we don't need to care about Lu Qingshan, when the time comes, the three of us can go, with the two of us in will definitely protect you from worry, the holy relics will also be in the bag."
<br><br>However, Yun Xian Que made a voice that surprised them.
<br><br>"No, we won't go." Yun Xian Que said.
<br><br>The two Martial Dignitaries were shocked and quickly said, "Miss, you're not really listening to that Lu Qingshan's alarmist words, are you? These are three holy relics!"
<br><br>"He is not an alarmist!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que took a deep breath and said solemnly.
<br><br>Because the lesson from last time was too heavy, if not for Uncle Lin saving her at the critical moment, she, Yun Xian Que, would have become the dead soul in that tomb.
<br><br>Repeating the same mistake, she will not do it again.
<br><br>"Miss you, how can you listen to a bunch of nonsense from Lu Qingshan, these are three holy items, do you just give them away for nothing?" Yang Mu said with an angry face, "Since you don't want to go, Miss, then the two of us will go."
<br><br>"No, you guys can't go." Yun Xian Que hurriedly said.
<br><br>"Then I'm afraid you can't stop us, Miss." Yang Mu said nonchalantly, "After all, your father has given a deadly order to bring back at least one holy object."
<br><br>"Good, if you go, then I will die in front of you."
<br><br>Suddenly, a flash of cold aura appeared, Yun Xian Que put a green blade against his neck, gritted his teeth and said, "Two elders, you believe me, I really do it for your own good, you are all my relatives, I don't want to see what happened to Lin Bo, if my father's side blames down, I will talk to him clearly."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"You silly ah!"
<br><br>Yang Mu two people sighed heavily, full of reluctance.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's character they could not be clearer, now they could stop Yun Xian Que from messing up, but they could not keep watch at all times, in case something really happened, it would be even worse to explain.
