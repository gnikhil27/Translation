"Hm."
<br><br>"Not just mortals?"
<br><br>"You eyeless thing!"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing said in a deep voice: "You'd better shut your mouth, don't not know how to die when the time comes."
<br><br>After saying that, Desolate Wu Jie angrily flung his robe sleeves and was about to leave.
<br><br>But the long-skirted woman saw Desolate Wuji this appearance, but is more interested, quickly stop Desolate Wuji curiously asked; "Desolate Wuji, know you for so many years, I really have not seen you this look, today I will give you the words here, if you do not tell me what this youth is in the end, I will not leave."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Desolate pathless looked at the long-skirted beautiful woman, her face filled with sulking anger.
<br><br>But then she knew the woman's character, which turned back and grunted angrily: "I can tell you, but you'd better not say anything, you know, then give me a quick departure."
<br><br>"Hey you hurry up and say, don't sell it."
<br><br>Long-skirted beauty woman appetite was whetted, and hurriedly asked. First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Desolate pathless glanced at the courtyard alone drinking Yi Feng, took a deep breath, then solemnly said: "This although you can not see through his cultivation, but is absolutely super terrifying existence, even I suspect that he is not a Martial Emperor at all!"
<br><br>"Not a Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>The long-skirted beautiful woman was slightly surprised and said incredulously, "Could it be that he could still be an immortal in the sky?"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji nodded solemnly.
<br><br>"But, hasn't the path to immortality been cut off, nowadays in this Immortal River Continent, where does an immortal come from?" The long-skirted beauty asked in confusion.
<br><br>"This, who can say for sure, but I feel that he is an immortal!"
<br><br>Desolate Wu Dao's words were full of certainty.
<br><br>Because if he wasn't an immortal, there was no way to explain the means that Yi Feng's carving would be able to kill Firewalker and the others.
<br><br>At least, Desolate Wuji thought that this kind of means, even the Ten Life Martial Emperor could not do it.
<br><br>Not even talking about Yi Feng, just from Yun Lang's mouth description, Bone Ben Wei's means of single-handedly capturing Shui Xing back, likewise surpassed the ability of what Ten Life Martial Emperors could do.
<br><br>"All right, I've told you all that needs to be said, you guys leave quickly, don't disturb us two brothers drinking and cause him displeasure."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Brothers?"
<br><br>But the long-skirted beautiful woman caught the key word and questioned out.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing hesitated slightly, then nodded solemnly and said, "Yes, brother!"
<br><br>"Hahahahahaha ......"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The long-skirted beautiful woman laughed out loud.
<br><br>"What are you laughing at?" Desolation Wuji asked with a sullen face.
<br><br>"I'm laughing at when you, Desolate Wujing, became so naive."
<br><br>The long-skirted woman cackled, "Originally you said he was an eight or nine life Martial Emperor, with your Desolate Wuji's attitude towards him, I could still believe eight or nine points, but you insisted that he was some kind of Immortal, and said he was a brother with you, don't you think it makes people laugh off, where would an Immortal be a brother with a two life Martial Emperor like you?"
<br><br>"Humph, forget it if you don't believe me."
<br><br>Desolate Wujian turned red and shouted angrily.
<br><br>"I also did not say that I must not believe, you do this, take us two and the immortal brother you said to get acquainted, it is always okay, right?" Long-skirted beautiful woman said.
<br><br>"You're thinking pretty well." Desolate Pathless said with a gloomy face, "I don't care whether you believe it or not, I don't need you to believe it either, you hurry up and leave me quickly!"
<br><br>"The more you want me to leave, the more I will not leave." The long-skirted woman raised the corner of her mouth and said, "I still want to meet this immortal brother of yours today."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing could not rest in anger.
<br><br>"Desolate Trail, why do you have to be so angry, you do not care whether we believe it or not, back a million steps, even if you say this is really immortal, to introduce us to know is not too much, right?" The long-skirted woman added: "After all, three people can be more considerate than you alone, right?"
<br><br>Desolate Pathless frowned.
<br><br>This woman's words were not without reason.
<br><br>Of course, the more critical thing is that he knows the character of this woman, if you do not let her have her way she really does not see to go.
<br><br>Rather than let her uncontrolled here, it is better to agree to her.
<br><br>"OK, but I'll ask, he agreed to do so."
<br><br>Desolate Pathless said in a deep voice, then walked back towards the inner courtyard.
<br><br>"Older brother, I have two old friends who know you're here and want to come over to meet you as well, see ......" Desolate Wu Jie asked.
<br><br>"Oh, that's really polite, quickly let them in!" Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Smiling, Desolate Wuji then walked back to the outer courtyard.
<br><br>"How was it?"
<br><br>The long-skirted beauty asked.
<br><br>"That brother of mine promised you guys to meet him, but before meeting, there are some things I must say to you guys beforehand."
<br><br>Desolate Pathless explained in a deep voice.
<br><br>"First, when you arrive in front of him, you must not be rude."
<br><br>"Second, he is hiding his identity, and I am also pretending to be a mortal in front of him, although he knows all this, but you must not break it, understand, or do not blame me Desolate Wujing turn my face away."
<br><br>"Okay, no problem."
<br><br>The long-skirted beauty promised.
<br><br>"You guys go ahead, I won't go."
<br><br>And at that moment, the old man in gray, who had never spoken, refused with an expressionless face, clearly not interested in any of these things.
<br><br>"You old man, what else is there to raise your interest all day long except your broken chessboard?" The long-skirted beauty said in an unpleasant manner.
<br><br>The old man in gray remained expressionless.
<br><br>"Go, we must go today." The long-skirted beauty said firmly.
<br><br>"Yes, since I have agreed with that brother, let's go together, there is no harm in it." On the side, Desolate Wuji also persuaded.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Only then did the gray-clothed old man nod in silence.
<br><br>Finally, Desolate Wujing led the two into the inner courtyard and arrived at the table.
<br><br>The gray-clothed old man still had the same expressionless look, as if whether Yi Feng was an immortal or not had nothing to do with him.
<br><br>However, the long-skirted beautiful woman raised the corners of her mouth.
<br><br>She would like to take a good look at this immortal brother of Desolate Pathless, how much weight he has.
