"Ye Bei, you are despicable!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan cursed.
<br><br>"This, old brother you can't blame on my head." Ye Bei was busy raising his palm and said with a solemn face, "I really have the conscience of heaven and earth, they are together, all because of love!"
<br><br>"Master uncle, we are indeed because of love ......"
<br><br>"You shut up."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan drank angrily, under the extreme anger, above the forehead are blue veins raging.
<br><br>Zhu Yun lowered his head and did not dare to speak.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ye Bei busy said: "Aiya old brother, although this thing is quite sudden, but rather tear down a temple not a marriage well, our two doors become in-laws, is also a great thing ah!"
<br><br>"Right uncle, I also think so, although there was a small friction before, but the bombing gang to make amends for the sincerity of our entire Castle Peak Sect have seen, turn dry grievances into silk, to a kiss on top of a kiss, is not better." Zhu Yun also muttered on the side, "Not only me, several disciples and elders of our Castle Peak Sect have also found their in-laws it ......"
<br><br>"What do you know?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Green Mountain drank loudly, his gloomy gaze fixed straight on Ye Bei. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>It feels like his entire Castle Peak Sect has fallen under Ye Bei's sugar-coated shells, leaving his old ancestor alone to struggle to hold on?
<br><br>This Ye Bei, really good tactics ah!
<br><br>But at this moment, although he is the old ancestor, but there is nothing he can do, Zhu Yun he can hit the lovebirds, but others?
<br><br>Now the hearts of the entire Castle Peak Sect are inclined to the Explosive Sky Gang, his old ancestor if the destruction, I am afraid that not only will not convince the public, but also a bad reputation.
<br><br>So, can only plant their heads, black face and sigh.
<br><br>This ship of thieves, he is determined to get on!
<br><br>"Cough cough, old brother, has been so, don't sulk, since you can't stop things, we might as well go along with accept, you say?" Ye Bei smilingly came over and raised his eyebrows towards the Old Man of Qingshan, while waving his palm, Little Zuo Xiaoyu came over again and rubbed himself against the Old Man of Qingshan.
<br><br>The old man was a little bit of a fool.
<br><br>The old man of Qingshan could only admit it.
<br><br>Since he could not change, he could only passively accept it, and was teased by the two women, the old ancestor said with a black face: "We'll talk about it afterwards, I need to close down for a day."
<br><br>As he got up, he said toward the two women: "You two, help me to protect the law."
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>He then took the two women far away and left.
<br><br>Martial Hall.
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned as he was decocting medicine for Zhong Qing, who had awakened last time, but not long after, he was back in a coma.
<br><br>"It seems that we really need to go to the mountains to pick some more medicine!"
<br><br>Yi Feng poured the medicine and sighed, it's not that he didn't think of sending Zhong Qing to a medical center for treatment, but he still trusted himself more, after all, he was trained by the system in this area.
<br><br>Thinking of the urgency of the situation, Yi Feng did not dare to delay, so he called a car to send Zhong Qing to the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, and then entrusted it to them.
<br><br>Then he reentered the martial arts school, carrying a small bamboo basket, and prepared to go up to the Shogun Mountain once more.
<br><br>But before he left, he looked at the acoustic guitar resting in the corner that was already covered with cobwebs, remembering the scarcity of this medicine and not knowing how long it would take to return, he took this acoustic guitar with him.
<br><br>The sound effect is very general.
<br><br>Is Yi Feng used to guard the store when bored to do.
<br><br>Previously will sit at the front door to ride the dusk girl more time, talk about the damn few songs, but also harvested a few small fan girls, although ugly, but at least it is considered a fan of people.
<br><br>Later, in order to make a living, Yi Feng gradually put such a hobby on hold.
<br><br>And this time on the mountain, time is long, especially at night, can only bring this thing to pass the time.
<br><br>Rush days are always dull and boring, but after two days, Yi Feng has also arrived at the foot of the Shogun Mountain.
<br><br>Of course, Yi Feng was not aimlessly searching, he had a good idea of these medicinal herbs and understood which places would probably appear what herbs.
<br><br>"Heavenly Heart Tantra, I'm afraid this is only available within the Grand Canyon, but where the sunlight is sufficient and the air is good."
<br><br>Yi Feng held in his hand the map he bought from the city, looked at one of the directions and rushed towards there.
