"You think you're a bully just because you're posing for a move?"
<br><br>Just like that, one slash after another ......
<br><br>Several black-clothed men did not even cast out their skills, they were effortlessly hacked over by Yi Feng to the ground, leaving only the leader of the man fell to the ground, dying.
<br><br>Such a scene, has long looked silly next to the master and servant two, the two red lips open big, full of surprise.
<br><br>From the aura that was revealed, it could be seen that these seven people were all Martial Emperors.
<br><br>However, such seven Martial Emperors, in front of this young man, there is no half resistance, a few knives were killed.
<br><br>The point is, they have not been able to see clearly until now, what cultivation level this youth is!
<br><br>"You are not robbing me, continue to rob ah you trash!"
<br><br>Yi Feng put the kitchen knife on the neck of the leader of the man, coldly shouted.
<br><br>"I, I was wrong, spare me, spare me, please spare me."
<br><br>"Oooooo ...... I shouldn't have robbed you." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Feeling the cold light on the kitchen knife, the head man prostrated on his knees, emitting a remorseful voice.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"I thought how bullish you are, just now you are not quite dragging?"
<br><br>Yi Feng coldly snorted, his gaze could not help but glance disdainfully toward the side.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It is Yi Feng this sudden glance and walk away, the head man eyes flashed a hideous cold light, suddenly from the ground stormed up.
<br><br>And at the same time, the body Yuan Qi in his body surge, towards the right hand convergence.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>A stupid ball of energy coalesced in his hand, sweeping a rolling storm.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, you're still too young."
<br><br>"Just now you should have just killed me, since you didn't kill me in the first place, then suffer my deathbed recoil!"
<br><br>A crazy voice came out from his mouth, revealing a desperate look, and thrusting the powerful attack in his hand, towards Yi Feng's chest.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Be careful."
<br><br>Seeing this, the two master and servant who were watching the battle at the side immediately stared with frightened beautiful eyes and anxiously transmitted a reminder shout towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>They never expected that as a Martial Emperor expert, he was actually so insidious and cunning, kneeling down and begging for mercy on the surface, and then taking advantage of people's unpreparedness to launch a sneak attack behind the scenes.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>All of this, it was already too late!
<br><br>From the time the man in black coalesced his attack, to the time he pushed Yi Feng's chest, the process actually happened only in a split second.
<br><br>This palm with a strong ball of energy has landed directly on Yi Feng's chest.
<br><br>This blow, hit!
<br><br>"He, is dead?"
<br><br>The two master and servant watching the battle saw that Yi Feng had been hit by the palm, their hearts thumped, their beautiful eyes staring deadly at Yi Feng, their hearts guessing apprehensively.
<br><br>Although they were shocked by Yi Feng's strength before, but so close and defenseless to withstand the Martial Emperor's blow, in their opinion is also a bad luck.
<br><br>The black-clothed man who attacked, also held his breath and looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>The hawk-like eyes, a motionless.
<br><br>"Dead?"
<br><br>He also had the same apprehensive guess in his heart.
<br><br>Wind.
<br><br>Whistling and passing.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The field was deathly silent, even the breathing of the crowd was silenced.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>A voice broke all this calm.
<br><br>"You touch me?"
<br><br>The voice came out from Yi Feng's mouth, while his palm rubbed his chest.
<br><br>"Before dying to touch me, good damn a dying backlash, the damage is not too insulting enough ah!"
<br><br>Lifted the palm of his hand a big mouth smacked in the face of the man in black, smacked him over on the ground, the palm of his foot on his chest.
<br><br>This scene, originally let the heart are to the throat of the master and servant two, directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>Touch, touch you?
<br><br>Martial Emperor's blow, actually described as touch you ......
<br><br>This word sounds, how so indebted to it.
<br><br>The black-clothed man who was stepped on the ground was even more dumbfounded, staring at Yi Feng with a pair of bloodshot eyes, staring at him dead.
<br><br>The defenseless bear his strongest blow, but actually half a thing?
<br><br>"You, who the hell are you?"
<br><br>The man in black's eyes dripped with unwillingness and fear as he asked word by word.
<br><br>"What kind of person do you think I am?"
<br><br>Yi Feng sneered.
<br><br>The man looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"I am your grandfather."
<br><br>Yi Feng dropped a chopper, cleanly.
<br><br>Up to this point.
<br><br>All seven men in black lost their lives.
<br><br>"Really, what people dare to stop and rob these days, really think I am a vegetarian."
<br><br>Yi Feng pulled up the clothes of the men in black, while cursing and spitting, while wiping the blood on the chopper clean and put away.
<br><br>After putting away the chopper, Yi Feng straightened his spotless robe and looked over at the two women with a faint smile.
<br><br>"The two girls don't need to worry about it."
<br><br>He said gently.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the two master and servant shivered and hurriedly warily walked over and bent down next to Yi Feng, respectfully and incomparably shouted, "Greetings to senior."
<br><br>"Eh, what seniors or not seniors, is not to take out a few trash." Yi Feng hurriedly picked up the two women and said unconcernedly.
<br><br>The two women's mouths couldn't help but twitch.
<br><br>The martial emperor a mouthful of trash, this is really let them do not know what to say.
<br><br>But there was no way to refute it.
<br><br>After all, people are right, seven Martial Emperors just cut and chopped down, in the eyes of others, I'm afraid the Martial Emperor is really trash!
<br><br>"Instead, I have to thank you guys too."
<br><br>Yi Feng then added, after all, these two sisters goose is goose, but that help him the kindness or see.
<br><br>"Seniors are too polite, seniors do not need our help at all, but we have become a burden to seniors." The two women said apprehensively.
<br><br>"You two are too polite."
<br><br>Although the two women are indeed right, but Yi Feng also do not want to blow them this road to see the injustice plucked to help the good behavior, so quite with a joking words comfort: "The two of you come, is to give me courage it, after all, in front of the beauty, I can burst out this flood of power ah."
<br><br>Yi Feng's joking words made the nervous two women couldn't help but cover their mouths with a smile.
<br><br>I can't imagine that this high person is actually so funny and humorous.
<br><br>And looking at his spotless and courteous appearance, it seems difficult to associate him with the terrifying figure who just made seven Martial Emperors become dead under his sword!
<br><br>Both sides, again, exchanged pleasantries for a while.
<br><br>I learned that this woman's name is Ye Yi, next to her little maid Xiaochun.
<br><br>"By the way, is there a city ahead?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"In reply to senior, there is an official pond city just a few dozen miles ahead." Ye Yi respectfully replied.
<br><br>"It's good that there is a city."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and nodded, while adding, "Miss Ye, no need to call me senior or anything, just a mortal, there is no need to engage in that set of immortal cultivators."
<br><br>"Mortal ...... mortal?"
<br><br>Ye Yi opened her red lips wide and looked at Yi Feng incredulously.
<br><br>"I still lie to you can not, you see me like a person with cultivation?" Yi Feng spread out his hands and laughed.
<br><br>Ye Yi huffed her mouth.
<br><br>Right.
<br><br>Mortal.
<br><br>The surface looked indeed mortal, at first she really believed it.
<br><br>But after witnessing Yi Feng kill seven Martial Emperors, she could only say that she had never seen such a mortal in her life.
<br><br>So Ye Yi couldn't help but laugh: "Senior is really joking, if senior is really a mortal, how could he solve those seven people so easily."
<br><br>"What can't this be solved?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, "They were originally crooked, and it's not that only cultivators can fight seven in one, mortals can do it too."
<br><br>"Senior is joking again, how can a mortal fight seven of them." Ye Yi laughed, in her heart she only thought that Yi Feng was making fun of her.
<br><br>Wait.
<br><br>But just after finishing.
<br><br>She seemed to have noticed something was wrong.
<br><br>What Yi Feng said just now was that even a mortal was able to beat seven in one?
<br><br>What did he mean?
<br><br>Ye Yi suddenly remembered that when Yi Feng killed these seven people just now, he did not reveal any breath at all, nor did he perform any cultivator's means, and his moves were exactly the same kind of stance used by mortals.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Once recalled to this, Ye Yi jerked back a breath of cold air.
<br><br>That is to say.
<br><br>This one in front of me, just using mortal means, killed seven Martial Emperors?
