Wu Tian Empire mourned the whole country.
<br><br>And at this time, the world of extermination, has also rushed back to the Genting Empire among.
<br><br>Exterminating the world personally, naturally, there will be no surprises.
<br><br>The Genting king revealed a cold smile.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"Daring to go against us, this is the downfall."
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch and Extinction walked towards the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>"Once this Wu Tian who caused us to lose our Qi luck dies, I think it should bring back the lost Qi luck!" The Genting Kingdom Monarch said.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Perdition nodded. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Because according to the reasoning.
<br><br>Pulling together can add qi luck, becoming an enemy will cut qi luck, then this person no longer exists, qi luck should be no increase or decrease, restore to the original state.
<br><br>"Wait a little longer, the matter of qi change is delayed from time to time." Perishable said indifferently.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler nodded his head.
<br><br>Then the two of them sat down next to the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, one on the left and one on the right.
<br><br>They also waited for the change of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>As expected.
<br><br>Half a day later, fluctuations came from the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>The two people opened their eyes at the same time, and their expressions immediately brightened.
<br><br>The Qi Luck Immortal Pillar was always glowing with a leisurely light under the foreshadowing.
<br><br>As time slowly passed, the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar finally began to formally change.
<br><br>Under the excited gaze of the two, the qi luck finally increased to the state it was in when it had not yet touched Wu Tian.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two breathed a sigh of relief at the same time.
<br><br>"It's finally restored."
<br><br>Perdition raised the corners of his mouth and smiled.
<br><br>"Yes, it's not easy!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch likewise revealed a smile.
<br><br>Although the efforts targeted at Wu Tian during this period of time were in vain, it was not unacceptable for them to make up for the lost Qi luck now.
<br><br>As long as there was no loss, it was only a matter of time before they wanted the consummation of the Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>"Wu Tian this matter is over, hurry up and follow the Messenger Heavenly Book instructions to complete the next task!" Destruction said, "We have already delayed too much lately, if we continue to delay, the messenger and the Lord are afraid that they will be dissatisfied with us."
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>The Genting king nodded solemnly, and with a movement of his palm, he was about to take out the Guidance Heavenly Book.
<br><br>But just as he got it halfway, he noticed something and hurriedly turned his head towards the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar next to him.
<br><br>To his horror, he found.
<br><br>The Qi Yun Immortal Pillar, which had just calmed down, actually started up again with a foreshadowing.
<br><br>And Perdition likewise discovered this scene and asked in horror, "What's going on, how come the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar has started up again as an aura?"
<br><br>Both of them looked at each other, both of them were confused.
<br><br>Under the two people's doubts, the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar aura fluctuation was getting bigger and bigger.
<br><br>"Something is not going to happen, right?"
<br><br>A bad premonition appeared in the heart of the exterminator.
<br><br>The pupils of the Genting kingdom also moved, things that can cause changes in the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar are not trivial and cannot be allowed to be the slightest bit sloppy.
<br><br>So he hurriedly said, "I'll quickly send someone to check and see if there is any change regarding the qi luck."
<br><br>Having said that.
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler hurriedly conveyed the order down.
<br><br>After the order was conveyed down, the two hearts were apprehensive as they sat down next to the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>The two people did not dare to close their eyes until they found out what had caused the change in the Immortal Pillar of Qi Luck.
<br><br>The two of them waited.
<br><br>It was two hours.
<br><br>And the precursor fluctuations of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar also lasted for two hours.
<br><br>Finally, the subordinates sent out had rushed back.
<br><br>"Report to the king, all matters concerning qi luck, no change."
<br><br>"The entire territory of Genting has not detected any hidden problems either."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler hurriedly got up and solemnly asked, "Confirmation?"
<br><br>"Your Majesty, it's absolutely true."
<br><br>The subordinate respectfully answered.
<br><br>"Go down!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler waved his hand and finally breathed a sigh of relief, turned towards the exterminator and said, "Since there is no hidden danger, I think we don't need to worry too much, on the contrary, it is likely to be good."
<br><br>"Wow?"
<br><br>Exterminating the world's gaze moved, flooded with expectation.
<br><br>"This qi luck, also not only artificially will change."
<br><br>"For example, within my country, the emergence of a hidden mysterious realm, or the unearthing of the cave of those senior immortals, or the birth of a gifted generation, will all cause a change in qi luck." The Genting ruler explained, "Just now I made all the agencies check the whole country, since there is no hidden danger, then the change of the immortal pillar of qi luck is in all probability caused by the reason I just mentioned."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Perishable eyes also instantly lit up.
<br><br>If this is really the case.
<br><br>It's really a blessing in the snow.
<br><br>And looking at the precursors of this Immortal Pillar of Qi Luck, I'm afraid that the changes that will occur later are not just a star and a half.
<br><br>Then their big plan to complete the immortal pillar of qi luck is right in front of them.
<br><br>The two people look happy, full of expectation waiting for the arrival of the formal change of the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>After an hour had passed, the aura fluctuation finally passed.
<br><br>"It's coming."
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler drank.
<br><br>Perdition nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Both of them also clenched their fists at this moment.
<br><br>They even had already thought in their hearts that after the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar was completed, the Lord's supreme reward would descend.
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>The Qi Luck Immortal Pillar, however, brushed off the original basis, directly lowered by half.
<br><br>This sudden stroke directly made the Cloud Top king hold his heart and jerked straight over, falling straight to the ground.
<br><br>Extinction was also like a pillar stunned in place.
<br><br>Directly dumbfounded.
<br><br>And at the same time, the Wu Tian Empire just buried the imperial tomb, suddenly exploded.
<br><br>Then a human figure with towering hair rose to the sky.
<br><br>"I, Wu Tian!"
<br><br>"Back again!"
