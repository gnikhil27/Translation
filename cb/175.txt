After having these new tasks, the next days, Yi Feng is completely busy.
<br><br>While practicing calligraphy, while getting some gadgets carved, after all, carving this thing is still a blank, OCD he always felt uncomfortable, always a little progress.
<br><br>Of course, this aspect of cooking he is also not idle.
<br><br>It can be said that this skill is what he finds most useful, after all, he also has to open his mouth to eat, after the mission opened, Yi Feng feels that he cooked more delicious.
<br><br>But remember to change types frequently to promote fast, so Yi Feng is no longer limited to cooking, such as some famous food in his previous life, he also wants to get out.
<br><br>And the first snack that he wanted to make was the god-tier snack that swept the world.
<br><br>Chili fries!
<br><br>This thing in the previous life is a best-selling existence, and even circulated a saying, there is nothing that a packet of spicy strips can not solve, if there really is, then two packets.
<br><br>After crossing over for so long, Yi Feng still has a fondness for this flavorful food in the previous life.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>More importantly yes, he grew up in the hometown of spicy sticks before crossing over, the birthplace of spicy sticks. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>What a coincidence, also called Pingjiang!
<br><br>As a person who grew up here, so he is familiar with how to make spicy strips.
<br><br>When the first spicy strips were stirred out by hand in the pot, Yi Feng wiped the sweat on the top of his head and showed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>"Doggie, taste it!"
<br><br>Yi Feng grabbed a few sticks and threw them towards the dog.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>The dog rushed over and ate all the spicy strips in a few bites, and then his eyes opened wide.
<br><br>These few spicy strips in his mouth made his realm, which had just entered Demon Dignity, not yet completely solid, actually solid?
<br><br>Not only that, he found that the spicy strips also had the effect of briefly boosting his strength, these few sticks down, he found that he was able to briefly spar with the middle Demon Dignity power.
<br><br>Seeing the dog reveal that look of excitement, Yi Feng also hurriedly tasted one.
<br><br>Cow pie.
<br><br>Tasty.
<br><br>The taste of home.
<br><br>Awesome.
<br><br>"Excuse me, is anyone there?"
<br><br>Just then, a questioning voice came from outside.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng put down the spicy fries in his hand and walked towards the outside.
<br><br>Stepping outside, he found an old man with a mouth full of yellow teeth looking around.
<br><br>"You are?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was just about to ask a question when Ao Qing suddenly rushed out, his gaze winked at the old man, while transmitting a voice: "Uncle Yun, hurry up, this is not a place for you to come, I will come to you outside the city later."
<br><br>Seeing this, that old man quickly understood and said towards Yi Feng, "Sorry, I found the wrong place."
<br><br>After saying that, he quickly left.
<br><br>Yi Feng gave him a puzzled look, then returned to the martial arts school and started practicing calligraphy again.
<br><br>The dog came up, bowed his head towards Yi Feng and barked twice.
<br><br>"Go on by yourself!"
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and gave him a white look, just want to take a shit, usually this dog solves it by himself, this time still want him to sneak around?
<br><br>At that word, the dog rushed out of the martial arts school.
<br><br>The reason why you need to ask for Yi Feng's consent is because he understands that the relationship between Yun Bo and him is certainly well known to the master.
<br><br>But the master sense of life, certainly will not point out.
<br><br>When he arrived outside the city, Uncle Yun, who had been waiting for a long time, welcomed him.
<br><br>"Third prince."
<br><br>While speaking, there were tears in his eyes.
<br><br>"Uncle Yun, what brings you here?"
<br><br>Ao Qing said softly, for this Yun Bo he does have special feelings, since childhood he is the only one who did not look down on himself, has been close to him.
<br><br>"Something happened to the tribe."
<br><br>Yun Bo worried, and then what happened in the tribe, said once again.
<br><br>However, Ao Qing did not fluctuate.
<br><br>"Third prince, there is at least your home!" Uncle Yun said with a serious tone.
<br><br>"Uncle Yun stop, that's not my home, this martial arts school is!" Ao Qing said, "Whatever the reason, that old man knew I was falsely accused and expelled me from the tribe, causing me to almost die outside, I have no more feelings for there!"
<br><br>"You, imperial son, how can you say that, after you put Ao Qingcheng that, the wolf emperor has long been impressed with you ah." Yun Bo said softly, "Besides, what's so good about you staying in this broken martial school, huh?"
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>However, as soon as Yun Bo's words fell, Ao Qing, who had just been close to Yun Bo, changed his aura and suddenly burst out with a strong killing intent.
<br><br>"I warn you, if you dare to say one more bad word about the martial school, you will die!"
<br><br>Ao Qing said with a hoarse grin, the aura of a demon wolf, leaking out in full at this moment.
<br><br>Yun Bo was scared and was forced to the corner, trembling and shaking as he looked at Ao Qing, but what was more shocking was Ao Qing's cultivation, stammering and shouting, "Your Majesty, I, I was wrong, I was talking too much, it's just that you you, your cultivation ......"
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Qing only put away the killing intent on his body and said flatly: "Demon Zun but, it's no big deal!"
<br><br>"Demon daddy?"
<br><br>"And so?"
<br><br>Yun Bo immediately drew back a breath of cold air, shivering and said, "Third prince, you say this, is it too ...... uh, floating a little too much?"
<br><br>"Heh!"
<br><br>Ao Qing snorted a laugh.
<br><br>Because of following Yi Feng's side, he didn't know at what time, his state of mind had also changed greatly.
<br><br>In the past, the demon daddy was indeed a heaven-like existence in his eyes.
<br><br>But now ......
<br><br>Demon Zun.
<br><br>It really is nothing.
<br><br>To say that truly powerful, it is also his master and skull brother like.
<br><br>Looking at Yun Bo's unbelievable appearance, Ao Qing said the existence of Yi Feng and Skull Brother in awe, and said that he had the strength of a demon in a short period of time because of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yun Bo was stunned by Ao Qing's words and once again could not speak.
<br><br>He also did not expect that the one he just saw at the door was actually such a powerful existence.
<br><br>After the shock, there was a strong excitement.
<br><br>"No wonder Elder Jin said that you are the savior of the Imperial Clan lineage, so son, quickly follow me back to the tribe, as long as you strike, that Red Sun lineage will collapse!" Yun Lao said expectantly.
<br><br>"I said, I will not go back!"
<br><br>Ao Qing said indifferently.
<br><br>"You, gongzi."
<br><br>"It's your home after all, there's your father, your friends, and your mother ......" Uncle Yun said heartily.
<br><br>Ao Qing's face has not changed much, until talking about his mother, he only slightly moved.
<br><br>"Go back, I am not going back."
<br><br>"However, I will beg for the same thing from the master to help you guys get through."
<br><br>Saying that, Ao Qing rushed towards the martial arts school.
