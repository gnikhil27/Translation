Two people and a dog, finally is walking back to the camp.
<br><br>At a glance, they saw Skeleton Ben Wei leaning against the trunk of a tree, a leisurely look about to fall asleep.
<br><br>At the same time, there is a look at the back of his feet to make people think about the woman half kneeling, hammering his thighs.
<br><br>On the ground.
<br><br>Also thrown the finished wine glasses and wine jug.
<br><br>The remaining fragrance of wine was overflowing, and it seemed to be able to associate what had just happened here.
<br><br>"Older brother, this escort of yours is really playing high!"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji said with a smile.
<br><br>"Yeah, really high."
<br><br>Yi Feng skinned a smile, but his pair of gloomy eyes were staring deadly at Skeleton Ben Wei who was about to fall asleep.
<br><br>He would like to see how long this broken skull can float in front of him. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Desolate Wu Dao shook his head, although he did not know how Yi Feng, the guard, could still get a woman in such a place, but it was not his business.
<br><br>But when he saw Yun Lang, his heart was slightly pleased.
<br><br>I thought Yun Lang was in bad luck, but I didn't expect to come back peacefully.
<br><br>He approached Yun Lang and asked in a lowered voice, "Yun Lang, what happened to you, why did it take you so long to come back?"
<br><br>"Your Holiness, I was delayed because of the sudden mist in this mountain, which shielded all my senses." Yun Lang lowered his head and reported back, "This kind of mist is unheard of, I'm afraid it's unusual!"
<br><br>"Indeed, it is unusual!"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"Oh, could it be that your majesty has already discovered the clues?" Yun Lang hurriedly asked.
<br><br>"More than discovering the clues, this is coming for us."
<br><br>Desolate Pathless said in a deep voice, and then told Yun Lang roughly about the encounter with the killing formation just now, and the appearance of Firewalker and the other group of people.
<br><br>"Damn Firewalker and the others, how dare they plot against His Holiness."
<br><br>Yun Lang's face was full of anger.
<br><br>"After all, Fire Xing and others have died, this does not matter, but what makes my heart uneasy is the Water Xing who has not appeared!"
<br><br>I'll give you a task, when the mist in the mountain disperses, you quickly take Yi Feng and others out of here, otherwise the water line comes to me, I'm afraid that they will be involved."
<br><br>At these words, Yun Lang's face was wonderful, and he said meaningfully, "Your Holiness, for the matter of the water line, I think, you are afraid that you have to worry too much."
<br><br>"Hmph, what more worries?"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji scolded: "Less than my kind of cultivation, you simply can not understand the greatness of the water line, usually how I taught you, do not take the enemy lightly do not take the enemy lightly, especially a difficult enemy like the water line."
<br><br>"Uh, your majesty, perhaps you will not believe what I said, but the current water line is really not enough to justify." Yun Lang said with a meaningful face.
<br><br>"What do you mean?" Desolate Pathless asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Your Holiness might as well go and see who the woman who pounded the leg is?" Yun Lang said leisurely.
<br><br>"The woman who pounded her leg?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing inclined his head to look at the woman whose back could only be seen, and asked in a deep voice rhetorically, "What's so pretty about a woman, hurry up and say something, I don't have the heart to sell a story with you."
<br><br>"Believe me your majesty, you go and take a good look, you will definitely be amazed!" Yun Lang said meaningfully.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing's face was tinged with sulking anger, what time is it that Yun Lang is still selling out to him?
<br><br>However, seeing Yun Lang's look, he still held his curiosity and went around to the side to see what the woman looked like.
<br><br>See clearly.
<br><br>It is indeed quite good-looking.
<br><br>But good looking is good looking, but isn't it still an ordinary woman, what's the big deal ......
<br><br>Not right.
<br><br>But the next moment, he reacted with a jolt, he stared at the eyes to look again.
<br><br>This is?
<br><br>Crap!
<br><br>When fully see the woman's appearance, just still face sulking desolate without path in shock straight burst foul, directly jumped up in place.
<br><br>Water line.
<br><br>This woman who pounded her leg was actually Shui Xing!
<br><br>How is this possible?
<br><br>A thunderstorm rang out in Desolate Wuji's head, his heart set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>What was even more incredible to him was that Shui Xing also raised her head to look at him, and despite the strong reluctance in her eyes, she buried herself again and continued to pound her legs for Yi Feng's guards.
<br><br>What the heck is going on here?
<br><br>Desolate Wuji was suddenly confused.
<br><br>This look, is still the same Shui Xing who made him sleep and eat in peace?
<br><br>He rushed to Yun Lang's front with a single arrow step, pulled him aside and asked with an urgent expression, "Tell me, what the hell is going on here, what the hell is happening, how did this happen?"
<br><br>Looking at this urgent look of Desolate Wuji, Yun Lang was filled with a bitter smile.
<br><br>He had long anticipated that Desolate Wuji would look like this, after all, this kind of unbelievable thing, even he, a witness, still looks unbelievable in retrospect.
<br><br>Then, under Desolate Wuji's anxious gaze, Yun Lang told what had just happened, one by one.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Once he finished listening, Desolate Wuji drew a breath of cold air backwards.
<br><br>With a light lift of his palm, he grabbed back Shui Xing who flew out and disappeared!
<br><br>This kind of tactic was unheard of and unseen, not only by Yun Lang, but even by him, his majesty!
<br><br>Doesn't this mean that this guard of Yi Feng's is a hidden super expert?
<br><br>Then this old brother of his ......
<br><br>And who is he?
<br><br>Is it a coincidence that there is such a super escort around, or ......
<br><br>Just as he was guessing, Yi Feng's cursing voice came from the side.
<br><br>"Dog thing, dog thing, I let you be cheap, let you be cheap."
<br><br>Hearing the cursing sound, the two people of Desolation Free Trail inclined their heads over and immediately let them see something extremely incredible ......
