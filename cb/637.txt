"It was a perfect decision to bring these guys back."
<br><br>The entrance of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng a bushel fan, a pot of tea, looking at the big project opened up everywhere, a face of satisfaction.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>Shadow Island and the immortal world's transmission array, is also inevitable.
<br><br>Does every time someone goes in and out, he has to Yi Feng with the transmission?
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Yi Feng will be a daily muddle to save wages.
<br><br>This first.
<br><br>Is eight or nine months.
<br><br>These eight or nine months, not only let the dark shadow island first formed the scale, qi luck points also completely saved enough. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>So Yi Feng in the dark shadow island and immortal world somewhere, and opened a transmission array.
<br><br>Of course, no rules can't make a square circle.
<br><br>So on the Dark Shadow Island side of the teleportation port, Yi Feng put someone in charge.
<br><br>At the same time, rules were set.
<br><br>For example, entry and exit should be registered, and how often are you allowed to enter and exit.
<br><br>But the transmission port on the Immortal World side, also have to send people to guard, even more important than this side.
<br><br>"Send this Jiang to go!"
<br><br>"After all, this Jiang to strength is a bit higher."
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng quickly arranged it.
<br><br>"Yes sir."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi stood respectfully, her face filled with gratitude.
<br><br>She also never expected that Yi Feng would think so highly of her.
<br><br>She knew that although her strength was good, she was completely inadequate in front of the eleven hundred people Yi Feng had newly brought.
<br><br>I didn't expect to give her such a big job.
<br><br>This made her nervous and apprehensive.
<br><br>What if she failed Yi Feng?
<br><br>"I'll send two more people to help you."
<br><br>Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Then two old men, Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong, walked out.
<br><br>"These two people Xian sent to you, if there is anything, you can ask them to help, but don't underestimate them, they are still good at doing things." Yi Feng smiled and said.
<br><br>"Do not dare."
<br><br>Jiang to said hurriedly.
<br><br>She did not dare to underestimate them, on the contrary, she was pleasantly surprised.
<br><br>With the help of these two "Human Immortals", she would be confident that she would be in charge of the entrance to the teleportation array.
<br><br>"Thank you very much, sir."
<br><br>After a moment of hesitation, she added, "Sir, I have one more request."
<br><br>"What request?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Outside of the Immortal Realm, I have a little personal matter to take care of, and I may want to ask these two to help me out when the time comes, so please approve it, sir." Jiang Zhi said respectfully.
<br><br>"Oh, a small matter."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong and said indifferently, "If she needs any help, help out!"
<br><br>"Yes sir."
<br><br>The two old men bowed.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, and then walked into the martial arts school with the teapot.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi's expression was full of surprise.
<br><br>Turning back to Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong, he bowed and said, "Junior, I still ask you two to look up to me."
<br><br>"Haha, small matter, small matter, just now sir also sent word, you need to use us two human immortals, just say it." Lu Qingshan and Wu Yonghong both stroked their beards and laughed lightly.
<br><br>Jiang to a face of excitement.
<br><br>With his head held high, he soon stepped into the teleportation array leading to the immortal world with the two human immortals.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>They arrived at the portal of the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Breathing in the air of the Immortal Realm again, Jiang Zhi's pupils snapped shut.
<br><br>"You definitely didn't expect it!"
<br><br>"I, Jiang Zhi, am back!"
<br><br>"This time, I'm going to get back all that I lost."
<br><br>She thought of the two great immortals behind her, and was full of vigor and confidence.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>She also knew what was more important, and immediately began to prepare the setup of the transmission array on this side.
<br><br>As for the manpower.
<br><br>She was not low in the past, and she still had some of her subordinates.
<br><br>So she directly took out a voice transmission jade slip and summoned her former subordinates to come quickly.
<br><br>A few days later.
<br><br>A dozen High Turning Immortals arrived in response, including one Reincarnation Immortal realm.
<br><br>"Your Holiness!"
<br><br>"You, you actually came out, we thought we would never see you again."
<br><br>A dozen subordinates saw Jiang Zhi with red eyes and kneeled on the ground trembling.
<br><br>"Get up quickly!"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi hurriedly helped the people up, and then said, "I have something to instruct you to do now."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The crowd's eyes lit up and they hurriedly said, "Your Holiness, is it to prepare a revenge plan, is it to take us to fight back?"
<br><br>For a moment, the crowd's eyes looked at Jiang Zhi expectantly.
<br><br>"No, the matter of revenge will be discussed later, I have more important things to explain to you now."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi said.
<br><br>"More important matters?"
<br><br>The crowd looked puzzled.
<br><br>They had been looking forward to Jiang Zhi's return for who knows how long, and now that he had finally returned, shouldn't the most important thing be to fight back?
<br><br>"What exactly is the more important thing?"
<br><br>The crowd asked.
<br><br>"This place is a teleportation array, the future of our task is to guard this teleportation array, record the incoming and outgoing crowd."
<br><br>"Of course, the formation around this transmission array, construction, we all have to act."
<br><br>Jiang to look solemnly instructed.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The crowd had a question mark.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>This is the more important thing?
<br><br>"Your Holiness, what's wrong with you?"
<br><br>The subordinate Jiang Shang, who was in the lead, couldn't help but ask: "What is there to guard this transmission array, multiplying now that Soga Rentu still doesn't know you're out and doesn't have the slightest defense, it's the right time for us to attack the past ah!"
<br><br>"And we have spied that he married the daughter of the Lord of the Three Continents Desolate Immortal Continent after half a month, not to mention the Lord of the Three Continents after the marriage, the woman alone has the strength of the True Element Immortal Realm, once the marriage is completed, the woman is bound to fall in the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent, then we want to make a move, I'm afraid it's not so easy."
<br><br>"The only way to seize this half month, take advantage of the woman is still in the Desolate Immortal Continent, to Soga Rentu, we may have a chance ah!"
<br><br>"But you, but how can you waste your time, on a teleportation array?"
<br><br>That subordinate spoke bitterly.
<br><br>"Shut up!"
<br><br>Jiang to even heard the name Soga Rentu heart hatred, but still coldly out loud scolded.
<br><br>In the beginning, she was the Lord of the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent.
<br><br>Although the Thousand Ancient Immortal Continent was only the lower three continents, but it was one of the strongest continents in the lower three continents.
<br><br>In order to seek the throne of the continent, Soga Rentu went out of his way to sneak in as her subordinate for a thousand years, and after gaining her trust, he injured her while she was practicing, and also used a scheme to murder her and sent her to the Shadow Island prison, and even slaughtered all her numerous subordinates.
<br><br>After that.
<br><br>Soga Rentu naturally sat on the seat of the continental lord.
<br><br>The company's main goal was to create a new and exciting new business.
<br><br>This is a blood feud for Jiang Zhi!
<br><br>According to common sense.
<br><br>The first time she came out, she should indeed go to seek revenge on Soga Rentu.
<br><br>But in her heart she knew better, now she was not only not dead, but she was also able to walk out of the Dark Shadow Island again with greatly increased power, all because of the one on the island.
<br><br>The one who is important to her, not only sent two "human immortals" to help her, but also put her in charge of the transmission array of the immortal world.
<br><br>This trust, she did not dare to slacken.
<br><br>So even in front of the monstrous hatred, she still put Yi Feng's explanation in the first place.
<br><br>"You don't need to say much, follow the orders I just gave."
<br><br>Jiang Zhi Bing's voice came out coldly and unquestionably.
<br><br>The faces of the subordinates were ugly.
<br><br>"Your Holiness, this is really the only chance."
<br><br>"And there are also rumors that when they get married, the Lord of the Desolate Immortal Continent will give him an intermediate level immortal weapon as a dowry, once Soga Rentu has this intermediate level immortal weapon, by then we will have no more chance."
<br><br>The people said bitterly.
<br><br>"Intermediate level immortal weapon, no more chance?"
<br><br>"That's not necessarily true!"
<br><br>"Heh!"
<br><br>Jiang Zhi sneered.
<br><br>Perhaps in the past, intermediate level immortal weapons or the Lord of the Middle Three Continents, she would indeed be scornful as hell.
<br><br>But now, she really did not put it in her eyes.
<br><br>Although she has only been on the island for so long, and that gentleman contact is only so much, but her eyesight followed the upgrade is not a star and a half.
<br><br>So the tang intermediate level immortal weapon.
<br><br>And what does it count?
<br><br>Other than that, just behind the two human immortals, rummaging through the pockets, I'm afraid they can just take out more than a hundred pieces of intermediate immortal weapons, right?
