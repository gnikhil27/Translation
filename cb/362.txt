Sincere voice, from the mouth of black feather chattered out.
<br><br>At the beginning, he was just to save his life to false pretense, but now his exaggerated words, but really with a half sincere.
<br><br>Because his heart is through and through.
<br><br>Compared to this skeleton Ben Wei and that terrifying Yi Feng, that what Green Jade Immortal Continent's continental lord is nothing ah.
<br><br>At least, Su Xuanjun in the immortal river continent, also can not do with bare hands to create immortal.
<br><br>So thinking clearly about all this, he immediately felt what heavenly immortal meat also became unpleasant.
<br><br>Follow this scum and that horrible human, is the real big picture.
<br><br>"Wow, you want to follow me?"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei looked at almost a hollowed out black feather, could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Yes, with you, please let me be your little brother!" Black Feather said sincerely.
<br><br>"No, you are not worthy." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said arrogantly.
<br><br>Black Feather's heart sank, and his face instantly darkened to the extreme.
<br><br>However, then Bone Ben Wei's words made him in rise a ray of hope.
<br><br>"But although you do not deserve to be my little brother, but you can be the master clan back mountain one of them, a bird." Skeleton Ben Wei said.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Black feather instantly happy.
<br><br>Who cares what he became, to be able to follow is good ah.
<br><br>Besides, that back mountain he does not know, on that island.
<br><br>He is clear, that island is directly from the Immortal River continent law power place, the hell knows what will develop into in the future.
<br><br>If the future development of this place, then he is one of the natives.
<br><br>If this scum and the human one day look at him, also rewarded something, is not a good thing.
<br><br>"I'm willing I'm willing."
<br><br>Black feather hurriedly said.
<br><br>"But, there are also prerequisites." Skeleton Benevolent said again.
<br><br>"Please tell me, big brother."
<br><br>Black Feather said respectfully.
<br><br>"Like you almost, bird ah beast ah, you find more over." Bone Ben Wei said, "Because the master also instructed before he left home, he wanted to enrich the animals in the back mountain."
<br><br>"Similar to me, find more?"
<br><br>Black Feather flickered his gaze and nodded solemnly, "Big Brother, this I should be able to do, but I implore Big Brother to promise me that when those guys come, first lock them up in chains for two months."
<br><br>"Have a complaint?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei asked with a raised eyebrow.
<br><br>"Yes, there are grievances."
<br><br>Black feather also does not hide, directly nodded.
<br><br>"How did you bring them if you have a grievance?" Bone Ben Wei asked again.
<br><br>"This, big brother do not worry, I have my own way, big deal to come to a little underhanded." Black feather grin.
<br><br>"Good for you."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei gave Black Feather an appreciative glance, then nodded, "You just need to be responsible for getting it, and let you be the boss of the back mountain in the future."
<br><br>Black Feather's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Immediately kneeled down and worshiped.
<br><br>"Thank you for the promotion, big brother."
<br><br>"Go on."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei waved his hand.
<br><br>Black Feather nodded, and with a high chirp, spread his wings and flew towards the Makufu Mountain Range.
<br><br>Not far away.
<br><br>Ao Qing leisurely leaned against the stone and looked at the seven coyotes playing in the distance.
<br><br>"Brother Dog, how about it, did you swing a stick last night?" At this time, the centipede climbed out and asked.
<br><br>"Hey, two brothers, what is a swing a stick ah, fun, take me with you?" At this time, the black bear milk agent smile hey run, scratching his head and asked.
<br><br>"Roll, young man run away."
<br><br>The dog white milk agent a glance, then proudly towards the night wind said: "What is your dog brother I am, must have waved a few sticks."
<br><br>"Is it true oh?"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede will believe, "Look at sister-in-law like that, it seems that you two pressed ah, and people ignore you or a thing."
<br><br>"Put your sister's fart, she in front of your dog brother obedient OK."
<br><br>The dog said proudly.
<br><br>But the night wind centipede eyes or through the disbelief, can not help but say: "dog brother, I still do not believe, or you call sister-in-law over, in front of me to make out?"
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>"OK!"
<br><br>Dog hate teeth itch, looking at not far away Ao Qingcheng, hesitated for a long time, before pretending to look, waved a paw, shouted: "Woman, come here."
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng moved her red lips and subconsciously took two steps closer towards Ao Qing.
<br><br>The expression, full of hesitation.
<br><br>The two did not say too much, it was really because they had too many enmities and grudges in the past, so they did not know how to face them.
<br><br>"Your man told you to come over, did not you hear?"
<br><br>The dog looked at the centipede like that, in order to take care of his face, stifled his head and shouted, then grabbed Ao Qingcheng into his arms with a claw.
<br><br>Afterwards, it threw a smug gaze towards Night Wind.
<br><br>"Bull!"
<br><br>The Night Wind Centipede laughed heatedly and crawled away with good sense.
<br><br>Then came to Bone Ben Wei and shouted, "Brother, the task you gave me is completed."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei laughed heatedly, looked back at Ao Qing and Ao Qingcheng, and said leisurely: "This silly dog, there are women still wriggling, pretentious, but still have to us brothers out?"
<br><br>"That is, or big brother wise."
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede blew up rainbow farts.
<br><br>"Come on, let them go!"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei said, and tilted his head back.
<br><br>After the Night Wind Centipede left, Ao Qingcheng hurriedly climbed up from Ao Qing's arms.
<br><br>Just about to leave, Ao Qing suddenly shouted, "Wait ......"
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng looked at him, full of incomprehension.
<br><br>"Why don't we find a way to lift the divide, and write off the previous things?" . Ao Qing said.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng looked at Ao Qing unexpectedly and asked, "You don't hold a grudge against me for treating you in the past?"
<br><br>"In fact, I have thought about it a lot, but many things have passed, you are after all the mother of the child, I once treated you ......" Ao Qing lamented: "So we should let go of some preconceptions, for our sake, but also for their sake. "
<br><br>After saying that, Ao Qing will look at the seven coyotes in the distance.
<br><br>"Have you really thought about it?" Ao Qingcheng asked.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Ao Qing nodded his head firmly.
<br><br>Looking at Ao Qing's firm gaze, Ao Qingcheng raised her head and her eyes flushed red.
<br><br>How the past first not to mention, the truth is that she has really endured a lot recently.
<br><br>The white eyes of the clan, the lingering of past grudges, and the pressure of facing Ao Qing, as well as the shame in her heart are tormenting her at all times.
<br><br>At the time of the destruction of the Red Sun lineage, she could have been done with it, but the child in her belly, but she could not do so.
<br><br>So, nowadays, why would she ever not want to turn a dry spell into a good one and live a good life?
<br><br>Besides, the dude is no longer the previous dude.
<br><br>Ao Qing is no longer the old Ao Qing.
<br><br>He can bear everything, can also be her dependence, and can even hold up the entire Sky-devouring Demon Wolf clan.
<br><br>Taking a step back, even if it is still the same once arrogant Ao Qingcheng, whose ideal man, is not also like this?
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>She wiped a handful of tears and nodded her head in agreement.
<br><br>"Just, just what is the method you just said to lift the barrier?" She asked again.
<br><br>"This, this ......"
<br><br>Ao Qing scratched his head in embarrassment, and his legs couldn't help but cover up.
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng looked down, her face instantly reddened, shyly gazed at Ao Qing and scolded, "So what you said seems this?"
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>"This is just now accidentally rubbed by you, only to get up."
<br><br>Ao Qing explained awkwardly, "But don't worry, it's definitely useful because this was taught to me by my big brother, saying that a snap is a way to die off enmity!"
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng hurriedly lowered her head shyly, and only after a long, long time did she whisper, "Okay, just when do you want it, now?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Now?"
<br><br>Ao Qing glanced around and said hesitantly, "That's not very good, right?"
<br><br>"Then you arrange it, I'll comply with you."
<br><br>Ao Qingcheng lowered her head and blushed as she whispered.
<br><br>"Got it."
<br><br>When Ao Qing saw this Ao Qingcheng's appearance, his heart immediately jumped wildly, and he agreed with a bite of his teeth.
<br><br>Then pulled Ao Qingcheng to the back of the stone.
<br><br>"You do not so anxious, and then you change a body ah."
<br><br>"You change."
<br><br>"No, you change."
<br><br>"No, the husband said so."
<br><br>"Okay, okay ......"
<br><br>Also at the peak of Ao Qing's life, Black Feather finally is back to the Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>"Lord of the continent, your dear black feather is back, I missed you so much!"
