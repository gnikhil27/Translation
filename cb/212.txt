The few people carrying the table looked up and glanced at the fifth Changkong few people.
<br><br>Two Martial Dignity, one Martial Sect.
<br><br>Not a bad lineup.
<br><br>If it was in the past, how to see this realm will have to show a smile and say hello.
<br><br>But now, did not give a damn about them.
<br><br>It's okay to talk rudely, and come over to the stinky boom, afraid that others do not know that they are Martial Zun, do not know the rules.
<br><br>The martial arts leader and so what, and not seen, with the strength of Mr., this martial arts hall door even to a few immortals they will not be surprised.
<br><br>In comparison, it is more important to carry things to Mr..
<br><br>Seeing ignored, the fifth Changkong quickly reacted to his own abruptness, re-clasped his fist and said: "Meet a few seniors, I am the young master of the Snow Blower Villa fifth Changkong, this is my Villa Elder fifth array, and this one is the Holy Maiden of the Devil's Voice Sect book Qin painting."
<br><br>"Greetings to all of you."
<br><br>As Fifth Longkong introduced, Fifth Array and Book Qin Painting clasped their fists in greeting at the right time. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Seeing that the other party's attitude was much better, several people only nodded, but they weren't enthusiastic to a fault.
<br><br>"Dare I ask a few seniors, what are you?"
<br><br>At this time, Shu Qinhua looked at this imperial zither platform and couldn't help but ask again, highlighting her attitude in her address despite the fact that she was also a Martial Exalt.
<br><br>"Sir is going to carve this lyre table into a chessboard, and we intend to move it in for him." Lu Qingshan responded towards Shu Qinhua.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"This imperial zither table ...... when ...... as a chessboard?"
<br><br>Book Qin painting instantly smacked his lips, his pretty face was full of incredulity.
<br><br>The fifth Changkong and the fifth formation at the side also similarly opened their mouths wide, filled with shock.
<br><br>Looking at the appearance of these few people, Lu Qingshan several people shook his head.
<br><br>A look.
<br><br>Just have not seen the world.
<br><br>The emperor's piano table as a chessboard so what, they are worried that this thing as a chessboard is not enough.
<br><br>I really do not know if these guys have not seen the world, after going in, see inside the discarded paintings and calligraphy, sacred goods, and many treasures is a what look.
<br><br>"Dare I ask, a few of the gentlemen addressed, is that, is that the one who just struck?" After the surprise, the fifth formation could not help but ask.
<br><br>"That of course, who else in the world can have this kind of elegance except for the gentleman?" Wu Yonghong said with a slight sense of pride.
<br><br>Receiving the confirmation, several people subconsciously respected a lot.
<br><br>After all, in front of such a supreme expert, they didn't dare to posture anything yet.
<br><br>"By the way, seniors, the late generation took the liberty to ask one more question, can that superb zither score be authored by sir?" Shu Qinhua asked again urgently.
<br><br>"That's natural."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan, as a local power, even though he was not involved in the ancient tomb, but he knew all the news there, so he naturally knew what Book Qinpao was talking about the zither score.
<br><br>At these words, Shu Qinhua's face turned sharply expectant.
<br><br>In fact, when Jiang Yu said that the score was not Yu Wujie, she did not feel surprised.
<br><br>Because she suspected from the beginning, how could a person like Yu Wujie compose such a divine song.
<br><br>At least, it is a graceful and spiritual kind of person.
<br><br>Just do not know, that one inside, is not this ......
<br><br>And what is the age?
<br><br>And at this time, there are three more streams of light towards this side of the speed swept.
<br><br>It is Yun Xian Que three.
<br><br>They also witnessed from afar just now over the martial arts hall, that shocking scene.
<br><br>"What are you guys doing?"
<br><br>Yang Mu just landed and looked at Wu Yonghong a few people and sent out a puzzled voice.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people looked at them.
<br><br>Come on.
<br><br>Another few who have not seen the world.
<br><br>"Greetings, gentlemen?" Yun Xian Que, on the other hand, bowed first, and in her mind, there was obviously something more important to ask than this imperial zither platform, and she hurriedly looked at Lu Qingshan and asked, "Senior Lu, could it be that one?"
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan nodded his head.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's body trembled, couldn't help but feel excited, was he finally going to meet the one that Lu Qingshan said was the prophet.
<br><br>At the same time, Yun Xian Que, Shu Qin Painting, Fifth Long Sky and others bowed their bodies and said sincerely, "We would like to pay our respects to that gentleman, can several seniors inform us?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan glanced at them and was not surprised.
<br><br>Only, they do not meet or not to meet his Lu Qingshan a few things, but these people if they do not know the rules, presumptuous sir, that is their negligence.
<br><br>Can't help but, Lu Qingshan solemn gaze swept over them one by one, reminded: "Paying respect to the gentleman is your freedom, but some words have to remind you."
<br><br>The crowd gazed at Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan continued, "Mr. is a supreme master, both cultivation and realm are beyond your imagination, and the reason why he lives here is to return to the basics to feel the life of ordinary people, and even do anything he is personally, never interfere with the cultivation of things."
<br><br>"And just now the strike, but also that Jiang Yu is not open eyes, only to let Mr. forced."
<br><br>"So, when you pay your respects later, you'd better abide by the rules of the gentleman and don't ask or mention matters on cultivation."
<br><br>"Many thanks for the reminder."
<br><br>Several people instantly turned their grateful gazes toward Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>They did not feel that Lu Qingshan was being alarmist.
<br><br>Because just the blow that made Jiang Yu fly into oblivion just now was enough to make them treat it solemnly.
<br><br>"You guys wait first."
<br><br>After Lu Qingshan finished speaking, he greeted Wu Yonghong and the others and continued to move the stone platform in.
<br><br>"Well, it's not bad."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng inside got up and laughed while greeting them and put the stone tablets under the acacia tree in the backyard.
<br><br>"Sir, a few of us will go to work first."
<br><br>Wu Yonghong several people nodded respectfully toward Yi Feng, then took the lines in their hands and went out to work.
<br><br>The remaining Lu Qingshan said respectfully toward Yi Feng, "Sir, some people came outside saying they want to visit you, they should be admiring."
<br><br>"Visiting me? All right then, wait for me to put on some clothes and go out to see." Yi Feng took a breath of cold air, a little surprised, and went to look for clothes.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan, on the other hand, came outside first.
<br><br>Seeing this, Shu Qinhua and the others immediately turned their expectant gazes towards Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>"You guys are lucky, wait here for a while, sir will come out soon." Lu Qingshan reminded.
<br><br>At those words, several people were excited.
<br><br>"Finally, is it time to meet that prophet?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's pretty face was red, this one was an indirect life-saving gift to them.
<br><br>"I just don't know, that songwriter, how does he look like!"
<br><br>Book Qinhua bit her red lips tightly, her face full of tension.
<br><br>"Finally, I can witness that supreme expert who destroyed Jiang Yu with one blow!"
<br><br>Fifth Longkong similarly rubbed his hands together.
<br><br>For a time, the crowd's minds were different, and the same was true of everyone's faces, all showing a strong look of expectation.
