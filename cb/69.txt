The front hall of the martial arts school.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was punching over and over again, and now that he had been learning here at Yi Feng for so long, he had learned a lot, and he was fighting with a strong wind.
<br><br>On the other hand, Ao Qing was lying on the ground, watching with boredom.
<br><br>Tsk.
<br><br>This little boy this boxing is much worse than the master.
<br><br>However, seeing that you feed me every day, forget it, I won't spit on you.
<br><br>Just at this time, outside the door of the martial arts school came a silhouette.
<br><br>It is after a special dress demon Ling'er, beautiful features, enchanting body charm, with a burst of fragrance behind it, look at the street passing crowd eyes explode straight.
<br><br>But the demon Ling'er not even look at these people a glance, all eyes in front of the martial arts hall.
<br><br>She took a deep breath, her expression was full of tension.
<br><br>Because, she was gauging this martial hall so close, of course the reason she came was because she wanted to make a good relationship with Yi Feng in advance. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>After all, there was still a tiger eyeing Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>Although she does not put Mao Yun'er in her eyes in terms of strength, and even beauty is confident not to lose, but her heart is still not bottom, after all, do not know which bite Yi Feng is good.
<br><br>So she came early, but also want to take advantage of the first opportunity.
<br><br>Finally arrived at the door, looking at the shocking stone under the feet and a side drying uncollected rags, she looked complicated, but did not dare to act rashly, gently shouted: "Excuse me, is there anyone?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing, who was boxing inside the pavilion, heard the words and hurriedly came out, saying in a disciplined manner, "May I ask who you are looking for?"
<br><br>"Hello, little brother, I'm looking for Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er said with a lot of style.
<br><br>"Sorry, Master is not here, you can come back another day!" Zhong Qing said with a slight apology.
<br><br>"Not in?"
<br><br>The demon spirit child raised her eyebrows and bit her red lips tightly, then asked, "Then can you tell me where your master went?"
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's face was a little embarrassed.
<br><br>"You just tell me okay?"
<br><br>The demon spirit child winked at Zhong Qing, the style of a thousand asked, the voice among the more with a little provocative dou.
<br><br>Zhong Qing's heart and soul trembled, in the face of demon spirit child such a stunning he did not have half resistance, red face stammered for a long time, only then stammered and said: "Master went to the Yee Hong Yuan to find the lady landlord went."
<br><br>"Yi Hong Yuan?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er beauty eyes flash, seems to have heard some incredible news, quickly asked again: "Then little brother you can not tell me, fighting landlord, in the end is what?"
<br><br>"That is, that is ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing was full of embarrassment and said with embarrassment, "It's that male and female thing!"
<br><br>"Oh!"
<br><br>The demon spirit nodded with deep feeling and looked at Zhong Qing with a smile and said, "Little brother I can't see that you still understand ah, thank you for today, some day my sister will introduce you to one."
<br><br>At once, Zhong Qing's face turned red, but his mouth said, "This, we'll talk about this later, you'd better go back first, I have to practice boxing."
<br><br>Looking at Zhong Qing's appearance, Demon Ling'er's beautiful eyes blinked.
<br><br>It is true that if there is a master, there is a pupil.
<br><br>"Alright, I won't bother you anymore, you'd better go back to practice martial arts first, I'll leave first." Demon Ling'er said in a soft voice.
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded and went back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>Seeing Zhong Qing walking back to the martial school, Demon Ling'er's red lips raised slightly, although she hadn't seen Yi Feng, she had now gotten significant information.
<br><br>She was originally worried, what if a person like Yi Feng was not close to women?
<br><br>After all, to his realm, it is likely to leave this behind, but now that she has gotten the information it seems that this gentleman is gentle on the surface, but behind the scenes is not a decent person ah.
<br><br>In that case, it would be much easier for her to achieve her goal.
<br><br>She left the martial arts school with joy in her heart, but just two steps away, she took one step and looked at the swift cloak that was hanging out next to her.
<br><br>After hesitating for a long time, she clenched her teeth and took the Swift Cloak in her hand.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>Also at the same time, Ao Qing, who was lying in the Martial Hall, screamed.
<br><br>When Zhong Qing saw this, he frowned, picked up the long sword given to him by Yi Feng from the side, and rushed out.
<br><br>And the moment he walked out, he happened to see the scene of Demon Ling'er taking the sheep by the hand.
<br><br>"How dare you steal something?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's small face was tinged with anger as she drank, "Seeing how pretty you look, I didn't expect to be such a person."
<br><br>Demon Ling'er face changed slightly, also did not expect to be actually seen by Zhong Qing, but she did not panic, turned into the style of a lot of looks and said, "Little brother, how about this piece of cloth to me, sister but said to introduce you to the young lady yo."
<br><br>"I told you to put down the rag." Zhong Qing righteously drank: "Although it is only a rag, but I see you clearly, I also do not need you to introduce the young lady."
<br><br>"Little brother, you're not meaningful like this, are you?" Demon Ling'er continued to say with a smile.
<br><br>However, the current Zhong Qing did not eat her at all, and with the long knife in his hand, his tiny body turned into an arc and rushed towards Demon Spirituale.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Such a little trifling kung fu is also paired with my hands?"
<br><br>The demon spirit child laughed disdainfully.
<br><br>But in the next instant, an absolute pressure of might fell on top of her head.
<br><br>What?
<br><br>This knife is ......
