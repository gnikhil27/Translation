"Put your fucking ass, when did I say that I would tell you guys first when I have news?" Night can drink: "That is you guys are pushing yourselves, I did not say anything."
<br><br>The four people were simply furious, pointing at Night Energy, not knowing what to say.
<br><br>"We don't have time to fool around with you guys, something's up, let's go."
<br><br>With a dashing turn back, Night Energy took Ye Yi and flew towards the sky, so that the four people couldn't even catch a trace, and then they had already disappeared.
<br><br>"I know what's going on!"
<br><br>Looking at the direction where Night Energy left, the Heavenly Dragon Valley Patriarch narrowed his eyes, pondering, and then shouted out with a sudden realization.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The remaining three hurriedly turned their gazes toward him.
<br><br>"Maybe this old bastard Night Energy found that senior and got an opportunity from him."
<br><br>The Heavenly Dragon Valley Master said, "Otherwise, there is no way to be able to explain how their father and daughter's cultivation skyrocketed so much in just a few days!"
<br><br>Smell. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The remaining three also dawned on them.
<br><br>"So that's it, night can this old turtle is also too inhuman, actually in the seniors there to get the benefit not to say, but also let us know, want to eat alone ah!"
<br><br>"Hate it, if I had known we would not have been involved in this heaven and earth vision, now it's good, the benefits have been fetched by that father and daughter, we can not even enter the first line of the valley, not even a hair!"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Really angry, if we had been determined to find that senior in the official pond city, that night can father and daughter to get the great opportunity is afraid of us."
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The four people sighed and sighed, their intestines were regretting.
<br><br>"Then what's next?"
<br><br>The Taiyi Valley Patriarch asked.
<br><br>"No matter what this bird barren one-line valley, go to Guan Tang City to find that senior."
<br><br>"Yes, I also agree, this broken one line valley movement is the big one, the mother of all inside is the formation mist, we can't even enter, inside the treasure who the fuck can take away who take, anyway, I am going to find the senior to go."
<br><br>"Good point, find the seniors, even if you can't get the night can they so big chance, but can fish two hairs, estimated than this line valley to the good."
<br><br>The four people immediately made up their minds, and in one fell swoop, they turned into four streams of light and flew towards Guan Tang City.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Two days had passed.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who lived in the broken temple, sighed.
<br><br>After all, it is not a way to live here all the time.
<br><br>So, even though it was still snowing outside, but he still got up and walked out of the broken temple.
<br><br>"It should be impossible to join the clan inside this Guan Tong City." Yi Feng held the map and muttered to himself.
<br><br>Because after staying in Guan Tang City for so many days, he learned that Guan Tang City was controlled in the hands of the four major sects, so it was impossible that there would be other sects that would accept people here.
<br><br>And if you want to find a recruiting point for a small sect, you have to find a smaller city.
<br><br>"Let's go here!"
<br><br>Yi Feng tapped the map and made up his mind.
<br><br>The map showed that in the direction of Guan Tong City to the north, there was Baier City.
<br><br>According to the introduction, Baier City was a small city, but the population was quite large, and there were a lot of fish and dragons mixed in it, and there were quite a few sects that took people there.
<br><br>Yi Feng's feet stepped on the snow, leaving a series of footprints.
<br><br>Soon after, he arrived outside the north gate of Guan Tong City.
<br><br>He stopped.
<br><br>Once again, the map he took out.
<br><br>"According to the map, if you want to go from Guan Tong City to Baier City, you need to cross a big canyon in the middle, and it's not far from Baier City after crossing this big canyon."
<br><br>"But according to the legend, this canyon seems to be quite dangerous, and few people usually walk."
<br><br>"But if you don't take this canyon, you have to walk around and need to walk almost three times more."
<br><br>"How can this be done?"
<br><br>Yi Feng revealed a thoughtful look.
<br><br>A moment later, he made a decision and walked straight towards the canyon.
<br><br>Although the canyon was dangerous, but wouldn't it be dangerous to go around three times in the wind and snow? So far may encounter what it.
<br><br>What's more, in the canyon kind of terrain, but also can block the wind and snow, is simply Yi Feng such fear of cold youth gospel.
<br><br>So as long as you think about it, fools will make this choice.
<br><br>Just thinking this way, a group of people who were also going to Baier City chose to take a detour.
<br><br>"Fools!"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed secretly and headed towards the canyon.
<br><br>Half a day later, Yi Feng saw the legendary Grand Canyon.
<br><br>"This kind of place only needs to walk by the side to prevent rocks from falling from the sky, what other dangers can there be?"
<br><br>"And the wind can not blow, the snow drift can not, simply do not be too good."
<br><br>Yi Feng was very glad that he chose to take this path, did not stay for half a moment, and went in towards the canyon.
<br><br>Beyond the sky.
<br><br>Four figures flew back, it was the four patriarchs.
<br><br>"Damn, after two whole days of turning around in Guan Tong City, not a single hair was found." The Heng Tian Jian Zhai Patriarch said with a lost soul.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"We've never seen that senior, and we don't know what it looks like, so we don't know how to find it at all!" The Taiyi Valley Patriarch was similarly filled with loss.
<br><br>"It's all because of that damned Night Energy, hiding and pinching himself when he has an advantage!" The Canghai Mountain Patriarch cursed furiously.
<br><br>"It's just that, it's better to continue exploring treasures in the First Valley, don't lose the watermelon without getting the sesame seeds." The Heavenly Dragon Valley patriarch said.
<br><br>"That's easy to say, where are the treasures of this First Line Valley so easy to get?"
<br><br>Taiyi Valley patriarch gave a white look and said, "There are countless taboos and all kinds of poisons inside, we can't even enter."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The crowd heaved a sigh.
<br><br>Who said it was not.
<br><br>Who dares to enter the first-line valley at this stage?
<br><br>Even the gods can not come.
