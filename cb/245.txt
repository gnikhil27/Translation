"It's actually Yang Tianyu, the patriarch of the Imperial Sword Sect, and Li Shuhua, the head of the Li family!"
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>The crowd's mouths drew backwards with cool air, feeling their brains spinning.
<br><br>These two people's cultivation levels might not be the strongest, but they were definitely the leading figures of the Southern Sands.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just like that, they were lightly shot down by old man Wang.
<br><br>Especially Li Yihan, she just guessed that the cultivation level of old man Wang and the others might be on par with Yang Tianyu, the leading figures.
<br><br>But in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Yang Tianyu and Li Shuhua were slapped down from the sky by Old Man Wang.
<br><br>This is simply a punch in the face!
<br><br>This wave of shock and vibration today is already a long time for her to slow down. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>And for the strength of Grand Master Wang and others, she no longer dared to speculate on it, because it had surpassed her perception.
<br><br>And Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu, who were shot down, did not recognize Old Man Wang and the others, and were beaten down for no reason, and their hearts were filled with anger.
<br><br>They may not be a match for these old men, but their majesty as the head of the Li family and the patriarch of the Royal Sword Sect must always be there.
<br><br>Immediately, the two sank their faces and questioned.
<br><br>"What exactly are you ......"
<br><br>But just as they were halfway through their words, Yun Xian Que and Fifth Longkong hurriedly winked at them.
<br><br>At the same time, they transmitted a voice: "The two seniors must not be impulsive, they are Martial Emperors!"
<br><br>"What!?"
<br><br>"Wuwuwuwuwu ...... emperor?"
<br><br>This light-hearted sentence fell in the ears of two people, immediately like a thunderstorm resounded, the face rose red, half of the words, by the two of them hard to hold back.
<br><br>"What did you two just say?"
<br><br>However, the meaningful gaze of Pork Rong fell on them.
<br><br>This glance made them look straight.
<br><br>"We mean, what we said was ......"
<br><br>Li Shuhua forehead wiping cold sweat, stammering half a point this only then shouted with a bright idea: "What we want to say is, what in the end you are terrifying as the great power, actually is so powerful, simply let the late generation worship ah!"
<br><br>At these words, Pork Rong only coldly snorted and no longer pursued them.
<br><br>Seeing this, the two people then breathed a sigh of relief and revealed a look of relief.
<br><br>Perhaps they have their usual arrogance as the leader of a major power, but it also depends on in front of what kind of people, in front of the Martial Emperor still maintain this kind of arrogance, this is not looking for death?
<br><br>In short, in front of the absolute strength, arrogance and dignity is worthless.
<br><br>Those who understand the times are handsome!
<br><br>For a time, everyone present was respectful, not daring to breathe a breath, waiting for Old Man Wang and others to give orders.
<br><br>Of course, except for the Yun Xian Que a few people, others, including Li Yihan, have been left with a doubt in their hearts.
<br><br>That is, the strength of these ridiculously strong old man, in the end, who are they?
<br><br>Where exactly did they come from, and what was the reason for suddenly coming to Nansha?
<br><br>But at that moment, a tremor came from the ground violently.
<br><br>"Rumble!"
<br><br>Deafening, the ground cracked open a crack, and the rocky mountain behind him began to suddenly collapse.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here!?"
<br><br>The crowd began to stand unsteadily on the ground, and swept up from the ground to the high altitude.
<br><br>For a time, the high altitude was filled with empty cultivators, and from the high altitude, one could see that the ground they had just stepped on had completely collapsed into it.
<br><br>At the same time, the cracked ground, a terrifying aura came out.
<br><br>This aura, shocked the hearts of the crowd, so that people could not help but reveal the color of fear.
<br><br>"That underground."
<br><br>"What the hell is it?"
<br><br>The crowd stared dead at the crack, emitting nervous voices, even Pork Rong and Grand Master Wang were surging with a heavy color.
<br><br>That terrifying aura is getting heavier and heavier ......
<br><br>The whole sky, the atmosphere became frozen.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Finally, from the middle of that ground, a hissing sound came out.
<br><br>Then, under the dumbfounded gaze of the crowd, a giant snake, a thousand feet long, flew out from the ground.
<br><br>However, when the crowd saw its full appearance clearly, they realized that it was not a snake.
<br><br>Rather, it was a giant auger!
<br><br>It was covered with a huge self-emitting pressure, while two wings grew on its side, and its huge body dinner hovered in mid-air, spitting out a deep, cold air from its mouth.
<br><br>"Oh my!"
<br><br>"What kind of horrible demonic beast is this, actually so scary!"
<br><br>"Run!"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, many cultivators were scared out of their wits and fled towards the distant sky by casting out their Yuan Qi and moving their paws across.
<br><br>"Cackle, I never thought that after 100,000 years of slumber, this emperor would have so many human cultivators as snacks for me as soon as I woke up!"
<br><br>From the mouth of that giant jiao, a deep voice came out, and his pupils stared indifferently at those fleeing cultivators as his huge body moved.
<br><br>In a message, these cultivators were swallowed into its belly.
<br><br>In the slits of the giant teeth, human blood slid down, making people's skin tingling.
<br><br>The crowd was scared by this scene are trembling, originally also wanted to escape some people also stood in mid-air did not dare to move.
<br><br>Even Li Shuhua and Yang Tianyu and others are also pale, because with their cultivation, facing this giant auger, only a strong sense of powerlessness.
<br><br>Can't help but, Li Shuhua will look at Pork Rong and others, respectfully asked: "Seniors, I wonder if you can see, what is the cultivation level of this giant auger?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the other people present also looked their eyes over, obviously wanting an answer as well.
<br><br>"Demon Emperor!"
<br><br>Porky Rong said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>This word instantly set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>The crowd had never expected that it was actually the Demon Emperor.
<br><br>Oh my god!
<br><br>This cultivation alone made them feel their scalps tingle, and I was afraid that everyone present had never seen a demonic beast with this kind of cultivation.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Although the strength of this dragon was also beyond the expectations of Pork Rong and Old Man Wang, there was a strong bright light in their eyes.
<br><br>Glancing at each other, Pork Rong whispered, "Finally, I understand what sir said before, so sir had foresight and knew that a demon emperor was hidden in this piece of land!"
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Old man Wang solemnly nodded his head, likewise whispered emotionally, "I'm afraid that the fresh game that sir said is also referring to this demon emperor!"
<br><br>After saying that, the two of them simultaneously sighed with emotion.
<br><br>Eyes showing reverence.
<br><br>Despite following Mr. for a long time, but the heart still can not help but shock.
<br><br>Eat demon emperor!
<br><br>This kind of crazy thing, I'm afraid that in the whole world, only Mr. has this kind of hand!
