For a while, Yin Shengfu's breathing became rapid, like a madman, studying the chess game on the table.
<br><br>But the more he studied.
<br><br>The more he felt the gap between himself and Yi Feng.
<br><br>And the most terrifying thing was that before he didn't find any clues at all, and even thought that Yi Feng was playing chess without any rules.
<br><br>But until he found that the last piece could not fall, he suddenly realized that he had already lost, and looking back at Yi Feng's previous seemingly unstructured chess fall, but also the actual step for the game.
<br><br>And the side of the desolate pathless and Meng Li Xian also found the same clues.
<br><br>In their mouths, they simultaneously drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>I never thought that Yi Feng had such a high attainment in chess outside of his zither skills.
<br><br>I thought that Yi Feng had lost, but I didn't expect that it was Yin Shengfu who lost.
<br><br>This reversal was unbelievable to them.
<br><br>And what made the three feel even more incredible was not only that. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because if you run Yi Feng's pieces through, you will find that the entire game has turned into a vast star map, and in the star map, a profound aura is lingering and flowing.
<br><br>The power of the Great Dao.
<br><br>It was actually the power of the Great Dao again.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>The three people were almost going crazy at this moment.
<br><br>Didn't we agree that one person would only have one skill, why did Yi Feng's chess skill contain such a powerful dao power in addition to his zither skill?
<br><br>This is simply against the heavenly truth!
<br><br>Inevitably, Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian looked at each other and both saw a strong shock in each other's eyes.
<br><br>Although they couldn't understand how Yi Feng could be proficient in two dao, at least from the looks of it, they had underestimated Yi Feng before.
<br><br>What was even more ridiculous was that they had comforted Yi Feng, worrying that he would be upset because he had lost.
<br><br>Now, it seems that it was completely that they overthought it!
<br><br>Only, even though this chess game contained a strong power of the Great Dao, Desolate Wuji and Meng Li Xian were unable to comprehend it, and even Yin Shengfu did the same.
<br><br>Because this game of chess played by Yi Feng is too profound, just like a martial spirit, even if you give him a copy of the emperor's martial skill in front of him, it is impossible for him to practice, only know its powerful but can not comprehend and dry eyes.
<br><br>Of course, even if you can't comprehend, but those who have the talent can catch a little something.
<br><br>And this is exactly what Yin Shengfu is doing at the moment.
<br><br>Although he had lost completely at the hands of Yi Feng, his achievement in the chess dao was obvious to all.
<br><br>He figured out Yi Feng's chess game and always felt that he had caught something, but what exactly it was was a bit nebulous.
<br><br>But he understood that as long as this point was captured and penetrated, his chess skill would rise a step and enter a new realm.
<br><br>It could not be helped.
<br><br>He trembled and looked towards Yi Feng with a hopeful gaze.
<br><br>Because he firmly believed that as long as he played another game with Yi Feng, even if he couldn't comprehend the power of the Great Dao in it, just by speculating the layout of each move of Yi Feng, he would definitely be able to comprehend it.
<br><br>"What are you looking at me for?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said while drinking.
<br><br>And the tone of voice, not half as polite.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Yin Shengfu's face was filled with embarrassment and embarrassment, but he still bowed with a cheeky face and said, "Senior's chess skill is superior, it's my eyes that are blind, junior has the courage to implore senior, to be able to play another game with junior."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Once he heard this, Yi Feng immediately felt interesting.
<br><br>Just now when he wanted to play chess with him, he said that he wasted his time, and was afraid of defiling his chess board, posing like a dead mother, and now when he saw that he could play chess, he immediately came to kneel and even called senior?
<br><br>"Didn't you say that you would only play one game?"
<br><br>Yi Feng sneered with disdain, "It was you who said that."
<br><br>At that, Yin Shengfu's face was embarrassed to the extreme, and he hurriedly explained, "The game I played with senior just now benefited me greatly, just now it was because I was blind that I said that, now I retract it, I just hope senior can play another game with me."
<br><br>"You retracted it just like that?"
<br><br>Yi Feng sneered with a face full of disdain.
<br><br>Yin Shengfu's face was ugly, but he still bowed and said, "It was junior who was wrong, I still hope senior will give an opportunity to exchange."
<br><br>"No way."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly refused and said without any politeness, "You are as good as a pussy, you can't even compare to Master Zhao who sells bean curd in my old market, you are also worthy to talk to me about communication?"
<br><br>"Hmph, I don't have time to waste with you, you'd better go play with yourself."
<br><br>After saying that, he directly waved his palm, not even care about this goods.
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng still recognize that reason, respect people, people also respect; disrespect people, when the way of others to treat their own body.
<br><br>Originally pretended to be like a two fifty eight thousand, so that Yi Feng really thought he was more powerful, and was looking forward to giving him some experience in chess.
<br><br>But now it seems, is a living color pencil.
<br><br>Yi Feng this nonchalant words, directly let Yin Shengfu an old face rose red.
<br><br>Poof!
<br><br>A mouthful of old blood spat out and sat on his butt on the ground, his face was miserable white to the extreme and full of atrophy.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng said he was a vegetable pussy that sentence, directly broke his dao heart.
