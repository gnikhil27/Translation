The words are rough.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked back with a stern face and continued to curse, "Don't think you are a cultivator is something great, save you still get a bad scolding, this time if not for me, you will cry!"
<br><br>"Hmph, it's only because you helped me once before, otherwise I wouldn't bother with you."
<br><br>The woman in white's face was covered with frost.
<br><br>A mortal, actually lecturing her?
<br><br>But although her heart was uncomfortable, she had to admit that it was indeed this mortal who had saved her just now.
<br><br>"Hey, you still don't seem to be convinced with this look?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a good-natured manner, "Then okay, before you helped me, now I help you, we two do not owe each other, you stay here by yourself, I will go first, but keep you will not take long ah, will be eaten by the beast, and then through its intestines, stomach, and then digestion, and finally turned into a pile of shit out."
<br><br>"No matter what you are a cultivator or a big beautiful woman, in the end, they all become a pile of shit."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and left without any half-hearted delay.
<br><br>Cultivator what? One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>So what if you're good-looking?
<br><br>You're still a piece of shit when you're injured, but you still want me to save you?
<br><br>A fucking thank you is not, but also a face, the old man is not used to you.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words hovered in the mind of the woman in white, her face was filled with ugly.
<br><br>Death.
<br><br>She did not fear.
<br><br>But if it's really like what Yi Feng said, being eaten by demonic beasts and subsequently turned into dung, is something she could never accept.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's back as he left, she finally couldn't help but drink, "You come back."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a tilted head.
<br><br>The woman in white clenched her shell teeth before she spoke, "I misunderstood you just now, I'm sorry."
<br><br>"How nice to have this attitude earlier?"
<br><br>Yi Feng gave the white-clothed woman a glance before walking back with a reluctant face and squatting down in front of her.
<br><br>"This injury of yours, how exactly is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Not too good."
<br><br>Slightly pensive, the woman in white said.
<br><br>"I heard that you cultivators, can recover on your own, is that true?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Mm."
<br><br>The white-clothed woman nodded her head.
<br><br>"Then this injury of yours, how long does it take to recover?" Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>The woman in white frowned and said, "I can't recover in a short time, the one I fought with is a six-life bull demon who has practiced divine powers, and its divine powers can seal my meridians."
<br><br>After saying that, she felt that she didn't need to say so much to Yi Feng, a mortal, so she added: "You don't need to care about this, I will solve the problem of injury by myself when the time comes."
<br><br>"What do you mean you don't need to care about this?"
<br><br>However, Yi Feng directly dislike: "Now we two stay together, your injury problem is not solved, to put it bluntly is a burden!"
<br><br>The woman in white's pretty face was covered with frost.
<br><br>"What, what I said is wrong?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said in a good-natured manner, "Now that your cultivation is sealed, and you can't heal yourself, isn't this look a burden?"
<br><br>The woman in white was speechless.
<br><br>Her cultivation was actually described as a liability by a mortal, which really made her hold her breath, but she couldn't refute it yet.
<br><br>"Ugh."
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head and sighed: "I may not be able to help you with those internal injuries sealed, but these external injuries or whatever, let me help you look at them."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng's palm went towards the white-clothed woman's body.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>The white-clothed woman's face changed and looked at Yi Feng defensively and said.
<br><br>"You stay honestly." Yi Feng said with a stern face, "I'll show you the injury."
<br><br>With that, Yi Feng's palm touched towards the white woman's chest, looking at the white woman's distrustful gaze, Yi Feng added: "Don't worry, I know medicine, your ribs seem to be broken, if not cured, it will be a big trouble, and it will affect your movement."
<br><br>Hearing that, the woman in white hesitated for a long time, looking at Yi Feng's serious look, she only half-heartedly agreed and let Yi Feng's palm reach out.
<br><br>Yi Feng's palm landed back on the white-clothed woman's chest, so that her body couldn't help but tremble gently.
<br><br>Feeling the strange temperature, the pretty face can not say what look, this is the first time a man so close to him, and a mortal.
<br><br>However, looking at Yi Feng's appearance, it seems that he is really checking her injuries, and that palm, although in her private parts, but also did not touch messily, she just gritted her teeth and endured it.
<br><br>"Mmm!"
<br><br>After repeatedly confirming, Yi Feng solemnly nodded and said, "Fortunately, your ribs should only be bone fractures, and other parts are not particularly obvious fractures, I have to say that you cultivators defense is really strong!"
<br><br>"Then how can I get back to action?"
<br><br>The woman in white couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"This only requires a period of recuperation, and you should be able to resume walking." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The white-clothed woman nodded her head.
<br><br>After a slight hesitation, she said, "Thank you."
<br><br>With this word of thanks, she was much more sincere than before.
<br><br>After all, she also felt that Yi Feng was indeed helping her.
<br><br>But the next moment, she found Yi Feng squatting on the ground with his feet and his buttocks half squatting towards her.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>The woman in white couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"What else can you do, hurry up and come up ah?" Yi Feng shouted in no good mood.
<br><br>"Back ...... back me?"
<br><br>The woman in white was stunned, then shook her head hurriedly and said, "No."
<br><br>"No wonder there is a saying that the presence of a woman only affects the speed of the draw, I said you a cultivator how also girly, cool, okay, and do not want, do not how you go?" Yi Feng said with a black face.
<br><br>The white woman's face was ugly to the extreme.
<br><br>This mortal, actually once again reprimanded her.
<br><br>You know, before encountering people, not to mention mortals, even those Martial Saints in front of her atmosphere did not dare to breathe, but this person repeatedly reprimanded her.
<br><br>"You're a tiny mortal, you dare to speak to me like this, aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?"
<br><br>As she said this.
<br><br>Her face was fiercely cold, and a killing intent forced straight out towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng grabbed her palm with one hand and pinned her directly to the ground.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>The woman in white wanted to struggle but had no strength at all, a time red face deadly stare at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"With this you still want to kill me, and a mortal, mortal what, mortal eat your rice, you know you are now worse than me, a mortal." Yi Feng said with a cold face.
<br><br>The woman in white was full of disbelief.
<br><br>This mortal's guts are a bit too big, actually dare ......
<br><br>"You still stare?"
<br><br>However, she was thinking this, Yi Feng's force suddenly increased by two points, and said in a deep voice: "Believe it or not, I directly lock your throat, first fucking lock you to death?"
<br><br>These words into the ears, directly let the woman in white angry teeth itch, but now she is partial to take Yi Feng half can not do anything.
<br><br>"Want to live, first put your damn arrogance first."
<br><br>After a heavy lesson, Yi Feng let go of the woman in white and squatted down in front of her again, while drinking from his mouth, "Why don't you hurry up and give me up?"
