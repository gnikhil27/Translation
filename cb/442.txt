A few days passed in a flash.
<br><br>Qingniu clan small courtyard.
<br><br>"This day, when will the dashing be the end!"
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up the kettle and poured boiling water into the tea leaves, which were soaked in water to stretch and open, wafting a faint fragrance.
<br><br>And Xiaodai and Wu Tao were sitting on the side.
<br><br>While pouring tea for the two, Yi Feng said with a smile and Xiaodai: "Xiaodai, have you thought about it, do you really want to be my disciple?"
<br><br>"Thought about it, I want to follow Brother Yi Feng, no, Master you to learn carving and painting." Xiaodai said with a serious face.
<br><br>"It's okay to learn from me, but you have to return to Dongsheng with me after a while, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng twinkled his gaze and asked leisurely.
<br><br>"Of course it's no problem, just so you can play around." Xiaodai leaped forward and said.
<br><br>"OK, then you pay respect to the master!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>"Master is above, please accept Xiaodai's obeisance."
<br><br>Xiaodai picked up the tea next to him, kneeled on the ground, and came towards Yi Feng to pay homage.
<br><br>"Good disciple, get up."
<br><br>Yi Feng took the tea, took a small sip, and revealed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>This open door red.
<br><br>It is considered proper.
<br><br>Disciple +1.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Tao, what about you?"
<br><br>Putting down the cup in his hand, Yi Feng again inclined his head to look at Wu Tao at the side.
<br><br>Wu Tao smiled.
<br><br>His body trembled slightly.
<br><br>At this moment, he finally figured out the purpose of this person.
<br><br>It turned out that Yi Feng did not want to kill himself.
<br><br>Rather, he wanted to take him as his disciple.
<br><br>Destroying all his arrangements and seeing through all his tricks was just proving with his actions that he had the absolute strength to be his master.
<br><br>If in the past, he Wu Tao would not have agreed, although he was afraid of death, but not necessarily without pride.
<br><br>But now, Wu Tao had to admit that he was convinced of Yi Feng's strength.
<br><br>"Master is above, please accept my apprentice's obeisance."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an served tea and immediately knelt on the ground.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>Seeing Wu Tao talk so well, Yi Feng immediately revealed a satisfied laughter.
<br><br>An honest man is an honest man.
<br><br>It was done without the slightest effort.
<br><br>Disciple +1 again.
<br><br>So Yi Feng hurriedly took the tea and drank it down in one gulp.
<br><br>And seeing Yi Feng drink the cup of tea, Wu Chang'an's eyes instantly turned red.
<br><br>It was even a bit like crying.
<br><br>It is hard to imagine how he came through this time.
<br><br>Inner heart every day with a thousand pounds of heavy burden, every moment feel the threat of death.
<br><br>At this moment, it was finally dissipated.
<br><br>He Wu Changan.
<br><br>Finally safe.
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng pulled out a blank talisman paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table.
<br><br>"Wu Taoa, I often seem to see you will draw some talisman before, you draw really not very good ah, this spread out to lose your master's face ah!"
<br><br>"See master teach you to draw one, you have to see clearly."
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng hand brush a move, the paper brush ink like a pale dragon spread, a brand new talisman paper drawing out.
<br><br>"Look at it, is it much better than yours?"
<br><br>Yi Feng pushed the talisman paper over.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an trembled at the sight.
<br><br>The excitement on his face was unspeakable.
<br><br>The power contained within this one teleportation talisman made Wu Tao feel frightened, he felt that if he used this talisman, he would be able to directly break through the barrier of the Immortal River Continent and teleport to the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>"Aiya, just one talisman, no need to be so excited, although I don't know what use this talisman will be to you, but don't worry, when I teach Xiaodai to draw, you learn a little next to me, soon you will also be able to draw such quality." Yi Feng said with a soft smile.
<br><br>"Thanks a lot master."
<br><br>Wu Tao held the talisman paper in his hand and hated to give it a kiss.
<br><br>Ah!
<br><br>This world, so safe!
<br><br>At this moment, he felt that his chances of dying living in this world had become lower than ever.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>Is this the feeling of hugging a big leg?
<br><br>Really good ah!
<br><br>"By the way, Master, how do you spell the word "tea"?"
<br><br>On the side, Yun Wu waved the brush in her hand, scratching her little head and couldn't help but ask towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What, little dance can't even write the word drink tea?" Yi Feng asked with a smile.
<br><br>"Just watching us drink tea here, suddenly remembered that these two words can't be written."
<br><br>Yun Dao scratched her head in embarrassment.
<br><br>"Okay, I'll teach you."
<br><br>Yi Feng took the brush and slowly fell on the rice paper.
<br><br>The handwriting was strong and pale, as if it came to life.
<br><br>"Master's handwriting is so beautiful." Xiaodai looked at the handwriting on the rice paper and said with a face full of admiration.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>His own cultivation can not, these skills are really nothing to say.
<br><br>It's just bad luck to cross over to this kind of cultivation world, if you come to a world of worship, you can definitely mix well, maybe even become a great state teacher or something like that.
<br><br>Shaking his head, shook off the distracting thoughts, casually pressed the cup in his hand on the rice paper, then Yi Feng got up and said, "Let's go, haven't you always wanted to paint landscapes, let's go to the back of the mountain."
<br><br>"Okay master."
<br><br>Xiaodai excitedly packed up the things needed for painting, and then followed Yi Feng, a group of three people rushed towards the back of the mountain.
<br><br>And shortly after the two had left, two figures with difficult steps appeared outside the courtyard.
<br><br>It is the night can father and daughter two.
<br><br>Coming here, the two have long been mountainous and shaky.
<br><br>It is hard to imagine how hard it was for them to get here to Yi Feng without cultivation and under extreme pain.
<br><br>But when they walked into the courtyard and took a look, they found that there was no one there.
<br><br>"Sir is actually not in ......"
<br><br>Night can inner grief and despair, pale face bloodless, full of resignation.
<br><br>They only had seven days to live from the moment they were struck by the soul-suppressing nail.
<br><br>When the time is up, the soul will be scattered.
<br><br>However, from the place where they were thrown off the flying boat, even if they didn't stop for a moment, they had already used up nearly seven days to get here.
<br><br>In other words, they only had the last two hours left for father and daughter.
<br><br>"Yes, is the sky going to kill us?"
<br><br>Night Yi was also full of despair.
<br><br>Under the destruction of such an overwhelmingly fierce weapon as the Soul Suppressing Nail, both her mind and body were suffering tremendous torture all the time.
<br><br>She was a woman, originally could not hold on at all, and was able to walk here, only by virtue of the thread of faith in her heart.
<br><br>So when rushed to find Yi Feng was not there, enough to imagine the despair in her heart.
<br><br>Two people collapsed on the ground, feeling the passage of time little by little ......
<br><br>But originally thought that the end of the mountain will soon die night can, but was surprised to find that the mental state is actually much better.
<br><br>Even the pain caused by the soul-suppressing nail, also reduced a lot.
<br><br>"Yi'er, do you feel it?"
<br><br>Night Energy asked with a trembling voice.
<br><br>"Father, are you also much better?" Night Yi asked with equal excitement.
<br><br>"Then do you know what's the reason?"
<br><br>Night Energy asked busily, "Could it be a return of light from our father and daughter?"
<br><br>"No, it seems to be a clear fragrance ......"
<br><br>Night Yi said uncertainly: "This fragrance, it seems to be ......"
<br><br>"Tea fragrance?"
<br><br>Speaking of which, Night Yi seemed to remember something, and climbed up with difficulty to turn her gaze to the stone table next to her.
<br><br>In a flash, a voice of alarm came out of her mouth.
<br><br>"Father, get up and look!"
