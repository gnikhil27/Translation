"You, go back to the Castle Peak Sect, and come back to report any news at any time."
<br><br>The Xuanwu old ancestor slapped Yu Wujie on his chest, Yu Wujie opened his mouth in pain, an ice cicada flew into his mouth and was then thrown out.
<br><br>"Master, will it be not too good to ask Senior Brother Wu-Chen to go alone?" Demon Ling'er looked at Elder Xuanwu who was frowning at the top and asked worriedly.
<br><br>"No harm."
<br><br>The Xuanwu Old Ancestor waved his hand and said.
<br><br>"Aren't you afraid that there will be any danger to Brother Wu-Chen?" Demon Ling'er asked with a frown.
<br><br>"Senior sister, just don't worry!" At this time, a man clad in a long robe came and said, "I think that what's that Pingjiang City highbrow is just a blindfold put out by that Castle Peak Sect, it's better to ask Senior Brother Wudu to solve it."
<br><br>"Can ......"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er still seemed to have some concerns, and her eyes looked at the Xuanwu Elder.
<br><br>"There is no need to worry so much." <br><br>The Xuanwu Old Ancestor said, "Dustless has my Heaven-shattering stone in his hand, even if there are any accidents, that Heaven-shattering stone will be able to protect him from worry, so we just need to wait for news of Dustless in the sect."
<br><br>When she heard the words, Demon Ling'er breathed a sigh of relief. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>With the Zhentian stone in her hand, then she really didn't need to worry about it, which was one of the few supreme treasures in the hands of the Xuanwu old ancestor.
<br><br>......
<br><br>In less than half a day's work, Jing Wuchen had arrived at Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Pingjiang City is close to the Immortal Cultivation Sect, but there are more mortals, so there are quite a few martial arts schools of all sizes in this city.
<br><br>But for Jing Wuchen, this is not a problem, and he solves the problem simply and brutally, by killing the door directly.
<br><br>He walked out of a martial arts school with evil and cold blood on his morbid face, and everyone in that martial arts school was slaughtered and empty.
<br><br>He rushed on to the next martial arts school.
<br><br>After killing dozens of people up and down the martial arts school, he trampled the martial arts school owner under his feet and said coldly, "Say, what is your relationship with the Castle Peak Sect?"
<br><br>"I, I, I, I, I really have nothing to do with the Castle Peak Sect, Lord, please spare ......" However, before his words were out of his mouth, a cold ray of light had already swept past his neck.
<br><br>"It's really no fun!"
<br><br>The demonic face flashed with impatience, his tongue licked the blood on the dagger, and after stomping the head of the martial arts school owner with one foot, he continued to run to the next martial arts school.
<br><br>In this way, Jing Wuchen followed the map of Pingjiang City and slaughtered one martial arts school after another, leaving no one, male or female, old or young ......
<br><br>"Disciple, I bought you some candy to eat along with the medicine."
<br><br>Yi Feng walked back from the outside with a big bag, and for this disciple, Yi Feng was also uncaring.
<br><br>"Thank you for your concern, Master."
<br><br>Zhong Qing was full of gratitude, his eyes contained water mist, since he could remember, except for his parents, only Yi Feng was sincerely good to him, and he also kept this kindness secretly in his heart.
<br><br>"Ouch."
<br><br>However, just after entering the door, Yi Feng stumbled over the steps and almost fell to the ground.
<br><br>"Master is all right!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing hurriedly came and held Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Damn it, this broken design." <br><br>"The design is simply anti-people tired.
<br><br>You can step on one step, it's too short, and you have to take small steps like a woman.
<br><br>You can take two steps at a time, and it's even worse.
<br><br>"Master, I will finish this step tomorrow." Zhong Qing said in a hurry, hitting his heart for Yi Feng, and he was very eager to do things for him.
<br><br>"Good boy."
<br><br>Yi Feng touched his head and said, "You have just recovered from your illness, these things will be said later when you are well, go, go in first and take the medicine."
<br><br>Then, the master and disciple walked towards the inner courtyard and watched Zhong Qing finish the medicine, and only then did Yi Feng put down his heart and lie down on the recliner to bake in the small sun.
<br><br>Recently, he was in a good mood.
<br><br>Zhong Qing was well.
<br><br>He also has money.
<br><br>It's just that it's a bit boring.
<br><br>"Doggie, come here."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved at Ao Qing, and the dog came running with his tail wagging, lying obediently under Yi Feng's feet and letting him rub the ton.
<br><br>The street.
<br><br>A fresh breeze brushed by, and the leaves were blown messy.
<br><br>A figure landed in front of the martial arts school, he lifted his bony palm to look at the map and narrowed his eyes, "The last few martial arts schools are getting smaller and smaller, it's really disappointing!"
<br><br>With that, he licked his tongue and walked towards the martial arts school in front of him.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
