"Old man don't get excited."
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hurriedly explained, "I just saw that you have an itchy chess player here and wanted to play a game of chess with you, nothing else, and since we are going to play chess, we can't play against a dead game, right?"
<br><br>"So what's the point of keeping this dead game, might as well start over and have a new painful game."
<br><br>"Do you think so?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly and divided the pieces in the chess urn into black and white, and filled them up separately.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng's smile at this moment was so profound and inscrutable in Ye Tian Sheng's eyes.
<br><br>And his mind was echoing Yi Feng's words.
<br><br>What is the point of keeping a dead game, it is better to start over ......
<br><br>Him.
<br><br>Is it hinting at something? Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng sat down again, while holding down his anger because the game was destroyed.
<br><br>Because his strength in front of Yi Feng, angry or impulsive, there is no point.
<br><br>It is better to calm down and take a good look at what the purpose of this one in front of him is.
<br><br>In this way, perhaps, there is still a ray of hope for the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>The other side.
<br><br>At the same time when Yi Feng put away the chess game, a layer of invisible fluctuations rippled over the Heavenly Sword Sect, and then under the gaze of countless people, a barrier shattered like a bubble.
<br><br>At the moment of shattering, the entire Heavenly Sword Gate emitted a deafening sound.
<br><br>Under the shaking of the sky and the earth, countless buildings collapsed, and the ground cracked out with a crack that could not see the bottom.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The Heavenly Sword Sect's great mountain protection formation and foundation were actually destroyed."
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>"Run, the whole mountain gate is about to be stepped on, run."
<br><br>And as the building collapsed and the root was destroyed, countless broken formations leaked, making the whole Heavenly Sword Sect covered with killing machines everywhere.
<br><br>So at this moment, miserable screams rang out all over the Heavenly Sword Sect, and countless disciples began to fly towards the outside of the mountain.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>"Could it be that there was a change at the old ancestor's place?"
<br><br>"Could it be that the Heavenly Sword Sect, which has been passed down for countless generations, is about to be destroyed?"
<br><br>High in the sky, Duan Qingfeng and the others watched as the entire Heavenly Sword Sect began to cave in beneath their feet, their eyes covered with blood.
<br><br>But even so, with tears in his eyes, he quickly made the most correct response.
<br><br>"Pass down the order for everyone to evacuate the Heavenly Sword Sect."
<br><br>Although the mountain door was destroyed, it was impossible to let the disciples in the mountain door be buried here along with it.
<br><br>"Old Uncle, it's starting."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled faintly, holding the white piece in his hand, he slowly fell towards the chessboard.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng nodded, but when he looked at the chessboard, his whole body was staggered.
<br><br>Especially the moment when Yi Feng's hand fell with the chess piece, it was like throwing a stone into a calm lake, which caused a ripple on the whole board.
<br><br>At this moment, the entire chessboard changed.
<br><br>The surrounding environment has also changed.
<br><br>Two people sitting in the void, the vast starry sky above their heads, lingering light, the ground formed a gossip diagram.
<br><br>A black and a white, yin and yang were clearly distinguished.
<br><br>"This is ......"
<br><br>"This is the power of the Great Dao?"
<br><br>Ye Tiansheng was stunned, his heart was already set off a shocking wave.
<br><br>Ordinary cultivators, if there is a martial intent penetration, as if an epiphany when the sudden and rapid progress.
<br><br>But the power of the dao is another level, a little bit can get the qi luck plus body, improve not just the strength, but the whole hostage to improve.
<br><br>And want to break the emperor into immortality, also need to comprehend enough of the power of the great dao.
<br><br>But since ancient times, the entire immortal river continent martial emperor thousands of millions, can break the emperor into immortality but only a few.
<br><br>It is clear what the power of the Great Dao means to the cultivator.
<br><br>However, in the immediate surroundings of the chessboard, the power of the Great Dao was contained everywhere, which made Ye Tian Sheng's mouth go dry.
<br><br>Can do this hand.
<br><br>Only heavenly immortals can do it.
<br><br>In other words, the youth in front of him ...... is a heavenly immortal!
<br><br>Hiss.
<br><br>Ye Tiansheng mouth backwards cold air.
<br><br>Of course, what makes him even more incredible is that the youth in front of him is not to strike him, but instead is to grant him a heavenly opportunity.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>On the one hand, he broke the foundation of his Heavenly Sword Sect, and on the other hand, he gave him a great chance.
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng was puzzled.
<br><br>However, if you don't understand, but when faced with a chance like the power of the Great Dao, no one has the ability to resist.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>Ye Tiansheng exhausted his mind, racking his brains to start a game with Yi Feng.
<br><br>But what he never expected was that no matter how he laid out, Yi Feng would always have insight into his intentions, and every time he was in danger, Yi Feng would put a way out for him in a desperate situation.
<br><br>"Hmm!"
<br><br>"This old man's chess skill is not bad, it's been a long time since I played chess this painfully, it should add a lot of experience to me!"
<br><br>Looking at Ye Tian Sheng, Yi Feng sighed in his heart.
<br><br>But it's almost time to let go of the water for so long.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly and then dropped the last piece.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"A draw."
<br><br>Ye Tian Sheng looked at the chess game in front of him and was filled with disbelief.
<br><br>Because there were countless times when Yi Feng could have beaten him, but in the end, it ended in a draw, what did this mean?
