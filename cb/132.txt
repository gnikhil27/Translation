"Miss Miss."
<br><br>Mao Mao gasped in his mouth and patted his small chest and said, "Our formation is operating normally, there is no problem at all."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Hearing that, just sitting down Bai Piao Piao also can't help but fiercely stand up in shock, red lips slightly open, eyes flashing full of unbelievable color.
<br><br>"Miss, you should quickly figure out, what is going on!" Mao Mao said anxiously: "Obviously the formation does not have the slightest problem, how on earth did he, a mortal, get in?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao knitted her pretty eyebrows, unable to come up with a half-way reasonable explanation for a while.
<br><br>"Miss, I'll arrest that mortal and give him a severe beating to force him to speak out." Mao Mao saw the situation and said with her small mouth clenched in her teeth.
<br><br>"Don't be rude."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao quickly scolded: "Yi Gongzi you and I are not the first contact, he is not a liar."
<br><br>"Then what is this all about?" Mao Mao said with a face full of confusion.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao shook his head, also still can not say a reason, a hundred puzzled. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Room.
<br><br>After settling down, Yi Feng brought a bucket of water and poured a packet of prepared powder into it. This medicine powder is not too big role, but only has a cleaning effect, by the way can also bring some fragrance.
<br><br>After all, it is also a place for two girls, as a big man can not be too indiscriminate.
<br><br>After wiping the whole body once, Yi Feng dragged his tired body directly to sleep down.
<br><br>The mountains in late autumn.
<br><br>In addition to the occasional wind, the silence is frightening.
<br><br>A night passed.
<br><br>The red sun, against the sky slowly emerged, very nice.
<br><br>Due to the reason of sleeping too early, Yi Feng had got up at this time, stretched a lazy back, feel fresh.
<br><br>He wanted to go down the mountain directly, but the sky was not yet fully light, so he had to sit on the steps and watch the sunrise in the sky.
<br><br>Thinking of that broken system's task, Yi Feng got up and took his guitar out.
<br><br>"Can practice for a while, let's practice for a while, and then go down the mountain when the sky is completely bright."
<br><br>Tuned the strings, and then closed his eyes.
<br><br>The strings fluctuated, and with Yi Feng's soft humming, the song "The Price of Love" was slowly played out.
<br><br>The pool of water.
<br><br>White floating sitting next to the long zither, jade hand stroking the long zither, beautiful eyebrows deeply frowned.
<br><br>Recently forced by the bottleneck, she desperately needs a song to break, but another night unknowingly passed, still nothing.
<br><br>However, just then, the sound of a unique zither song filled her ears.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's shriveled spirit, fiercely stunned, pulled up her long skirt and got up to look in the direction of the sound.
<br><br>"This is the room where Duke Yi is?"
<br><br>She opened her red lips slightly and followed the voice involuntarily.
<br><br>On the steps.
<br><br>A hand clutching a guitar, squinting his eyes and humming softly the sound of the green shirt, reflected into her eyes.
<br><br>Calm.
<br><br>Good looking.
<br><br>Ning and ......
<br><br>It seems that there is a different kind of beauty!
<br><br>involuntarily, white floating looking at this figure lost in thought, do not know when also followed the eyes closed, immersed in this song.
<br><br>Being in it, many emotions came pouring out of her, and two lines of tears unknowingly slipped from her eyes.
<br><br>The bottleneck that she had been stuck in, she also had an enlightenment at this moment and broke through.
<br><br>However, the joy of the breakthrough did not allow her to get out of the emotions in this song.
<br><br>Long long long long ......
<br><br>"Miss Piao Piao?"
<br><br>A gentle voice came, causing Bai Piao Piao to wake up with a jolt.
<br><br>She hurriedly wiped away her tears, bowed towards Yi Feng and said in a rush, "Sorry, I was accidentally immersed in your son's song, so I made him laugh."
<br><br>"Miss Piao Piao is polite, rather I am sorry to the girl." Yi Feng put away his guitar and said apologetically, "I'm afraid I woke up the girl to rest, right?"
<br><br>"No, no, it's a blessing for Peopeo to hear a song from you in her past life." Bai Peopeo hastily said, "Speaking of which, Peopeo still can't get enough of your tune."
<br><br>"You're welcome."
<br><br>Yi Feng pinched his nose and laughed rather embarrassingly.
<br><br>"I don't know what kind of qin you have, why has Piao Piao never seen it before?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao looked at the guitar in Yi Feng's hand and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"A homemade gadget!" Yi Feng explained with a smile.
<br><br>"Homemade?"
<br><br>This answer made Bai Piao Piao feel amazed and couldn't help but exclaim: "Gongzi is really versatile."
<br><br>"Miss's compliment makes Yi Mou too ashamed to accept it." Yi Feng smiled while looking at the sky and said to Bai Piao Piao, "Miss Piao Piao, it's already dawn, I'm leaving."
<br><br>"Your Excellency is in such a hurry?"
<br><br>Bai Peopeo's heart was suddenly empty, and quickly said with anxious color: "Gongzi want to ......"
<br><br>But she wanted to say something but stopped.
<br><br>"No way, there are still things at home, farewell, see you again sometime."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled apologetically, picked up his guitar, carried the bamboo basket, and did not forget to pick up the old kingfisher, and was ready to leave.
<br><br>Seeing this, Bai Piao Piao's anxious color became more intense, and she bit her red lips before finally speaking, "Piao Piao wants to invite the gentleman to stay here for two more days, is it okay?"
<br><br>After saying that, Bai Piao Piao looked expectantly at Yi Feng, and her pretty face surged with a touch of scarlet.
<br><br>This was the first time she had ever extended an invitation to a person of the opposite sex.
<br><br>"No way."
<br><br>However, Yi Feng directly refused.
<br><br>After saying that, with an apology, Yi Feng raised his steps and quickly went down the mountain, after all, his heart was thinking about Zhong Qing's injury.
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao, however, was directly stunned at the spot.
<br><br>Just like that ......
<br><br>refused?
