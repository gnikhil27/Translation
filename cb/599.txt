Liu Yan rarely saw Yi Feng so well behaved, and breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>And then turned back to a white-robed youth at the front of the disciples and instructed, "Yang Yi, you are the highest cultivation and the best talent inside my Star Peak disciples this time, when the time comes ......"
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly opened his mouth and interrupted Liu Yan's words.
<br><br>Liu Yan, as well as all the elders and disciples, all turned their heads to look at Yi Feng in confusion.
<br><br>"The peak master said he is the most powerful without argument, but you can't say he is the most talented." Yi Feng gave a playful laugh and patted his chest, "Don't forget me."
<br><br>Liu Yan was amused by Yi Feng's roguish show-off appearance.
<br><br>The elders and disciples next to him also laughed.
<br><br>Even Yang Yi, who was always serious, couldn't help but look at Yi Feng.
<br><br>His eyes carried a faint smile.
<br><br>Liu Yan looked at Yi Feng's appearance and secretly said that this child is also in a good state of mind. The most dangerous thing about this trial meeting is that he is. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>He can still be so calm, joking and amusing with everyone.
<br><br>This mentality is good, there is no one else.
<br><br>"Good good, you are the most talented." Liu Yan said, turning back to Yang Yi, "This time, I will let a few powerful disciples follow you, you are responsible for keeping an eye on Yi Feng."
<br><br>"It's best not to let him out of your sight."
<br><br>"This way even if Sun Moon Peak wants to kill him, you will have a fighting chance."
<br><br>"Even if you are not defeated, I believe in your ability to bring Yi Feng away." Liu Yan solemnly instructed.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Yang Yi also answered with solemnity.
<br><br>The incident at the Life and Death Stage made him realize the irreconcilable conflict between Sun Moon Peak and Star Peak.
<br><br>Yi Feng's bold and courageous nature was something he had never seen before, who had always been cautious and introverted.
<br><br>Not afraid of power, dare to stand up for their own life and death to fight or even refute back.
<br><br>He respects.
<br><br>Also cherish such people.
<br><br>Liu Yan ordered what he should order, and then got up.
<br><br>"We are still a little short of Sun and Moon Peak, this time I will make an exception and open the outer secret realm."
<br><br>"Our secret realm is a place that my Sun Moon Sect does not open easily, cave door blessed land, spiritual energy is a thousand times more than outside."
<br><br>"You all go in to cultivate and absorb, although only two days, but I believe you can also improve a little from it."
<br><br>"As for how much you can improve, that depends on your creation."
<br><br>The disciples were excited at the words.
<br><br>Among them, Yi Feng, who was standing at the far side of the crowd, was the most excited.
<br><br>He rubbed his hands and his eyes glowed.
<br><br>He knew that his talent was rare in ten thousand years.
<br><br>Just come to the immortal world these days, did not do anything to be able to rise several ranks.
<br><br>If you get to the secret realm where the spiritual energy is a thousand times more abundant, I'm afraid I don't have to do anything, just lie there and sleep.
<br><br>Cultivation will be able to drift up.
<br><br>Once you think of this, Yi Feng will be fist pumping eager to try, so excited.
<br><br>Soon, a group of people followed Liu Yan to the outer secret door outside.
<br><br>In front of them, there are steps with golden air, hanging in the air upwards.
<br><br>It stretched to the middle of the air, and then there was a gate with golden light.
<br><br>Liu Yan led a group of disciples up the ladder.
<br><br>Yi Feng also followed behind, and soon arrived at the gate.
<br><br>Several elders began to form seals in their hands to activate the gate talisman seal.
<br><br>At this moment, Liu Yan turned back, his gaze swept over and saw Yi Feng behind the crowd.
<br><br>Lifting a step, he walked up to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"In the quota for entering the outer secret realm this time, there was originally no you."
<br><br>"I was thinking of a condition that I owed you before. So I fought for this opportunity for you."
<br><br>"Of course, if you don't want it, I won't make it difficult for you, just ......"
<br><br>"Yes, of course."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly interrupted the words that Liu Yan had not yet finished.
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng's answer, Liu Yan nodded her head, which was within her expectation.
<br><br>"This time our Star Peak and Sun Moon Peak tit for tat, let them harbor hatred. But among them, the hatred towards you is definitely the most."
<br><br>"In the disciple trial in three days, they will definitely find an opportunity to make a move against you."
<br><br>"Although I asked Yang Yi and other powerful disciples to help you as much as possible, I'm afraid that Sun Moon Peak's tactics are impossible to defend against."
<br><br>"More people to help you can't resist getting stronger on your own."
<br><br>Liu Yan said in a serious tone, "I know you have good talent, so this time you go in and try to cultivate more."
<br><br>"Make sure to seize the opportunity to raise your cultivation to the highest that you can."
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Yi Feng was also grateful for the arrangements Liu Yan had made for himself this time.
<br><br>Although it might not be of much use.
<br><br>But with this heart, he was grateful.
<br><br>Plus this opportunity of the outer secret realm. It could be said that what Liu Yan could do for himself, he did as much as he could.
<br><br>Yi Feng thanked Liu Yan.
<br><br>A rumbling sound came from the side.
<br><br>It was the elders who had opened the gate of the outer secret realm.
<br><br>Liu Yan turned around and said to the group of disciples in front of him, "Go, come out in two days."
<br><br>All of them answered and entered the outer sect secret realm before and after.
<br><br>Once inside, through the boundary, a white fog filled the air.
<br><br>It was like a fog, and you couldn't see people farther away when you went in.
<br><br>Mighty thick white fog, so that everyone who is in it, feel relaxed and happy.
<br><br>Those accumulated in the body and heart of the distracting thoughts also in this instant was melted away.
<br><br>It is like being washed.
<br><br>After walking through the white fog and going inside, in a short while, I saw a hot spring pool spewing white liquid.
<br><br>It was a pool of spiritual energy.
<br><br>Because it was too thick, it had converged into a white emulsion.
<br><br>There was a thick white mist coming from above.
<br><br>Yang Yi stood at the front of the crowd, and he pointed to the futon spread out next to the hot spring and said, "You can sit there and cultivate."
<br><br>"Everyone start cultivating, don't waste time."
<br><br>"Yes!" Hearing Yang Yi's command, the crowd went forward and found a futon to sit on. Prepare to start cultivating.
<br><br>This secret realm is very thick in spiritual energy, and this hot spring is the source of spiritual energy.
<br><br>The entire mysterious realm, this is the most dense place of spiritual energy.
<br><br>Yi Feng also want to find a futon to sit, but there are too many people.
<br><br>And ...... looked at the people sitting on the futon with their eyes closed and began to exhale.
<br><br>Yi Feng's brow was locked.
<br><br>Shit.
<br><br>He does not know how to exhale ah ......
<br><br>You know, he has never cultivated.
<br><br>No one had ever taught him either.
<br><br>The hell know how to cultivate?
<br><br>Forget it, pretend to mix it up a bit, can absorb a little is a little.
<br><br>Yi Feng's gaze swept over and landed his gaze in the hot spring.
<br><br>Inside the white emulsion spread throughout the pool, the top is still bubbling with a faint white gas.
<br><br>To say that the entire secret realm, where the most dense spiritual energy.
<br><br>There is nothing better than a spring.
<br><br>Thought to this, Yi Feng did not hesitate to go in toward the hot spring pool.
<br><br>The white gas instantly covered his entire body and filled his whole body.
<br><br>The whole person soaked in the hot spring, what feeling there is no ah.
<br><br>Yi Feng touched the lotion.
<br><br>In the end there is no use ah.
<br><br>He thought of those outside the brothers swallowed gas and exhaled the look, he also followed sitting in the pool, than a posture of the same.
<br><br>Swallowing air ...... exhale ......
<br><br>Still do not feel anything.
<br><br>Come on, just sleep on it!
<br><br>He yawned.
<br><br>At the same time, the entire space in the secret realm changed.
<br><br>The disciples who were preparing to exhale and those who had already started to exhale opened their eyes one after another.
<br><br>"What's going on? Didn't they say that the spiritual energy here is a thousand times more than outside?"
<br><br>"How come this sucking up feels like only a few dozen times at most?"
<br><br>"It's not." Some disciples who cultivated earlier also wondered, "I could feel that it was indeed thick when I started to exhale just now, but just all of a sudden, it changed!"
