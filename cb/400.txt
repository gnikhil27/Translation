"How is this possible?"
<br><br>Bai Piaoqiao was incredulous to the extreme.
<br><br>This place was clearly not reset by their advanced formation, how on earth did a mortal like Yi Feng find his way here?
<br><br>This really surprised and surprised her, and she quickly said, "Go Mao Mao, go and greet Mr. Yi."
<br><br>With that, Bai Piao Piao was full of surprise dragging her long skirt and trotting towards the door.
<br><br>The four men, who had heard that someone had found their way here, also showed the same incredulous look.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on?"
<br><br>The man in the lead stared majestically at the rest of the men and asked in a deep voice, "Say, was there any negligence in the process of setting up the formation by you?"
<br><br>"My lord, we did set up the formation as you instructed, and we also checked it from the beginning to make sure it was okay."
<br><br>Several subordinates hastily lowered their heads and explained towards the man in the lead.
<br><br>Obviously, they were also full of confusion about someone suddenly coming to the door. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The man in charge frowned tightly.
<br><br>After pondering for a moment, he then said, "Go, first follow me to see what this person's origin is, and by the way, let's see if there is any problem with the formation eye outside."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Several people quickly chased towards Bai Piaoqiao.
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao had already dragged her long skirt to the door.
<br><br>The white robe, clean-looking, gentle and elegant, courteous figure once again appeared in her eyes.
<br><br>This brought back many memories for her, especially that time after Yi Feng left, she couldn't help but sleep in the nest he left behind ......
<br><br>Can't help but, Bai Piao Piao's pretty face turned scarlet.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, long time no see."
<br><br>Yi Feng chuckled softly.
<br><br>"Yes long time no see."
<br><br>The same gentle voice came from Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>"How have you been lately?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Thank you for your concern, all is well with Peopeo." Bai Piaodiao said softly.
<br><br>And just as the two were talking, the men chased after them, and the first thing they did was to land their eyes on Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>The sharp gaze almost sized up Yi Feng from head to toe.
<br><br>He was flat, with no cultivation.
<br><br>After the measurement, they directly gave Yi Feng a conclusion in their hearts.
<br><br>"My lord, the formation eye is also still there, and there is nothing wrong with the formation." At this time, one of the subordinates whispered in the head man's ear.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the head man's gaze shifted slightly and dropped his gaze to one of the inconspicuous flowers among the flowers outside the courtyard.
<br><br>The flower was in full bloom, very nice, and there was nothing wrong with it.
<br><br>Yi Feng glanced at these people, after a polite nod, continued to exchange pleasantries with Bai Piao Piao, "Miss Bai, this time I came in a hurry, and did not bring any gifts, I am really sorry, so I was only able to take the local material."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, then turned around and walked towards behind him.
<br><br>And after confirming that the formation was okay, the head man's gaze never left on Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>But no matter how much he looked, he couldn't feel the slightest threatening force in Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>"How to look at it is a mortal, is the arrival of this person really a coincidence?"
<br><br>He lowered his head and murmured secretly.
<br><br>But when he raised his head again ......
<br><br>En?
<br><br>His eyes glared.
<br><br>Then he saw Yi Feng's palm, landing on the root branch of one of the flower petals.
<br><br>"So I can only take the local material and give Miss Bai a flower, implying that Miss Bai's youth will last forever, and wishing Miss Bai a life so flowery!"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled gently.
<br><br>Finished, the palm of his hand slightly force.
<br><br>Seeing this, the leader of the man's face changed greatly, stretching out his palm to stop Yi Feng.
<br><br>But just as he made a move, he heard a "creak".
<br><br>A slight twig breaking sound came out, the blooming flower petals are already in Yi Feng's hands, and handed towards Bai Piao Piao.
<br><br>Looking at the flower petals in Yi Feng's hand, Bai Piao Piao's pretty face was filled with red.
<br><br>This is the first time a person of the opposite sex has given her flowers.
<br><br>Somehow, the heartbeat is actually beating especially fast.
<br><br>And what is the meaning of this flower delivery by Mr. Yi?
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao heart can't help but think like this ......
<br><br>"En, could it be that Miss Bai is disgusted?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"How, how could."
<br><br>Reacting, Bai Piaodiao hurriedly explained, "I like the flowers that Mr. Yi gave me very much."
<br><br>After saying that, Bai Piao Piao took the flower petals with both hands and held them in her hands, the high tip of her nose could not help but come over and lightly smell the fragrance of the flower petals.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng smiled faintly.
<br><br>To be honest, come here to bother so many times, he did not bring half a gift, the heart is quite sorry.
<br><br>This is not, also had to so in a hurry, get a small flower to send a send.
<br><br>As expected.
<br><br>Girls are not too resistant to flowers.
<br><br>However, looking at the two of you to me, the next few people have long been full of anger, anger has been about to erupt from the eyes.
<br><br>Heart.
<br><br>More is dripping blood!
<br><br>The most important thing to set up the whole formation is the eye of the formation, the hell knows how much they have paid for setting up this formation eye, but this damn mortal tore it down, is unbearable.
<br><br>"Kid, you're here to cause trouble, right? Die!"
<br><br>The leader of the man shouted, palm flipped, a slap towards Yi Feng.
