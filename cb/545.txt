"What?"
<br><br>The Genting king clutched his chest and took several steps backwards before he slowed down.
<br><br>"What's going on with this broken Genting Empire of yours?"
<br><br>On the side, Perdition roared hysterically, "Mouth talking about the largest empire in the Lingxu Realm, countless countries and sects are under your control, now it's a good thing, the mutiny of the mutiny, even a small Wu Tian can't hold back, what the hell is your Cloud Top Empire doing for food?"
<br><br>"Calm down for a moment, calm down for a moment!"
<br><br>Seeing this, the Cloud Top king hurriedly pacified, turning his pupils and said, "The mutiny of several small sects, this is also something I did not expect, but things have not come to that point yet, the big deal is that I asked the one who is in seclusion in the underground palace to come out early."
<br><br>Extinction eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>Asked in a deep voice: "This person you are talking about, what exactly is he?"
<br><br>"Will he be able to stop Wu Tian's attack?"
<br><br>"Hey, don't worry about this, this person is an absolute heavenly genius, his future achievement is definitely no less than you and I. He is the pioneer representative of the new generation of my Genting Empire, a proper supreme genius." The Genting kingdom ruler said confidently.
<br><br>"The ultimate genius?" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Reliable spectrum?"
<br><br>Perishable couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>There were really too many things happening today, and he felt unreliable about everything.
<br><br>"This you absolutely rest assured."
<br><br>The Genting king said with a pat on his back, "This person is a native of my Genting Empire, I knew a few years ago that he was a good seedling and used the resources of the Genting Empire to train him with all my might."
<br><br>"And now he also lives up to my expectations, after traveling around, his strength has grown significantly, and recently reached the edge of the breakthrough, which is in the cloud top ground palace where I have arranged the spirit gathering array to close!"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Exterminate this is a slight sigh of relief.
<br><br>"However, you talk about this person so excellent, it is better to hurry up and call him out and take a look!"
<br><br>"Good, at this moment, we can only ask him to come out early!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch breathed a sigh of relief, and then walked down towards the underground palace alone.
<br><br>Not long after.
<br><br>With a smile on his face, the Genting Kingdom Monarch reentered the palace.
<br><br>"How was it?"
<br><br>Perdition asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, Heaven helps me, Heaven helps me."
<br><br>A bright laugh came from the Genting Kingdom Monarch as he said excitedly, "When I went to look for him, he just happened to have an early breakthrough, wait a little while and he will be able to come out immediately!"
<br><br>The Genting Monarch's voice had just fallen.
<br><br>Outside the palace, a pleasant booming sound came out.
<br><br>Then a black shadow figure, blasting out from under the ground, stepped in mid-air and stood in the air.
<br><br>"Out of the gate!"
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch's eyes lit up as he and Perdition glanced at each other and hurriedly walked out of the palace.
<br><br>Then was seen.
<br><br>In the sky, the young man in black was floating with long hair in front of his forehead, a black robe without wind, and a long spear with a leisurely glow in his hand was cold.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>He carried a powerful aura, so that the entire sky filled in a thick pressure.
<br><br>"My subordinate, Yuan Zun, pays respects to the king."
<br><br>In mid-air, the black-clothed youth bowed slightly, and a respectful voice came out.
<br><br>"Good, free of salute and flatten yourself!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler laughed loudly and hurriedly waved his palm.
<br><br>"I don't know what is the reason why the kingdom ruler is in a hurry to call me out of the gate?" The Yuan Zun flickered in mid-air with his languid pupils and asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"Good, then let's make it short."
<br><br>"Recently, there is a Wu Tian who does not know what is good and bad attacking my Cloud Top Empire, while the two of us are busy with other important matters can not be away, now ordered you to go forward to fend off Wu Tian's attack, after the two of us to draw hands, and then this person will be killed under the sword!" The Genting king said.
<br><br>Yuan Zun heard the sound.
<br><br>A grim look flashed on his face.
<br><br>"A little thief, how dare he attack my Genting Empire, he simply does not want to die, I will rush to the front line, please also ask the kingdom monarch to wait for my good news."
<br><br>Finished speaking.
<br><br>Yuan Zun held a long spear, like a god of war dragged out a rainbow light in mid-air, and flew towards the front line.
<br><br>Seeing Yuan Zun's thunderous appearance.
<br><br>Genting king nodded with satisfaction.
<br><br>Looking to the exterminator at the side, he could not help but ask: "How is it?"
<br><br>"This son is indeed good."
<br><br>"The strength is also indeed strong enough, unexpectedly ah Genting, you actually still have such a good seedling hidden in your hands." Perdition couldn't help but laugh.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha."
<br><br>"My Genting Empire has stood in this world for so long, and not without reason, whoever really thinks of my Genting Empire as simple, then he is really finished, hahahaha." The Genting king laughed heartily.
<br><br>"All right, since with this Yuan Zun's restraint, this Wu Tian can't make any big waves for a short time, let's do our business as soon as possible and start laying out to restore our qi!"
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>The two of them laughed cheerfully.
<br><br>They returned to the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>Then they followed the guidance heavenly book and started a new round of layout.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed.
<br><br>With Yuan Zun's restraint, Wu Tian did not need them to be in charge for the time being, and the two people who were focused on putting things on Qi Luck, had made some achievements and had recovered a lot of the lost Qi Luck.
<br><br>Two people looked up.
<br><br>Showed a heartfelt smile.
<br><br>"These days, it's returning smoothly again." Perdition said.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler nodded and said, "On Wu Tian's side, Yuan Zun might not have been able to kill Wu Tian, but I think that with his strength, he was also completely able to hold Wu Tian in check, and might have even recovered some of my Genting's lost territory."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>His voice had just fallen.
<br><br>A subordinate hurriedly rushed in, kneeling on the ground and shouted, "The king is not good, Yuan Zun has defected, not only has he defected, he also took the initiative to open the defensive formations of all the cities and let Wu Tian's army in."
<br><br>"Now Wu Tian's army, is less than three cities away from the Imperial City!"
