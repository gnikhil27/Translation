"Huh, fourth brother, you didn't come to take me back?"
<br><br>Burial Five blinked his eyes and laughed meaningfully.
<br><br>In fact, when Burying Four came, he guessed this result.
<br><br>Just ask the world, who came to this island and did not think of joining the Heaven and Earth Sect?
<br><br>So at this moment he also intentionally wanted to flirt with Burial Four.
<br><br>"Hey, Old Five, don't laugh at me, it's because I have eyes without pearls!" Burial four embarrassingly said: "or you old five see through, or you old five smart, to be honest, that what extinction, I looked long ago also does not look like good people."
<br><br>"This heaven and earth door is really fragrant ah!"
<br><br>"But old five ah, do you think if I join the Heaven and Earth Gate, can I jump a few feet away on this island like that Ambassador Lu?"
<br><br>"Another thing is, do I have a chance to get two high-level immortal weapons to play with as well?"
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>Burial Five laughed at his words and said, "Fourth Brother, what's a few feet away in one jump, our brothers and teachers on the island are no longer pursuing these external powers." First issued domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Then what are you guys pursuing?"
<br><br>Buried four busy asked.
<br><br>"What we pursue is the dao, the law. As the saying goes, there are three thousand dao in the world, but here in the master, there are endless dao, even the unheard of and unseen by you." Burial Five said with a proud face.
<br><br>"Great Dao."
<br><br>"Laws ......."
<br><br>Burial Four murmured excitedly, with a sizzling light in his eyes, already impatient to join the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>"As for what you say senior immortal weapon ah, let's put it this way, as long as you become a disciple of the master, as long as you want, the divine weapon pavilion inside a variety of divine weapons at your disposal, just afraid that you stay in the heaven and earth door for a long time, the general immortal weapon what you can not see." Burial five said again.
<br><br>"Aiya old five, you do not say, fast fast fast, quickly think of a way to help brother to join the heaven and earth door." Burial Four said impatiently.
<br><br>"Haha, although the master has strict requirements for disciples joining the sect, but as long as there is a Heaven and Earth Sect flyer, I think there is no problem to join." Burial Five said with a smile, "After all, most of the division brothers inside the sect came in because of the flyers."
<br><br>"According to the master's statement, those who can receive the flyer are the Chosen One, they are destined to the master and to the Heaven and Earth Sect, so as long as they go through a process, they will be able to join the Heaven and Earth Sect directly!" Burial Five said.
<br><br>"Leaflet, I have, I have haha."
<br><br>Burial Four hurriedly took out the flyer that belonged to him, and after giving it a wild kiss, he pulled Burial Five and said, "Luckily I kept this flyer, I really have foresight!"
<br><br>"Go go go, Old Five quickly take me."
<br><br>Old Five said impatiently.
<br><br>Subsequently, Burial Five took Burial Four to Yi Feng to simply go through a worship process, and after being poured some chicken soup by Yi Feng, he was considered to have truly joined the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.
<br><br>Burial Four followed Burial Five and had completely integrated into the Heaven and Earth Sect.
<br><br>He spent the whole day in the book collection pavilion and was even more obsessed than Burying Five.
<br><br>Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>Black African Tribe.
<br><br>The three Tibetan brothers swept through the air at a great speed.
<br><br>Originally, they should be in the Chaos Hall at this moment, waiting for the opening of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet.
<br><br>It's just that the Heavenly Zen Inflammation Lotus, which their Black African tribe had guarded for ten thousand years, was ripe at this moment.
<br><br>There was one effect of the Yan Lotus.
<br><br>After taking it, it can greatly enhance the human potential, cultivation talent, but also to obtain the extreme inflammation body.
<br><br>It is a low level infinitely close to the intermediate level of the immortal medicinal material.
<br><br>So for the ripening of this heavenly treasure, the three brothers naturally do not dare to take it lightly.
<br><br>While the three people rushed all the way towards the place where the Yan Lian is ripe, Burial One couldn't help but say, "Old Two, Old Three, Old Four has been looking for Old Five for most of the month, why hasn't he come back yet?"
<br><br>"It should be soon." Burial Two said.
<br><br>"Could there be some kind of change?"
<br><br>Burial One couldn't help but speculate again, "Old Four and Old Five have always been close, he wouldn't have listened to Old Five's compulsions and gone to join that Heaven and Earth Sect too, right?"
<br><br>"Big brother what are you talking about, you still don't worry about Lao Si's work, he swore before he left that he would bring Lao Wu back, so you can rest assured!" Burial three hastened to say.
<br><br>"Yes, big brother, the fourth person never say one thing, since he said he would bring back the fifth, will definitely bring back the fifth, you just put your heart in your stomach, in two days they will also come back." Burial two said.
<br><br>"Also, the old four things still let people rest assured."
<br><br>Thinking of this, burial one also nodded and relaxed, "Then let's wait for two days."
<br><br>In the middle of the conversation, the three of them finally arrived at the place where the Yan Lian was blooming.
<br><br>The appearance of the hot lotus is similar to the snow lotus.
<br><br>Only the two are one cold and one fire, one only has a chance to be born in the land of extreme cold.
<br><br>The latter is naturally in the land of extreme heat.
<br><br>The surrounding area was barren, the ground was hot from time to time, there was no hint of green, and the air seemed to be smoldering with flames inside.
<br><br>"The Inferno Lotus should be able to ripen in half a day, with this Inferno Lotus, after us brothers take it, our talent and cultivation should be able to go to a higher level, and we can also obtain the Extreme Inferno Body." Burial One looked at the Yan Lian and couldn't help but say.
<br><br>Burial Two Burial Three was also nodding excitedly.
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother and third brother, we are back."
<br><br>Just then, two breaths rushed in from afar, accompanied by the voices of Bury Four and Bury Five.
<br><br>"Old Fourth and Old Fifth?"
<br><br>Three people's eyes suddenly lit up, also did not expect, just now the road also talked about two people, two people so quickly back.
<br><br>So the three, hurriedly greeted towards the two.
<br><br>"Old four, old five, you guys are finally back."
<br><br>"Yes, old four you really do things to make people feel at ease, really say one thing, said bring back the old five and bring back."
<br><br>"This time we five brothers can finally gather together and wait properly for the opening of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet."
