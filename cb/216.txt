The courtyard.
<br><br>Yi Feng had a stern face and dragged out a sack of gold coins from the utility room.
<br><br>These sacks of gold coins, I'm afraid there are several tens of thousands.
<br><br>On the side, the skeleton was tied to the acacia tree, mouth stuffed with a shoe, humming ah ah mouth can not speak, the dog is also trembling on the side, do not know how time.
<br><br>"Say, where did the money come from."
<br><br>Yi Feng casually took out a bamboo piece from the kitchen, came to the skeleton's front, asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!"
<br><br>
<br><br>Yi Feng took the shoe out of his mouth and his questioning gaze continued to stare at him.
<br><br>"Aba aba!"
<br><br>The voice just fell, a bamboo strip pumped over, hitting the skeleton straight jumping feet. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Say something human to Laozi, hurry up and say."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the bamboo strip again, forcing the question.
<br><br>"Pick up, pick up ......"
<br><br>The skeleton trembled and answered.
<br><br>"Sure it's not stolen?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked again in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Really ...... not ah!"
<br><br>The skeleton hurriedly said.
<br><br>"Ow ow ow."
<br><br>Seems to echo the skeleton's words, the dog also timely sounded out.
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng looked at the dog.
<br><br>The dog is a bit humane he knows, all day long follow this broken skeleton he also knows, the dog this meaning is obviously also helping the skeleton to explain, then this gold coin should really not stolen.
<br><br>But think about it.
<br><br>This goods although not a lot of trouble, but stealing chicken and dog this thing, really have not done.
<br><br>"Okay, let you off this time, but these gold coins ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, immediately let the dog and skull will be nervous gaze open over.
<br><br>The eyes are very pitiful.
<br><br>Looking at the appearance of these two goods, Yi Feng said, "Don't worry, will leave some of them to you."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>A bone and a dog, is considered a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Afterwards, Yi Feng dragged several sacks into his room and hid them, before he walked out again.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng reappear, a bone and a dog again will look at the expectant gaze again.
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head and said breathlessly, "Here you go, now you go, right?"
<br><br>The skeleton suddenly opened its palm urgently.
<br><br>"Take it well, save it, don't give me any trouble." Yi Feng explained in a serious tone towards the skeleton, before placing a gold coin into his hand under the skeleton's dumbfounded gaze.
<br><br>"Oooh ...... just, just one?"
<br><br>Looking at the hand of a gold coin, the skeleton voice choked, want to cry.
<br><br>"How have to, too little?"
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously frowned.
<br><br>"No, no opinion, woo, woo ......"
<br><br>The skeleton held the one gold coin with both hands, the body fell to the corner, cowered and sat on the ground.
<br><br>Looking up at the sky above his head.
<br><br>Sky.
<br><br>Really blue, oooh ......
<br><br>And at this time, from the martial arts school left the fifth long air and cloud Xian Que and other people did not go far.
<br><br>The more they thought about the fact that Book and Qin Painting had obtained such a great opportunity, the more they were unwilling to do so.
<br><br>"Elder, why don't we get a house to live around the sir's martial school, just as this sir's neighbor, as long as time goes by, we will always be able to get the sir's chance." Fifth Changkong had a bright idea and said towards the fifth formation.
<br><br>"This is a good idea, near the water to get the moon first!" The fifth formation immediately said appreciatively towards the fifth long air.
<br><br>And a few people on the side, Yun Xian Que and Yang Mu, seeing this, also had a bright gaze.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This method is very feasible ah!
<br><br>A few people, in order to get Yi Feng's chance, instantly took note and planned to buy a house in the vicinity of the martial school.
<br><br>"They're all just mortals, we'll definitely be able to buy a house next to the martial school if we give them twice the price." The fifth formation said.
<br><br>The people nodded their heads and after some selection, they found that the house of Martial Hall's Grand Master Wang's house was quite compatible with their conditions, both in terms of distance from the Martial Hall and in all aspects.
<br><br>A knock sounded on the door.
<br><br>Grand Master Wang propped up his cane and opened the door, glanced at the men and women at the door with a slightly deeper meaning and asked plainly, "What is it that a few of you are looking for me, a little old man?"
<br><br>"Hello old man, we have taken a fancy to your house and want to buy it, you can just offer a price, we can meet you." The fifth formation opened the door and said.
<br><br>"Buy my house, huh?" Grandpa Wang said somewhat flattered, "What's so good about this little old man's house of mine, it's gloomy and dark, not suitable for the gentry ladies of big families like you!"
<br><br>"What are you talking about, old man, your place is top notch in both orientation and all aspects, as we said earlier, old man, you can make an offer, we can accept it all." The fifth formation said again.
<br><br>"Alas, forget it!"
<br><br>Master Wang waved his hand and said, "I am half into the earth, money is of little use to me, and this place I have lived for so many years, also have feelings, just want to raise a pension in this place, you should find someone else!"
<br><br>At these words, the fifth formation and other people's faces changed slightly.
<br><br>But they will not give up lightly, after glancing at each other, the body slowly reveals a touch of cultivator's breath, said: "I'm not going to lie to the old man, we are cultivators, since you do not want money, then we can give you a promise to give you some life-prolonging medicine, to keep you alive for decades, in addition, will pick the best house in other places in Pingjiang City! What do you think?"
<br><br>"Forget it, the old man does not need all this, and this stay for decades in the house, has long had feelings can not move down." Master Wang politely refused.
<br><br>The crowd's faces were stony.
<br><br>Never thought that this decrepit old man actually soft and hard, especially he is only a small mortal, actually half sell their cultivators face.
<br><br>Can't help but, the fifth formation tone aggravated a few points, said in a deep voice: "What if we have to buy this house?"
<br><br>"Alas, you guys better go!"
<br><br>Grandpa Wang shook his head, propped up his cane and was about to turn back and leave.
<br><br>"Well, well, old man, since you are soft and hard, then you can't blame us, we can only ask you to go out."
<br><br>Yang Mu finally couldn't help himself, a foot into the room, the palm of his hand probed out and fell to the shoulder of Grand Master Wang.
<br><br>But however, the hunched and thin body, but not moving, the old man just flatly inclined his head and said, "Although the old man is old, but the strength still has a little."
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>"I can't imagine that you old man is still hiding quite deep!"
<br><br>Yang Mu's face changed slightly, his body's cultivation moved, and the force of his palm once again increased by a few points.
