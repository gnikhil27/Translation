Could it be that he was, saw that I was carrying the heirloom of the Li family, the ring of space?
<br><br>Can't help but, Li Jiaxin again remembered Yi Feng's cast-off question - you will definitely have a way ......
<br><br>In that case, it seems to be the only possibility.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but glance at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng was wearing a faint smile, looking at her.
<br><br>Sure enough, this look, speaks for itself!
<br><br>It seems that this one, seems to be a bit more terrifying than imagined, he has long seen through his identity and also knows that he has the Ring of Space on his body.
<br><br>This means I'm afraid that not only the Martial Dignity, but the existence of the Martial Saint ah.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin gritted her teeth, and for a moment it was a little difficult to make a choice.
<br><br>After all, her Li family's ring of space is not an ordinary spatial treasure, ordinary spatial treasures can only store dead things, but the ring of space can hold anything, even living people.
<br><br>In addition is the size of the space, is an ordinary storage bag of ten thousand times more, is considered to be a small world of its own.
<br><br>Of course, the ring of space is not simply a control treasure, or a protection attack treasure, with the hand if you feel the owner is in danger, will automatically issue an attack.
<br><br>However, the one in front of her has given her no small chance after all.
<br><br>This kind of chance that acts directly on the realm and state of mind is not something that can be compared to external things.
<br><br>"You guys wouldn't have no way, right?" Yi Feng skimmed his mouth, looking slightly disappointed, it is reasonable to say that cultivators to do so should not be difficult, ah, since there is really no way, Yi Feng had to say: "Forget it!"
<br><br>But Yi Feng's words fell on Li Jiaxin's ears, it was like full of mockery.
<br><br>It was more like saying to her, "I promised you a chance, but you are not even willing to give something outside the body, I wanted to make a good karma, so let's forget it!
<br><br>It is so harsh.
<br><br>The indecisive Li Jiaxin looked at Yi Feng, who had already turned around, and suddenly felt like she had lost something, something she hadn't grabbed, and her heart suddenly became empty.
<br><br>"Wait, sir."
<br><br>So Li Jiaxin hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Yi Feng turned around.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin bit her red lips, took off the Ring of Space in her hand, and said softly, "This is the Ring of Space you need."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled, a slight surprise appeared in his eyes, if his guess was good, this should be the storage treasure that was necessary for cultivators in his previous life when he read novels or watched TV, right?
<br><br>"Please also accept it, senior."
<br><br>Since he had already decided to give it away, Li Jiaxin stopped squirming and handed it to Yi Feng with both hands respectfully.
<br><br>"Good, then I will accept it."
<br><br>Yi Feng accepted it with a smile, this thing could be too important to him, and the corpses of these beasts were perfectly fine to get down the mountain, so he wasn't too polite, and in his opinion, every cultivator had this thing, so it shouldn't be much of a valuable thing to them.
<br><br>"Sir, I'll teach you how to use it." Li Jiaxin said.
<br><br>However, as soon as her voice fell, Yi Feng waved his hand and said, "I know."
<br><br>"You, know?"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin immediately revealed her astonishment.
<br><br>"Isn't it just a drop of blood to recognize the master?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed, this method he had read a lot in the novels of his previous life!
<br><br>However, Yi Feng's light-hearted words set off shocking waves in Li Jiaxin's heart.
<br><br>After all, the other storage treasures in the Immortal River Continent did not have the words of blood recognition, basically they were all hit with their own breath to recognize their owners, yet this one broke through the key in one word?
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>It turned out that this one didn't just know that she had the Ring of Space, but even knew how to use the Ring of Space.
<br><br>She had, indeed, not misjudged Yi Feng's mind!
<br><br>Subsequently, under Li Jiaxin's eyes, Yi Feng directly dripped blood to recognize it, and the way to open the Ring of Space was instantly clear in Yi Feng's mind.
<br><br>However, this made Xu Mozhu incredible, shocked gaze to Li Jiaxin.
<br><br>"This ring of space, but your Li family treasures, you, you just gave it away?"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu asked incredulously.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin also looked slightly complicated, but she still said, "Some things come, to be decisive enough to grab, I hope this time, I did not bet wrong!"
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu sighed and said, "Although this person is strong and has given us both this opportunity, but I think you directly take out the ring of space, or a little abrupt, and even a little unworthy ah!"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin eyelids jumped.
<br><br>Obviously, she appeared to be decisive on the surface, but in reality, she was also playing a drum in her mind.
<br><br>She slightly raised her head, and her expression was somewhat complicated.
<br><br>However, between her head, something inadvertently appeared in her eyes, causing her beautiful eyes to involuntarily widen.
