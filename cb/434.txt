Several people sighed and sighed for a long time.
<br><br>Thinking about the great opportunity, even the opportunity for the entire sect to rise right in front of them, but the four people want to give up their hands, for nothing to that old son of a bitch Night Energy.
<br><br>A burst of heartache.
<br><br>Regret of the intestines are blue.
<br><br>"Forget it, things have passed, our eyes are clumsy, can't recognize senior means it is also a matter of our qi, I think senior will not take it to heart, after all, those who do not know are not to blame, let's talk about what to do next, right?" After calming down, Liu Gu Yi could not help but ask.
<br><br>"Yes, think of a way, how to approach that one?" Li Canghai asked.
<br><br>"I don't think there's any need to rush."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong said with a thoughtful look in his eyes, "Since we know the identity of this senior, there will be plenty of opportunities later, we must not go up to him abruptly."
<br><br>"That's a good point."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian nodded and said, "Especially now that that old bastard Night Energy is there, if we go up like this, we might get stirred up by him."
<br><br>"En, we can wait until they are gone, go to that small store to poke around, it's not too late to make a decision." Liu Gu Yi said. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Several people nodded their heads in agreement.
<br><br>Re-concealed.
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, the four swept out into the air and arrived at the entrance of the small store.
<br><br>"Is there anyone there?"
<br><br>The four people collected their breath and arrived at the entrance of the small store.
<br><br>"A few guests, what would you like to buy?" Yunmu smiled as she came out.
<br><br>"Ahem, looking for you to ask a matter." With a cold snort, Jian Hengtian began to ask fiercely, "Next, you just need to tell us everything you know."
<br><br>Seeing Jian Hengtian's fierce appearance, Yunmu took two steps back in fright and asked in fear, "What do you want?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Liu Gu Yi hurriedly glared at Jian Hengtian.
<br><br>With a smile on his face, he walked up to Yun's mother and asked softly, "Boss, don't be normal with him, we are here to find someone."
<br><br>"I don't know what kind of person you are looking for?" Yun Mother asked as she gave Liu Gu Yi a look.
<br><br>"Looking for a man named Night Energy and a young man in white, we are friends with them, we heard others say that they stopped by your store, is that right?" Ryuguichi asked with a light hum.
<br><br>"So you guys are friends of Night Neng and Prince Yi, huh?"
<br><br>Yun mother's eyes lit up and she quickly said with a smile, "I thought you guys were going to inquire about something, it scared me, since they are their friends, then quickly please sit down quickly."
<br><br>After the four of them sat down, Yun mother then said with a smile, "I'm not going to hide it from you guys, just now both Mr. Yi and Night Energy were eating at my place, just left."
<br><br>"Are you very familiar with them?" Liu Gu Yi's gaze moved slightly and asked, "Then I wonder what kind of relationship you have with him?"
<br><br>"I'm not really familiar with him, it's just that Mr. Yi and my daughter are master brothers of the same clan." Yun Mother said with a smile.
<br><br>"Senior brothers?"
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi's four eyes glared.
<br><br>This old woman's daughter in front of them was actually a senior brother with that senior!
<br><br>"Then I wonder, your daughter, which clan is she from?" Liu Gu Yi asked again in a whisper.
<br><br>"It is the Green Bull Sect outside Baier City." Yunmu said softly.
<br><br>"Green Bull Clan?"
<br><br>The four people's eyes glared again, and Li Canghai, who was on the side, couldn't help but ask, "You mean to say that your daughter, and Duke Yi are both from the Green Bull Sect?"
<br><br>"Yes, but from what my daughter said, Duke Yi just entered the Green Bull Sect not long ago, just a few days ago." Yun mother said.
<br><br>Receiving the confirmation from Yun mother, the four people immediately hung their feet and strained their chests.
<br><br>A sharp pain in the heart.
<br><br>Originally this senior was to join their four clans ah!
<br><br>Now it was for nothing a Qingniu clan that was about to close down.
<br><br>Kam ah!
<br><br>The four people's reaction Yun mother did not notice, but remembered the knowledgeable and easy-going Yi Feng, and could not help but say again, "Speaking of ah, this Mr. Yi is really a good man, although he just entered the Qingniu Sect, but to say the least, he is still considered my daughter's half master."
<br><br>"Wow, what does that mean?"
<br><br>The four people asked.
<br><br>"Look there."
<br><br>Yun mother pointed to the painting frame on the wall and the statue placed aside, and said proudly, "This painting and statue were taught to my daughter by Mr. Yi."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The four people were busy to look at them.
<br><br>When they saw the statue and the painting, the four were amazed.
<br><br>Fiercely stood up, staring dead in the eyes, the first time in the eyes showed salivation.
<br><br>The body's cultivation, all in the body can not help but surge up.
<br><br>Just when the atmosphere is tense, Liu Gu Yi ice-cold voice transmission fell in the ears of several people.
<br><br>"Before moving, it is best that you consider the consequences, I remind you to look just, other ideas better have are not!"
<br><br>These words, as if a pot of cold water poured on their heads, and immediately made them dispel their attention.
<br><br>"Forget it, my heart hurts, you ask, I'll go outside and be quiet."
<br><br>Li Canghai turned iron and walked towards the door.
<br><br>"I also have a heartache and want to go outside to blow the cold wind."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong's face was equally suffocatingly ugly.
<br><br>"I also hurt."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian touched his chest, let out a long sigh, and left with remorse.
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi was filled with a bitter smile.
<br><br>Who said that her heart did not hurt.
<br><br>This painting and this statue should have been placed in their four sects!
<br><br>Now it is placed in this secular store, they do not even dare to play attention, you say the heart nest pain?
<br><br>After Liu Gu Yi and Yun Mother inquired some more information, the four people left the small store and gathered again.
<br><br>"Three priorities."
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi said solemnly, "This small store and that old woman's daughter, our four clans have to make extremely good friends, especially that little girl, the future will be a big figure who will be famous in the North Sea."
<br><br>The other three nodded solemnly.
<br><br>They did not have the slightest disagreement in this regard, and any fool would know to do so.
<br><br>"In addition, the Green Bull Clan ......"
<br><br>"Although it hurts to say it, but one has to admit that in the future, the Green Ox Sect will immediately rise in the North Sea and will even surpass our four major sects!" Liu Gu Yi said solemnly again.
<br><br>Several people showed bitter smiles.
<br><br>Although very reluctant, but really have to admit ah.
<br><br>Who told them to be blind in the first place.
<br><br>"The last and most important message is to inform the people of our four clans to control the disciples under their doors, and if a great qi person encounters a senior, make sure to leave a good impression." Liu Gu Yi said solemnly again.
<br><br>"Good, old cloud you draw a portrait of senior, I will now notify the head of the Returning Hall, tell him to take the portrait and inform the four clans." Li Canghai said.
<br><br>After saying that, Li Canghai took out the sound transmission jade slip and notified the person in charge of Gui Yi Hall.
<br><br>Soon, the person in charge swept in.
<br><br>"Greetings to the four great sect masters, I wonder what is the matter that I was called for?" The head of Gui Yi Hall respectfully stood in front of the four.
<br><br>"This is a portrait, take a good look at it."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong took out the portrait of Yi Feng that he had just drawn and handed it to the head of Gui Yi Hall.
<br><br>The person in charge took the portrait and seriously looked at it, then looked up and inquired, "I've seen this person before, I don't know what the four patriarchs are doing by drawing his portrait?"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You've seen it before?"
<br><br>The four people stared at the person in charge with wide eyes and gazed at him in unison.
