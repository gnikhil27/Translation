<br><br>This scene made the injured man next to him look dumbfounded, his throat felt like he had a fish thorn stuck in it, and he couldn't say half a word.
<br><br>This was a black sword.
<br><br>But chasing him for more than 10,000 miles, one foot into the realm of Martial Dignity, but by this little boy a sword than the life of the huge sword to pick away?
<br><br>What the fuck is this divine skill!
<br><br>The Black Sword was almost dumbfounded, and looked at the little boy in front of him with horror.
<br><br>That small body, actually able to burst out such a powerful force, not only will his giant sword shake off, and even let his entire palm bones shattered!
<br><br>But react over.
<br><br>The black sword face then covered with a thick color of shame.
<br><br>For a sword cultivator, there is no greater shame than someone picking the longsword out of his hand.
<br><br>This kind of humiliation. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>When it is not to die.
<br><br>Even if he couldn't see this little boy's cultivation, but full of shame made him desperately want to cut this boy down to the sword!
<br><br>The face flashed a crazy color, the palms of his feet an arrow step along the snow slid to the side of the huge sword, while the palm of his hand fell on the hilt of the sword on the desire to pull out.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>However, just force, his face changed greatly, because just now he actually failed to pull out the huge sword?
<br><br>He did not believe in evil and pulled out the sword again.
<br><br>This time, even the milk of strength are used, but the sword stuck in the ground but still does not move.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>Finally, the black sword heart flooded with shocking waves, eyes are about to glare out.
<br><br>This time.
<br><br>He was finally starting to panic, and for the first time had the idea of retreating.
<br><br>However, he was just about to leave when the little boy, with a reddened little face, suddenly cast an angry glance at him.
<br><br>"You people, how can you be so ungrateful? I told you not to fight and now you want to draw your sword and hit me, I'm very angry now, it seems I have to teach you a lesson."
<br><br>With that, Zhong Qing raised the long sword in his hand and slashed at the black sword.
<br><br>It was a fancy slash without any power, but it made the black sword feel like an enemy, and after a roll, he hastily drew a spare giant sword to block it.
<br><br>"Clang!"
<br><br>A pleasant sound came out, the giant sword in Black Sword's hand broke into two pieces, and the whole person also hit the ground heavily, staring at Zhong Qing with eyes full of fear.
<br><br>"Hurry up and get lost!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing put away his long sword and shouted in a childish tone.
<br><br>Seeing this, the black sword like an amnesty, even that huge sword do not want, climb up and walked into the alley ahead, however, he just wanted to sweep up to fly, but his paws are a fierce meal.
<br><br>At the same time, his eyes were covered with bloodshot, and his body trembled violently.
<br><br>"Knife ......"
<br><br>"Blade Qi, what a powerful blade Qi."
<br><br>Black Sword looked internally at his internal organs and meridians and found that he had long been shattered by a powerful sword qi.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"What the hell is this place?"
<br><br>Holding an unwilling look, the black sword fell straight down into the snow and lost its breath.
<br><br>The wounded man looked at the young boy beside him who had driven the black sword away with two swords with a face full of shock, and was just about to speak when his whole body was violently shocked again.
<br><br>Because he suddenly found that the ground stuck on the huge sword, there is a breath died out.
<br><br>He naturally discerned that the breath was that of the black sword.
<br><br>And as the breath disappeared, that is to say, the black sword was dead.
<br><br>Was he killed by this little boy in front of him?
<br><br>He couldn't help but speculate in his heart.
<br><br>And just in time, Zhong Qing looked at the disappearing figure, then he rubbed his nose and lightly hummed, "For this kind of disobedient person, he has to be taught a good lesson, so that he never has the chance to come to the entrance of my martial arts school and spill his guts again."
<br><br>These words fell on the injured man's ears and instantly made him sure of what he had in mind.
<br><br>It seemed.
<br><br>That unbeatable Black Sword was indeed killed by this little boy with two slashes.
<br><br>Of course, the most shocking thing to him was that he was clearly close to the eyes, but he did not find out what means this little boy used to kill the giant sword.
<br><br>After a moment of shock, he reacted and braced his injured body to stand up and greet.
<br><br>"Little brother ......"
<br><br>"No, senior."
<br><br>Just after opening his mouth, the injured man snapped awake, this seemingly young boy at a young age was not a little brother, but an old monster who had cultivated for an unknown number of years, and hastily changed his tone, "Senior, thank you for saving my life, I am Guan Yunpeng."
<br><br>"Oh, are you all right?" Zhong Qing looked at him and said, "But I'm not any senior, my name is Zhong Qing."
<br><br>"Senior is modest, with senior's heavenly cultivation, it is appropriate for a junior to address you as senior." Guan Yunpeng said respectfully.
<br><br>"Cultivation?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing looked at him again and frowned a little, "You're mistaken, I don't have any cultivation, I'm just a mortal."
<br><br>"A mortal?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng's heart and soul were startled.
<br><br>The expert who killed the black sword with two slashes was a mortal?
<br><br>He didn't believe it even if he was beaten to death.
<br><br>To be able to have such a means, in his opinion, at the very least, he was a Martial Exaltation expert.
<br><br>But this expert insisted that he was a mortal, Guan Yunpeng naturally did not dare to rush.
<br><br>"By the way, how are your injuries, do you want to go in and take a look, my master will look at the injuries." Zhong Qing looked at the injuries on Guan Yunpeng's body and asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Master?"
<br><br>"You, you still have a master?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's words instantly caused Guan Yunpeng's body to jolt and his jaw was about to drop in shock.
<br><br>This one, actually had a master?
<br><br>He himself was at least at the cultivation level of a Martial Exalt, so what cultivation level should his master be?
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>His eyes were filled with disbelief.
<br><br>But Zhong Qing frowned and looked at Guan Yunpeng not too politely and asked back, "You're such a strange person eh, why can't I have a master?"
<br><br>"No, no, no, I don't mean anything, I'm just, I'm just surprised!" Guan Yunpeng hurriedly waved his hands to explain, and only when he saw that Zhong Qing did not look at him with that kind of eyes again, he sent a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Okay then, go in and ask my master to take a look at your injury!" Zhong Qing looked at this strange man, so he took the lead and walked towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng nodded and followed towards the martial arts school with a face full of excitement.
<br><br>But just one step away, his footsteps gave a violent beat.
<br><br>This ......
<br><br>This is?
<br><br>At this moment, his gaze was fixed dead on the pair of couplets at the entrance, and his pupils shrunk to the eye of a needle.
<br><br>Because he found that the script on these two couplets actually contained a powerful sword intent.
<br><br>Especially the vertical one, it was like a heavenly sword descending.
<br><br>With a powerful pressure and a compelling aura, it magnified violently in his eyes, getting closer and closer ......
<br><br>"What are you frothing at?"
<br><br>Just then, Zhong Qing sent out a voice, Guan Yunpeng only suddenly reacted, only to find that his body has been scared out of a cold sweat, his heart can not help but be greatly alarmed.
<br><br>This martial arts school.
<br><br>What in the end is the place?
<br><br>Not only is there a young boy who is so powerful, yet calls himself a mortal, even the couplet posted at the door, the font on it contains such a powerful sword intent.
<br><br>He even felt that if he read all these fonts, he was afraid that he would be able to reach a new height in the Dao of the Sword.
<br><br>He couldn't help but become incomparably excited about the master that the boy inside was talking about.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>The posture also became more respectful.
