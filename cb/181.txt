"What the hell is this?"
<br><br>Under the shock, Lu Dasheng couldn't help but stretch out his finger, rubbed a little on his fingertips, and examined it carefully.
<br><br>Then, could not help but come closer to smell.
<br><br>However, still did not see a reason.
<br><br>Can't help but, head out of the cesspool, looking around a circle, see no one around, his finger couldn't help but come up to the mouth.
<br><br>Then lightning stretched out his tongue.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>And at the moment he stretched out his tongue, the whole person's mind was like a thunderbolt rang out, his eyes were about to stare out.
<br><br>"This is, Pin Pill?"
<br><br>"No, no, it's not a pint medicine."
<br><br>Lu Dasheng shook his head again, the medicinal power in this is obviously lost ninety-nine percent, how can it be a product medicine. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But the next instant he reacted violently.
<br><br>"It seems to be, it seems to be the Pin Pill dregs?"
<br><br>Holding that practice is the only standard to verify the truth, he couldn't help but lick it with the stone again.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Once licked, there was another breath of cold air.
<br><br>This is really the Pin Pill dregs!
<br><br>And such Pin Pill dregs were not just this pile, but the whole cesspit was visible everywhere.
<br><br>Obviously, those violets also grew because of these Pin Pill dregs as nutrients.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>This is not the most shocking thing, what shocked him most was that although the medicinal power of these pills dregs had lost 99%, their effect was still comparable to that of king pills, or even royal pills.
<br><br>In other words, the pills refined by him, the number one pill refiner in Nansha, were only comparable to a piece of shit in this cesspool pool.
<br><br>However, he was not discouraged, instead his eyes were full of fervor, both hands were even grasping full, standing in the cesspool with tears flowing down his eyes in excitement.
<br><br>"No wonder, no wonder Mr. said he would not treat me badly, so it is, so it is."
<br><br>"Keeping the clouds open to see the moon, I Lu Dasheng finally boiled the head ah!"
<br><br>Lu Dasheng tilted his head and cried out in his heart.
<br><br>Even the dregs are not lower than the existence of the King's Pill, he could hardly imagine what kind of grade this would be if it were a finished pill.
<br><br>This cesspool is really too important to him as a pill refiner.
<br><br>The significance to him was even better than if Yi Feng had directly given him a Saint Divine Item.
<br><br>Because with these pill dregs, he was able to harvest a lot of pill refining knowledge from it, giving him a lot of inspiration.
<br><br>With this chance, his achievement in the path of pill refining would definitely not be limited to simply being the number one pill refiner in Southern Sand.
<br><br>"This guy, what is he doing?"
<br><br>In the distance, Yi Feng watched Lu Dasheng pounced into the cesspit, and could not help but frown.
<br><br>Work is quite nimble.
<br><br>But the head does not seem to be very flexible look.
<br><br>Shaking his head, Yi Feng did not care, continued back to the martial arts school, continued to practice calligraphy.
<br><br>After all, he is slightly obsessive-compulsive is also thought, or the first qinqi calligraphy and painting task first completed more comfortable.
<br><br>One hand holds the brush, one hand picks up the spicy bar.
<br><br>Just to eat a mouthful of spicy strips to refresh, remembering the appearance of Lu Dasheng just now, Yi Feng suddenly felt not fragrant, thrown on the ground.
<br><br>Seeing this, the dog came in an arrow step, only a moment, he licked up his tongue.
<br><br>Yi Feng gave him a white look and continued to practice his word painting.
<br><br>......
<br><br>High above the mountain, clouds and fog.
<br><br>In a side pavilion, there was an old Taoist with sword brows sitting on a plate, and in front of him, there was a white-robed youth kneeling.
<br><br>"Master, I only have two spiritual treasures here, my disciple begs you, gift me another spiritual treasure." The white-robed youth said with a pleading face, and in his tone, he even carried a hint of pleading.
<br><br>"Ye Bei ah, you do tell me, what exactly do you want so many spiritual treasures?"
<br><br>The sword-browed old Taoist looked at the disciple under his eyes, frowned and said: "Spiritual treasures are the treasures nurtured by heaven and earth, as long as they are called spiritual treasures, all have their uses, such valuable things you want, you must give me an account, right?"
<br><br>The one kneeling on the ground was none other than Ye Bei.
<br><br>Since that day when he was beaten by that terrifying black robe, he had been scraping around for spiritual treasures, seeing that so much time had passed, but he had only managed to get two spiritual treasures, so he had no choice but to beg his master, Shake Heavenly Que.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Seeing Ye Bei's silence, Old Daoist Tian Que spoke out again in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Master, forgive me for not being able to say anything about this matter." Ye Bei frowned tightly and said with a low head.
<br><br>"Why can't you say anything?" Old Daoist Tian Que asked again.
<br><br>"It's not that I don't want to say it, let alone don't want to say it, but ......"
<br><br>Ye Bei showed a difficult look, he knew his master not only hot-tempered, but also loves himself to the extreme, and even this all cultivation are taught by him, if you know that you because of the black-robed man's threat and so, this Tian Que old dao is bound to regardless of the cause, even regardless of what the opposite is, on the sword to kill the door for him to get justice.
<br><br>But really kill the door, will be the black-robed man's opponent?
<br><br>Not to mention, there is that even more imperceptible youth?
<br><br>He didn't want to see his master die a tragic death in the martial arts school, so he then gritted his teeth and said, "Master redeems himself, I'm not telling, it's really for your own good."
<br><br>"For my own good?"
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que's tone sank, "For my own good you won't tell me?"
<br><br>"Please Master atone, I really can't say." Ye Bei said stiffly.
<br><br>"Fine, fine."
<br><br>"You really have hardened your wings!" Shaking Heavenly Que slowly stood up, and the mighty pressure of Martial Sect Perfection was released from his body and pressed towards Ye Bei.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>Ye Bei's stone slab shattered under his feet and was under great pressure, but he still clenched his teeth and said, "Master, it's better to stop asking, I really can't tell."
<br><br>"Still not saying?"
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que waved his palm, Yuan Qi enveloped out, throwing Ye Bei behind the rock and hitting it heavily.
<br><br>Then pressed forward again, coldly said: "If you still do not say, I will abolish your cultivation, my master and disciple to clear the relationship, as for the innate spiritual treasure, you do not want to take."
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, Yuan Qi surged in Shaking Heavenly Que's hand.
<br><br>"Master why do you have to force me like this?" Ye Bei said with a difficult face.
<br><br>Shaking Heavenly Que still had a cold face, and when he saw that Ye Bei still didn't say anything, he turned and dropped his palm to his brow.
<br><br>How could he not see that Ye Bei was touching things?
<br><br>If you do not use this method, how can you force Ye Bei to say.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Seeing the situation Ye Bei's face immediately anxious, busy shouted, "I say."
<br><br>Seeing this, shaking the sky Que then slowly put down his arm, staring closely at Ye Bei.
<br><br>"Can listen to the end, master you must be calm, and this matter is really because of me, it is my fault in the first place, and they are monstrous strength, even master can not deal with!" Ye Bei hurriedly reminded.
<br><br>Then, only then, he told all the things that happened before and after the martial school, as well as the incident of the black-robed man that followed.
<br><br>However, as soon as he said it, looking at Shaking Heavenly Que's face, he secretly said it was over.
<br><br>Sure enough, Shaking Heavenly Que instantly became furious.
<br><br>"How dare you."
<br><br>"Follow me to cut him down."
<br><br>With a stunning killing intent enveloping him, a flying sword flew out for no reason, floating in the air, and Shaking Heavenly Que stepped on it, while a hand grabbed Ye Bei and flew towards the mountain.
