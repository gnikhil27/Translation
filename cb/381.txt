Not even just nobody, not even a few things on the island, could be seen.
<br><br>He was filled with bewilderment.
<br><br>And also full of confusion.
<br><br>It also made him and its difficult!
<br><br>Swear to get another divine soul over, want to figure out Yi Feng and other people's identity strength at once, but found that there is not a hair on the island.
<br><br>This is like holding back the power, but a fist hit the cotton.
<br><br>Another uncomfortable is that the soul because there is no body, and is not a consciousness class, so even if the strength of the strong, also afraid of the wind and rain.
<br><br>At the moment it is raining, and it is still getting bigger and bigger, along with the whistling wind, is to Su Xuanjun scraping body straight shiver.
<br><br>This feeling is like minus 30 degrees in winter, bare ingots in the frozen lake naked, that kind of bone-chilling cold is really difficult to describe in words.
<br><br>At the same time, this uncomfortable feeling, but also directly to the immortal world of Su Xuanjun body.
<br><br>The most damned irritating is that this island is not even a shelter from the rain, only to let Su Xuanjun light freezing. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Hold on."
<br><br>"This little pain is nothing."
<br><br>"Besides, it doesn't matter if they're not there for a while, after all, my divine soul body can last for a whole day, I just don't believe that I can't wait for them back for a day."
<br><br>After saying that, he gritted his teeth and found a place to squat down.
<br><br>After saying that, he could not help but shiver.
<br><br>East Victory Continent.
<br><br>Tianwu Square.
<br><br>This square was a gathering place built by the clans of East Victory back in the day, basically East Victory had big things, clan exchange meetings, and so on other matters will be held here.
<br><br>And at this moment in the sky martial square, divided into seven or eight camps standing dozens of people. These seven or eight camps of people, all representing the seven or eight top powers of the Eastern Victory Continent.
<br><br>As they waited, they exchanged words.
<br><br>"How come this great clan of the Central Continent suddenly wants to run to my Eastern Victory?"
<br><br>"Yeah, it's really puzzling, and they even gave notice in advance to come over and let us meet them, and I don't know what exactly is going on."
<br><br>"Who knows, wait in peace, we will know when they come."
<br><br>"Yes, after all, it is a big sect of the Central Continent, even if they are not familiar, they can not be neglected, after all, the power of the Central Continent, but really not our East Sheng can provoke."
<br><br>In the midst of their exchange of waiting, a huge aura came violently from outside the sky.
<br><br>"Here it comes."
<br><br>The greeting crowd lifted their heads.
<br><br>Then they saw that seven men in green clothes flew towards this way as seven streams of light, and then landed in front of the crowd.
<br><br>"Greetings to the Midcontinent seniors."
<br><br>Seeing these seven men, the delegates greeted by East Victory bowed, and their eyes were filled with scorn.
<br><br>It had to be said that the experts coming from this middle continent were indeed strong!
<br><br>The six men at the back at least have Martial Emperor eight or nine lives not to mention that the man at the head of the group was completely unreadable to them.
<br><br>The man at the head of the Chinese continent nodded expressionlessly, and then dropped his gaze to the body of these representatives of the Eastern Victory.
<br><br>The face, couldn't help but sink.
<br><br>"Are the people of your Eastern Victory Continent that weak?"
<br><br>"The ones who greeted us were actually a bunch of Martial Saints, and the strongest one was a Second Life Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>"Where is your Patriarch?"
<br><br>An invisible pressure acted on the crowd, and a heavy voice came from the man in green at the head.
<br><br>The East Victory crowd immediately touched a sweat, lowered their heads and stammered, "Senior sorry, our patriarch disappeared and disappeared some time ago, so, so ......"
<br><br>"Yes, yes, our patriarch is also, said to go out two days to return, but this is almost a month has not seen back."
<br><br>"Yes, our patriarch is also."
<br><br>"The patriarch is not here, then the elders are always here, right?" The man in green again sulked out, "Is it hard to say that you are the elders? But in a large sect in a continent, the elders should at least be Sixth Life Martial Emperors, right?"
<br><br>"This, we are indeed not elders."
<br><br>"To be honest, our elders ...... have also disappeared."
<br><br>"Yes, our elders have also disappeared."
<br><br>One by one, voices came out with their heads lowered.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"What a bunch of nonsense."
<br><br>The man in charge was instantly furious.
<br><br>"One clan and two clans are missing, but all of your clan's patriarchs and elders are missing en masse, are you playing with me?"
<br><br>"Are you not looking down on me?"
<br><br>A heavy voice came out, and the mighty pressure pressed the crowd unable to lift their heads.
<br><br>But the crowd of the Eastern Victory Continent wanted to cry without tears.
<br><br>They really did not lie, the sect leader and elders inside the sect really went out and did not hear from them.
<br><br>They are also anxious about this matter, do not know how to do it.
<br><br>PS: Continue to code words.
