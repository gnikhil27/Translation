"Ow, shit, shit."
<br><br>In the dark.
<br><br>As the beads were gouged off, a howl of heartache came out of his mouth.
<br><br>Although these two beads were not his real eyes, but were inlaid on the wall with a special material, and subsequently attached two traces of his divine soul to them for easy observation.
<br><br>But as Yi Feng gouged the beads off, it was equivalent to erasing the wisp of his soul attached to it.
<br><br>This added to his already dead state.
<br><br>But what he didn't expect was that this damn white-robed man didn't know enough after picking off one, and actually came back to pick another one with a serious face.
<br><br>Seeing this scene.
<br><br>He hated the white-robed man in front of him.
<br><br>Can only stare, watching the palm of that hand bigger and bigger.
<br><br>With that. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Gouged it down.
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"Damn human, lowly human, I said you a fairy board."
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"What the hell is going on ah, this wall I clearly placed a taboo before I was born, not to mention the human being suppressed by the descending dimension, even the strongest person under the immortal could not see through my taboo, how in the end did he see through it?"
<br><br>"It's so pretty!"
<br><br>Yi Feng placed the two beads on the palm of his hand and looked at them carefully.
<br><br>"Such a good-looking bead, I'm afraid it's able to sell for ten gold coins a piece."
<br><br>"What an unexpected surprise."
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng carefully put the two beads away.
<br><br>A face of satisfaction.
<br><br>After all, one bead is ten gold coins, two beads is twenty gold coins, which translates to two hundred thousand beef noodles.
<br><br>A mosquito's leg is meat even if it's small!
<br><br>What Yi Feng did not know was that above his head, a shadow suddenly appeared.
<br><br>He had a hideous face.
<br><br>Eyes flashing with the fire of hatred, staring deadly at Yi Feng.
<br><br>However, when he heard Yi Feng say that the bead could be sold for ten gold coins, the shadow almost spit out a mouthful of old blood.
<br><br>What ten gold coins ah.
<br><br>The value of that pair of beads, even if the entire Nansha sold is not enough, okay?
<br><br>How dare you devalue his pair of treasures like this, so angry!
<br><br>"Lowly lower level human, I don't care what you are, or how you ignored the formation I set up, but now you, only with your life to pay for the mistake you made!"
<br><br>The shadow stared at Yi Feng with a deadly gaze.
<br><br>Then it stretched out its sharp claws and transformed into a huge shadow and lunged towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye.
<br><br>It had arrived behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>The killing machine was revealed.
<br><br>For all this, Yi Feng was oblivious to the sharp claw marks, which were about to touch his neck instantly.
<br><br>"Bounce ......"
<br><br>Just then, along with a strange sound, a breath spurted out directly from behind Yi Feng.
<br><br>The shadow that attacked Yi Feng just happened to touch this breath and lunged towards him head-on.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>In the nothingness, he let out an inaudible scream, and his whole person was rushed by this breath, and almost became unshaped, so that he could no longer maintain his condensed form at this moment.
<br><br>And his whole shadow, compared to before, also do not know how much weaker.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Damn in the cave wild radish eaten too much, long held a stomach of gas, finally considered to be expelled."
<br><br>Yi Feng took a breath.
<br><br>Both hands pressed, a face of relief.
<br><br>"Ah, ah ah!"
<br><br>"How could this happen."
<br><br>However, the shadow shrinking inside the corner heard Yi Feng's words, and his mouth roared out madly, with a face of doubt about life.
<br><br>After his death, he had been laying out in order to be able to resurrect, while also trying his best to retain his few divine soul powers.
<br><br>In order to reduce the soul power in the river of time, so the soul state he has been hidden in the dark, even at great cost to make the pair of eyes is also to reduce the use of the mind, so as not to cause the soul excessive dissipation.
<br><br>But what he did not expect was that his carefully preserved divine soul was instantly blown away by that force just now, making most of his body transparent and full of weakness.
<br><br>The most infuriating thing was that it was actually a fucking fart!
<br><br>"I don't care what you are, I want you to die, die!"
<br><br>He roared with hatred.
<br><br>The eyes were flickering with a thick fire.
<br><br>With a movement of his palm, a small black snake appeared out of thin air on the floor, spitting out its snake's letter, giving a compelling and eerie feeling.
<br><br>"Black Kui, kill this human for me, but don't destroy his body, leave it to me to take over."
<br><br>The shadow commanded in a deep voice.
<br><br>The black snake spat out its snake's letter and slowly crawled towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Seeing Black Kui's movement, the Void Shadow was filled with a cold smile.
<br><br>Although he didn't know what had gone wrong with his descending dimensional suppression that caused this person to repeatedly overtake his control, he didn't panic.
<br><br>Because Black Kui was not an ordinary snake, but a snake that he had brought down from the Immortal World during his lifetime.
<br><br>As the name implies.
<br><br>It was an immortal level demonic beast.
<br><br>Although it might be weakened in the Immortal River Continent because of the laws, it was definitely an invincible existence in the Immortal River Continent as well.
<br><br>Black Kui made a move.
<br><br>This human simply can not have a way to live.
<br><br>And at the time of his death, it is also a good time to take over the body itself.
<br><br>At that time, by a fart disintegration of the power of the soul, also simply does not matter.
<br><br>And he.
<br><br>Will be newborn, reappear on the continent, will be the whole continent trampled under the feet.
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>The smugness in the shadow's heart grew.
<br><br>Because all of this.
<br><br>It was seamless.
<br><br>There will be no surprises.
<br><br>And Black Kui also slowly approached without Yi Feng's knowledge, spitting snake letters.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Its body bowed slightly, fiercely popped up and swept out.
<br><br>In mid-air, it opened its pouring mouth and locked directly onto Yi Feng's neck.
<br><br>"It's done."
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the shadow's heart fiercely rejoiced.
<br><br>Because under such an attack from Black Kui, no one in the entire Immortal River Continent could dodge.
