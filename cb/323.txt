The shadow had a smug face.
<br><br>It rushed to the door as a stream of light, but it met Yi Feng who was walking in front of it.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>This face is ......
<br><br>When the face was in his eyes, the bigger it was released, he was shaken.
<br><br>"It's him!"
<br><br>At this moment, the smug look on his face instantly froze, and then it was worse than dead mother.
<br><br>"My grandfather."
<br><br>"Master, ancestor."
<br><br>"Why are you back again."
<br><br>"Please, don't screw me like this!" Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I'm really just a small immortal ah, Hunting Heaven Tablet also gave you, black kyu also eaten by you, what else do you want, old man!"
<br><br>If it were not for the state of the divine soul, at this moment his eyes are about to fall down with tears.
<br><br>So he charged forward and instantly made a 180 degree turn in mid-air.
<br><br>This frame.
<br><br>It is called the flow of water, not the slightest delay.
<br><br>Then shrunk to a certain corner inside, not daring to move.
<br><br>"This big hall."
<br><br>"It can't be the core of the immortal ruins, right?"
<br><br>Walking into this big hall, Lone Wunian and Yun Yoyo carefully looked around.
<br><br>However, they observed a circle, but found that there was nothing in this big hall.
<br><br>"It shouldn't be any core you guys are talking about, otherwise this is a bit too chilly, right?" Yi Feng couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>Lone Wunian two people also nodded their heads.
<br><br>But when he heard this, Void almost cried out.
<br><br>My master.
<br><br>This entire hall, the immortal beast that guarded the town was eaten by you.
<br><br>The most powerful immortal weapon, the Hunting Heaven Tablet, is held in your hand.
<br><br>Even the most valuable pair of beads, you also picked away.
<br><br>In turn, you say I'm chilling here?
<br><br>Grand Master.
<br><br>What the hell are you up to!
<br><br>"Forget about that, forget about that, it's better to find a way out as soon as possible."
<br><br>Yi Feng instructed toward the two, then a passage a passage to look at, but also in the survey of the hall around whether there is any organs.
<br><br>"Crap, the way out?"
<br><br>The void in the corner was stunned.
<br><br>Your old man does not know the way out? You just a way to get out?
<br><br>Even if you want to pretend to eat a tiger in front of two juniors, it's not the way to eat it, so don't take me with you!
<br><br>"Please."
<br><br>"You go."
<br><br>"I'll send you out, it's okay!"
<br><br>The shadow trembled and shuddered, and with a movement of the mind, the whole hall suddenly emitted a trembling sound.
<br><br>Then it was heard that inside the entire underground, countless stone doors were moving.
<br><br>Then, under the gaze of Yi Feng and the others, the countless passageways linking the great hall closed, leaving only the last passageway across in front of the three Yi Feng.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly walked to the mouth of the passage, raised his palm to feel it carefully and said excitedly, "There is a faint wind, it should be the exit."
<br><br>At that, the other two also showed their excitement.
<br><br>"Then let's hurry up and go?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The three all had a hopeful glint in their eyes, and then carefully stepped in towards the cave.
<br><br>Seeing that Yi Feng and the three of them had left, the void cowering inside the corner finally let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>But he had just taken a breath when he heard another long voice coming out of that passage.
<br><br>"You two go first, I'll turn back halfway and come right back."
<br><br>Yi Feng said towards the two Yun Yoyo, and then walked back towards the main hall.
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Void Shadow's heart once again rose to his throat.
<br><br>He was back again.
<br><br>What is he going to do?
<br><br>Is he going to finish me off before he leaves?
<br><br>Just as he was thinking this ......
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>A bubble of urine nourished down, making the vain shadow's body jolt.
<br><br>Ugh ......
<br><br>Too bullying.
<br><br>Plum opening two degrees.
<br><br>I can't believe it's the second time in a row!
<br><br>"Hold it for a long time."
<br><br>Yi Feng muttered.
<br><br>Before Yun Yaoyao was in, it was really inconvenient, this time out, it was too good.
<br><br>After spilling hit a shake, Yi Feng only to lift the waistband of his pants to go.
<br><br>A line of three.
<br><br>Continue to hurry.
<br><br>Right now there is only one passage left, even if deep inside, no longer become four-way, plus the occasional feeling of a subtle wind, so that everyone knows that this road is bound to get out of this immortal ruins.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>This bottom passage is too wide, even if you find the way, it is not known also walk to the monkey.
<br><br>In addition, a long time ago the crowd has been exhausted, so the lack of replenishment of the lonely Wu Nian and Yun Yoyao finally can not walk.
<br><br>Directly fell to the ground.
<br><br>Dying.
<br><br>"Don't fall down, you'll be able to get out soon."
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up the two and fed them a sip of water, while saying comfortingly.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, I really can't hold on anymore."
<br><br>Lone Wunian's face was pale and his voice was weak as he said.
<br><br>"I can't hold on anymore either."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was also weak on the ground, without a trace of blood on her face.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Your cultivator's physique is too poor, without your cultivation it's nothing!"
<br><br>Looking at the two, Yi Feng couldn't help but spit out.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made the two people's faces draw animals.
<br><br>It is obvious that your mortal physique is too perverted, okay, and even made them wonder if Yi Feng is actually a super expert who is more powerful than them?
<br><br>Only now in this state, they were too lazy to explore this.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>After looking at the two, he said helplessly, "Actually, I still have a piece of beef jerky here."
<br><br>"Crap?"
<br><br>Lone Wunian, who was just about to die, didn't know where he got the strength to exclaim violently.
<br><br>And Yun Yaoyao also turned her incredulous gaze to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Eat it!"
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng evenly tore it into three halves and shared it with them.
<br><br>The two people took it and wolfed it down.
<br><br>After eating both of them looked much better.
<br><br>"Brother Yi, you still have beef jerky, why didn't you take it out earlier?" Lone Wunian couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao also looked over.
<br><br>"If I had taken it out earlier, these beef jerky would have been eaten long ago, would we have lasted until now?" Yi Feng asked rhetorically.
<br><br>"Awesome."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Lone Wunian couldn't help but give a thumbs up.
<br><br>Under the extreme hunger situation, Yi Feng actually hid it.
<br><br>If it were himself, he asked himself that he couldn't do what Yi Feng did.
<br><br>I'm afraid that early to take out the beef jerky to eat, but at the same time also represents, they simply can not hold on to here.
<br><br>And Yun Yaoyao is also looking at Yi Feng meaningfully.
<br><br>This!
<br><br>Really a treasure man ah!
<br><br>Always will let people out of expectation.
<br><br>Looking back on this journey, Yi Feng always gave them new hope when they were desperate and couldn't hold on.
<br><br>"Eat and drink enough, continue on the road, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>Then he took the lead and walked towards the front.
<br><br>"Miss Yun, I'm ten thousand times glad that I chose before." Lone Wunian said with a lucky face.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"I'm also very fortunate."
<br><br>Looking at the white-robed figure in front of her, Yun Yaoyao murmured softly.
<br><br>For a while, he looked out of breath.
<br><br>What a remarkable mortal!
<br><br>It was this back figure that saved her life many times, and it was this back figure that brought her hope of life many times.
<br><br>It was this back that made her, who was a Martial Emperor, feel what it was like to rely for the first time.
<br><br>This is gone, and two days.
<br><br>"Help ......"
<br><br>"Help ......"
<br><br>Just then, a faint cry for help came from ahead.
<br><br>The three of them hurriedly went up to check, and immediately found two people lying on the ground dying, it was the two old men of Yin and Yang who had been separated for most of the month.
<br><br>Although they do not know how they got here, but at this moment they have long been starved skin and bones, their faces are white.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng three, the two desperately struggled up and stretched up their palms and said, "Save, save us."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao and Lone Wunian were indifferent and turned their inquiring eyes to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>Nowadays, they all took Yi Feng as their leader.
<br><br>"Kid, hurry up and save us."
<br><br>Seeing Yun Yoyao and Lone Wunian's indifference, the Yin Yang twin elders looked at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Who am I to save you guys?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked back with a black face.
<br><br>He hadn't forgotten what kind of attitude these two old men had towards him before.
<br><br>"We are cultivators from the Middle Continent, if you don't save us, when we get out, we will definitely bruise you to the ground."
<br><br>The two men transmitted threatening sounds directly towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>They expected that Yi Feng was a mortal and would definitely be afraid of them as cultivators.
<br><br>"Haha."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng, however, laughed directly.
<br><br>Stretching out his palm, he felt it slightly and murmured, "This place is getting closer to the exit, and I don't need to continue saving, so let's all have a good meal!"
<br><br>Said, Yi Feng took out three pieces of beef jerky at once.
<br><br>"Crap you ......"
<br><br>Lone Wunian was stunned.
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao was also full of dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Eat, have a good meal, then go home happily." Yi Feng said with a smile, and then took a big bite.
<br><br>Then without even looking at the two old men, he just left.
<br><br>This scene, looking at the yin and Yang double old man two body straight twitch, drool are dripping down, trembling body, full of prayerful face looking at Yun Yaoyao and Lone Wunian.
<br><br>Obviously praying for them to give a mouthful of food.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"Want to eat?"
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>Lone Wunian raised his eyebrows at the two, and while tearing the beef with his mouth, he hurriedly followed Yi Feng.
<br><br>At the same time, he also did not forget to touch his mouth full of oil, living and breathing angry.
<br><br>"Blame yourself."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao also coldly glanced at the two old men, directly crossed from them, towards Yi Feng to follow ......
