"Mmm!"
<br><br>The old man nodded his head solemnly.
<br><br>Hearing the old man's confirmation, the Heaven Devouring Emperor was dumbfounded.
<br><br>That most incompetent son of his was actually able to become the savior of his Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan?
<br><br>He couldn't believe it no matter how he thought about it.
<br><br>For a while, he looked at this old man who had been in seclusion for hundreds of years, and the more he looked like a godly man, he also directly lied to the top of his Heaven Devouring Emperor's head, which simply made him unstoppable with anger.
<br><br>"Put your mother's fart, you old thing full of nonsense."
<br><br>A loud cuss, followed by a slap on the old man's bald head, knocking the old man to the ground.
<br><br>"Heaven Devouring Emperor, what are you doing?"
<br><br>The old man trembled and fell to the ground, looking at the Devouring Emperor angrily.
<br><br>"What else, you old godly man has cheated on me, why are you asking me?" The Heaven Devouring Emperor stepped on the old man's back and said disdainfully, "You said you were going to fool me, think of a better way to say it, the entire Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf clan knows that this third son of mine, Ao Qing, is the most untalented, yet you say he is the savior of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf, do you take me for a fool?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"You ...... you are confused!"
<br><br>The old man lying on the ground shouted with hatred, "I really did not lie to you!"
<br><br>"Still tough-mouthed?"
<br><br>The Devouring Emperor added another kick and said soberly: "Yes, my third son was screwing Ao Qingcheng and ruining the Red Sun lineage's plot, but this situation today is not something he can solve with a single gun, I really thought you had some divination ability, but now it seems that you are no different from my dim-witted old father, both fucking gods! "
<br><br>"You you you ...... you don't believe me, you will harm the entire royal family lineage, you will become a sinner of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf lineage." The old man angrily pointed at the Heaven Devouring Emperor and drank.
<br><br>"Humph, old thing, if this emperor really believes in your evil, only then will he really harm the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf lineage!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor added another kick, then waved his hand and shouted, "Someone, drag him down to me and put him in the big prison."
<br><br>The old man trembled and drank angrily with a red face, "Heaven Devouring Emperor, one day, you will come back to me to apologize, you will regret it!"
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Emperor snorted and sat down again to contemplate the big event.
<br><br>"Lord Wolf Emperor, Elder Jin's words must not be disbelieved!" At this time, the old butler accompanying the Heaven Devouring Emperor came and said, "Why don't we call the Third Prince back?"
<br><br>"Humph, what's so credible about that old thing's words?" The Heaven Devouring Emperor huffed.
<br><br>The old man sighed and said again: "Even if you don't believe me, I think it's necessary to call the Third Prince back, after all, this is his home, and now that there is such a big event, he can't just stand by and watch!
<br><br>"All right, all right, let's leave this matter to you!"
<br><br>The Devouring Emperor impatiently waved his hand, not even caring what the old butler was saying, his thoughts were immersed in the current civil war, struggling to think of countermeasures.
<br><br>The old butler smiled, nodded, and only then slowly retreated.
<br><br>Martial Hall.
<br><br>Yi Feng held a brush in his hand, looking at the words on the rice paper, rather proudly nodding his head.
<br><br>As for the guitar that he was holding before, it has been some days since he picked it up.
<br><br>Because the piano art after drinking that day, directly rushed to compare with God, this unexpected joy also let Yi Feng accumulate an experience, in addition to change various styles to practice, that mood is the key to improve.
<br><br>So, Yi Feng at the moment when practicing calligraphy, almost all the various fonts of his previous life, progress is also really a lot of divine effect.
<br><br>But the mood of that kind of thing can not be found, Yi Feng also do not have too much way.
<br><br>But Yi Feng is not in a hurry, after all, the four items of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting is already two to reach with God, only two remaining calligraphy and chess is a good solution, after all, because of the previous accumulation, the original has been to a very deep realm.
<br><br>"Ding, system new task."
<br><br>"Will cookery, wine, tea, carving, improve to the realm of comparison with God."
<br><br>"Mission reward: can obtain a halo!"
<br><br>"Penalty for failure: take back the martial arts school!"
<br><br>Again?
<br><br>Hearing the voice in his head, Yi Feng's face instantly sank.
<br><br>This broken system is really not idle, this is the fucking rhythm that wants him to learn all kinds of messy skills all over again!
<br><br>But the mission reward "halo", but attracted his attention.
<br><br>"What exactly is this halo?"
<br><br>"What exactly does it do?"
<br><br>Yi Feng scratched his head and frowned.
<br><br>Since the first shade, after saying that it was rewarding him with a supreme expert but getting a broken skull, he had a rejection of this system and didn't even have the slightest expectation for that whatsoever mount.
<br><br>But this time the halo, sounds like a different much!
<br><br>It was actually giving him a renewed sense of anticipation.
<br><br>"Check the progress."
<br><br>"Culinary Arts: Back to the basics."
<br><br>"Wine art: a small success."
<br><br>"Tea art: perfection."
<br><br>"Carving: a blank."
<br><br>After reading these proficiencies, Yi Feng nodded, it seemed that this proficiency was the same as before, as long as he had done it before, he would be able to accumulate it and directly have the corresponding proficiency.
<br><br>"Then it seems that I'll have to cook every day from now on."
<br><br>"I just don't know, that rewarding aura, what exactly is it, we'll see!"
