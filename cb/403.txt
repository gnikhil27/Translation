Looking at a super large bronze altar in front of him, Yi Feng couldn't help but be amazed.
<br><br>With a curious mind, Yi Feng quickly rushed over.
<br><br>Just step on the altar, Yi Feng seems to have passed through a layer of something, but he did not care, but casually surveyed up.
<br><br>Around the altar, eight huge pillars were erected, and the pillars were carved with all kinds of strange patterns, which was daunting to see.
<br><br>This pattern Yi Feng also can not read, and did not look, the gaze turned to the ground.
<br><br>Then saw in the altar in the middle of the place, painted with a circular pattern, the pattern seems to be some kind of totem.
<br><br>And in the middle of the pattern, there is a brick-sized button.
<br><br>"What is this thing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng subconsciously stepped on a foot, the button immediately sank, and in its place was a dark compartment.
<br><br>And in the middle of the dark compartment, there was an ancient wooden box.
<br><br>"Oh?" The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Could it be that I have found a treasure?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was so excited that he directly opened the box.
<br><br>Roar!
<br><br>With an invisible hiss, a snow-white monster rushed out of the box along with a layer of white mist.
<br><br>"Witch-demon divine object, how dare a humanran point!?"
<br><br>At that moment, it opened its pouring mouth and tore towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>In the space behind Yi Feng, it directly turned into a black hole.
<br><br>The monster was a witch-demon treasure-protecting divine beast, and even though it was only a soul body, it was also monstrously strong.
<br><br>"Ahem!"
<br><br>"What a big ash."
<br><br>Yi Feng squinted his eyes and coughed twice and couldn't help but incline his head while waving his hand towards the box.
<br><br>At the moment Yi Feng waved his hand, the treasure protector divine beast stared in disbelief.
<br><br>"The body, actually ......"
<br><br>Before the words fell, it directly turned into a green smoke and disappeared.
<br><br>Witch-demon divine beast.
<br><br>Pawn!
<br><br>A long time later, Yi Feng only saw his eyes in the box.
<br><br>In the box, there was a blood-red bead, the size of a goose egg, full of a demonic beauty.
<br><br>"What kind of bead is this?"
<br><br>Yi Feng picked it up and knocked it, observed and observed it, and was immediately disappointed.
<br><br>"Thought it was something good, but it turns out to be just a broken bead, except for looking good seems to be of no use whatsoever."
<br><br>Yi Feng skimmed his mouth.
<br><br>"But yes, who would put something good in such a shitty place."
<br><br>But having said that, he still casually put the beads away.
<br><br>Just as he was about to get up, he felt a sharp pain in his stomach.
<br><br>"Rub."
<br><br>"My stomach hurts, I have to shit."
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was blue, holding his stomach and ready to find a place to shit, but in a hurry, and could not find a good place for a while.
<br><br>As for the solution anywhere is not bad, after all, there is no one around.
<br><br>But you have to find a pit, right?
<br><br>No pit for Yi Feng can not, because he has a shadow.
<br><br>After all, he can not forget one time into the mountains, is also a stomachache did not find a pit, in place to solve, but eat too much, piled up a mountain too high, resulting in the pouting buttocks a little lower on the rub.
<br><br>That time, he walked two miles with his buttocks arched hard to find a water source to wash clean.
<br><br>Since then, Yi Feng swore that there must be a pit to take a shit.
<br><br>"What a rush."
<br><br>Yi Feng was ready to go to the pit, but just two steps his body stiffened and found that he could not move, and then move to hold it.
<br><br>Just when he did not know what to do, he suddenly looked to the side of the dark compartment, his eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>This dark compartment is just two hands wide, can be perfect for ah.
<br><br>Although the box is still placed in the dark compartment, but also do not care so much, without saying a word, stepping on the small steps moved to the dark compartment, towards the box a diarrhea.
<br><br>Soon after, Yi Feng's face re-filled with a confident smile, casually picking with a stick, the box closed again.
<br><br>Comfortably put on the pants, but suddenly found the waist empty.
<br><br>And touched, the face suddenly changed.
<br><br>"Damn, where is the old man's money bag?"
<br><br>He repeatedly touched his body, and still did not find the money bag.
<br><br>"Kam ah!"
<br><br>"Just lost one some time ago, and again, God do not want to play me so ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng broke out in curses, while recalling where the money bag might have fallen.
<br><br>"Huh, it seems to have fallen at Miss White's place, I took a shower at her place, yes, it must be ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng finally remembered where the money bag went.
<br><br>But remembering that he had been away for a day, Yi Feng hesitated again.
<br><br>How to do it.
<br><br>Or turn around and get it?
<br><br>But also can not ah, white Piao Piao he believes will pick up the gold, but the other few garbage it.
<br><br>If they pick it up, it is not a meat bag to beat the dog there is no return?
<br><br>Once I thought of this, Yi Feng no longer hesitate, jumped on the back slowly, turned around and rushed towards Bai Piao Piao's residence.
<br><br>Another day passed, and Yi Feng finally came back to the foot of Bai Piao Piao's mountain.
<br><br>Put away slowly, Yi Feng lifted his steps up the mountain.
<br><br>And a few people on the mountain, in the past two days of busy, the face finally showed a smile of satisfaction.
<br><br>"Miss Bai, the formation is rearranged."
<br><br>Yun Lan came in front of Bai Piao Piao and said, "For the next time, Miss Bai just needs to stay here in seclusion at ease until she awakens."
<br><br>Bai Piao Piao's beautiful eyes opened and looked at him.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yun Lan seemed to be afraid that Bai Piao Piao was not at ease and said proudly, "Miss Bai, don't worry, I personally set up this formation, there will never be a problem like last time, unless it is an immortal from heaven, it is impossible to find us here."
