"Stupid human, looking for death!"
<br><br>When the three great demon immortals saw this, they revealed their disdainful voices.
<br><br>In their opinion, this human mortal without cultivation really does not know the sky is high, actually hunting to their head.
<br><br>Three arrows sharpened from tree branches and not broken at will?
<br><br>"Crush it!"
<br><br>One of the demon immortals opened his mouth slightly, and a breath enveloped towards the three arrows.
<br><br>But the next moment, his face suddenly changed.
<br><br>The breath exhaled from his Demon Immortal strength actually did not affect the three arrows in the slightest.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The remaining two also noticed the strange situation and were a little incredulous.
<br><br>This kind of thing is really too fantastic, the breath of the Demon Immortal strength, not to mention the three branches, even the Martial Emperor cultivation experts can directly suppress. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>See the arrows are getting closer and closer, so the three subconsciously dodge towards the side.
<br><br>But this does not dodge okay, a dodge three demon immortals instantly more incredible.
<br><br>Because these three crooked branches, actually completely locked them.
<br><br>Can't dodge.
<br><br>How can?
<br><br>How is it possible?
<br><br>But the three did not panic.
<br><br>Although did not understand what exactly the situation, but three branches, but also simply not a threat to them, may not even be able to break their defense.
<br><br>Because today's cultivation realm, so they have this enough bottom.
<br><br>Even without doubt, now the entire Immortal River continent in addition to those who have also become immortal characters, other things that can hurt them are not.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Three arrows, each landed on their bodies.
<br><br>But the arrows, which were thought to be unable to break the defense and could not cause them the slightest harm at all, once again surpassed their expectation.
<br><br>They pierced through their hard shell and pierced into the flesh.
<br><br>One, an arrow in the buttocks.
<br><br>Another, an arrow in the shoulder.
<br><br>Finally, the one-horned man at the head was the most miserable, the arrow almost grazed his little old brother and stuck in the root of his thigh.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>Three angry roars were immediately heard throughout the mountain forest.
<br><br>It was deafening.
<br><br>At once, birds and beasts flew, and all beasts submitted.
<br><br>Three demon immortals who were about to step into the immortal realm were actually defended by an arrow shot by a mortal, how could they endure this?
<br><br>Regardless of what caused all this accident, they must make this mortal suffer the price he deserves.
<br><br>However, what they did not expect was that, in the face of their angry roar, this mortal actually did not have the slightest fear, but on the contrary, his face also overflowed with a strong smile.
<br><br>Yes.
<br><br>Just a smile.
<br><br>While smiling, he also trotted over and excitedly passed out his voice.
<br><br>"Yah!"
<br><br>"This roar, enough brash, proper, I like it."
<br><br>Once Yi Feng's words came out, it completely enraged the three great demon immortals completely.
<br><br>Mockery.
<br><br>It was really mockery.
<br><br>"Tear it into pieces."
<br><br>"This human must be torn into pieces."
<br><br>The three demons' hearts rose with thick anger, about to open their huge mouths and tear Yi Feng into pieces.
<br><br>But suddenly they found that their bodies were weak and their nerves were paralyzed.
<br><br>A body of heavenly cultivation at this moment also completely lost control, can not exert a half.
<br><br>Until finally, even the strength to stand still, straight down on the ground.
<br><br>The three demons were horrified in their hearts.
<br><br>What they encountered today was too evil for them.
<br><br>The bow and arrow shot by a mortal made them unable to dodge, and even directly broke their defense, and also made them lose their mobility completely.
<br><br>This simply defies common sense ......
<br><br>Just when they were shocked, they saw that the person who caused all this was walking towards them with a smile on his face, looking at them from above.
<br><br>Then.
<br><br>The fierce three muffled stick knocked over.
<br><br>The three demons have not yet understood what is going on, was knocked unconscious, and then was put into the spatial ring.
<br><br>So far.
<br><br>West demon forest three demon immortals came a long way, vowed to prepare to come to the immortal world to do something big.
<br><br>But the sky has unpredictable wind.
<br><br>Their immortal world air has not even inhaled a mouthful, was Yi Feng to capture away.
<br><br>Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Heaven's Immortal Hall.
<br><br>It has the supreme power and control in the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>If the Immortal World was a kingdom, the Heavenly Immortal Palace was the proper imperial city.
<br><br>Therefore, some people say that the Heavenly Immortal Hall is the projection of the Heavenly Dao in the Immortal World.
<br><br>The entire immortal world is divided into 108 immortal continents, and although all 108 immortal continents are under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Immortal Palace, the controllers of them are also lords.
<br><br>They manage the immortal continents on behalf of the Heavenly Immortal Palace, and they also manage the lower realms on the other side.
<br><br>The stronger the immortal continent is, the wider the area is, the more powerful people there are, and the more lower planes are under their jurisdiction.
<br><br>Green Jade Immortal Continent.
<br><br>In the 108 immortal continents, although it is not considered a superior existence, it is definitely not the weakest either.
<br><br>A man with a thick power emanating from his body is sitting at the top, holding a fresh piece of meat in his hand, feeding a big black bird next to him.
<br><br>If someone was here they would have noticed that the fresh meat, but also contains a thick power.
<br><br>Enough to show that the owner of this fresh meat, the strength is not weak in life.
<br><br>I'm afraid that, at least, is also the cultivation of heavenly immortals.
<br><br>Immortal strength has many divisions, there are also many strong, just strong, but most of them are just ordinary immortals.
<br><br>Universal Immortal.
<br><br>There are three main levels: heaven, earth and human.
<br><br>The human immortal is the most low level, the lower realm of the ascendants over, is the human immortal realm.
<br><br>Earth Immortal is another level.
<br><br>As for the Heavenly Immortal, it is the highest level of Immortals in the Universal Immortal.
<br><br>Therefore, using the meat of the Heavenly Immortal level to feed the big black bird was enough to prove this person's astounding gesture.
<br><br>Just.
<br><br>He had this qualification.
<br><br>He was the continent lord of the Green Jade Immortal Continent, a super powerhouse whose strength did not know how much beyond the Universal Immortal, Su Xuanjun.
<br><br>"Enlighten the continent lord, there is something important to report."
<br><br>At this moment, a subordinate came to report and knelt down respectfully.
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun glanced at the subordinate indifferently and continued to feed the large black bird in front of him.
<br><br>"A lower realm called the Immortal River Continent has recently had frequent ascendants soar up and enter our Qingyu Immortal Continent." The subordinate enlightened.
<br><br>"Immortal River Continent?"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun slowly put down the fresh meat in his hand and suddenly frowned.
<br><br>"I remember millions of years ago, wasn't there an ascended person in this Immortal River Continent who disobeyed the discipline and I punished them for not being allowed to ascend permanently, so how come there are ascended people coming up?" Su Xuanjun asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Lord of the Continent, this is exactly the reason why I am reporting to you."
<br><br>The subordinate said, "For some reason, this Immortal River Continent has regained the Irrigation of Immortality, so there must have been some man-made change."
<br><br>"Artificial change?"
<br><br>"Can't this group of lower-ranked people from the next term still break my seal?"
<br><br>"To them, I am the sky and cannot be disobeyed."
<br><br>Su Xuanjun snorted coldly and said, "So artificial change is impossible, rather other changes, it may not be possible to say ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, he turned his gaze to the big black bird in front of him.
<br><br>Commanded: "Black feather, you go down to this immortal river continent to take a trip, find out for me what happened, and then come back to me."
