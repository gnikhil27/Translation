"Ah!"
<br><br>Black Feather's harsh and miserable scream immediately spread across the plain.
<br><br>This slap, hit his soul trembled, his liver was broken, and he fell to the ground dying, almost not sending him away directly.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>What he couldn't believe was how this slap from this dog bear was so strong, so strong that he, a Golden Immortal existence, could barely carry it.
<br><br>This is simply out of the ordinary!
<br><br>Just as he was thinking, the black bear grabbed him up again and slapped him down, slap after slap.
<br><br>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh ......"
<br><br>A time, the black feather's miserable screams, bird feathers also shed scattered in all directions.
<br><br>The beaten black feather grinned, crying, stammered and shouted: "You this strength, if a little more, I guess estimate really will send me away ......"
<br><br>However, because the second half of his sentence was somewhat ambiguous, fell on the black bear's ears but some variation. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"I this strength, also, a little more?"
<br><br>The black bear looked at the black feather with some incomprehension, thinking that this guy is really a masochist, so he had to nod reluctantly.
<br><br>The bulky body jumped up, swung up the heavy bear paw, cleaved the face and covered it.
<br><br>Knowing that the black bear heard the wrong words when the black feather expected that something was wrong, immediately creeped out, scared almost soul.
<br><br>"No, no, no, no, not ......"
<br><br>He waved his wings to explain, but before he could say it, the black bear's heavy slap landed on his head.
<br><br>"Ga ......"
<br><br>A miserable scream.
<br><br>Bird feathers scattered in all directions, and Black Feather fainted and died on the ground.
<br><br>It was a long, long time before Black Feather's hundred slaps were finished, and then the scene was staged on the body of Rhinoceros Forest and other demons.
<br><br>The black bear, who was panting, was able to collect a lot of force when it came to the rhinoceros and other demons, so as not to kill the three of them.
<br><br>But the same, although the black bear strength to weaken a lot, but the strength of the three demons than the black feather is also quite a bit worse, so they were also drawn nose-to-nose, several times almost did not pass, that way away.
<br><br>But compared to the black feather.
<br><br>Rhinoceros forest three demons but seems to have a lot of backbone.
<br><br>Gritting his teeth, staring at a pair of fire-breathing eyes, full of reluctance.
<br><br>Always is not low.
<br><br>"Ignore them a few trash, go we go to pick up Xiao Xiaoqing." Bone Ben Wei said lightly, not even putting them in his eyes, and rushed towards the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf's tribe.
<br><br>The Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf tribe.
<br><br>Heaven Devouring Emperor Ao Zhong stood with a gloomy face, and behind him stood the other clansmen of the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolves, who were like a great enemy.
<br><br>In addition, behind Ao Zhong, there was a beautiful-looking woman, who also looked worried.
<br><br>Opposite them, there was a tall woman standing, wearing a revealing dress, with slightly dark skin, giving a wild look, precisely the Milk Leopard Li of the Western Demon Forest.
<br><br>It was Milk Leopard Li that made the entire Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan like a great enemy.
<br><br>"I repeat, let me take those seven young wolves away, otherwise it is a waste of their talent to put them in your tribe, just let me take them away, I promise you, give them the best cultivation resources." Milk Leopard Li said leisurely.
<br><br>"I can't promise you that."
<br><br>Before Ao Zhong could open his mouth, the woman behind Ao Zhong who looked heavenly spoke up, she was none other than Ao Qingcheng of the Red Sun lineage at the beginning, and was also the mother of the seven young wolves.
<br><br>Her attitude was extraordinarily resolute.
<br><br>Because she understands that this place is the Eastern Victory, going to the Western Demon Forest almost has to cross the entire continent.
<br><br>This trip, there would be no return.
<br><br>"Good, we won't promise you."
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Zhong also spoke solemnly, "Because the child's father, is not going to promise you, and with him, there is no need for your Western Demon Forest's cultivation."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"The child's father?"
<br><br>Milk Leopard Li emitted a mighty pressure and said leisurely, "I am curious, what exactly is the child's father, and even more curious, what can a person from a small tribe achieve, who actually does not even put the cultivation of my Western Demon Forest in his eyes?"
<br><br>"Hmph, to tell you the truth, my son is a subordinate of a supreme master!" Ao Zhong said arrogantly.
<br><br>"Giggle giggle ......"
<br><br>However, a gloomy laugh came from Milk Leopard Li.
<br><br>"A subordinate of a supreme master, is it very powerful?"
<br><br>She asked rhetorically.
<br><br>At the same time as she spoke, the Demon Emperor's aura was immediately exposed, giving the entire Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan a great pressure.
<br><br>Under this pressure, even Ao Zhong was a little unsteady on his feet, and immediately his face changed greatly.
<br><br>Never thought that this Milk Leopard Li was actually a demon emperor.
<br><br>That Ao Qing even rushed back, can stop a demon emperor?
<br><br>So, under the pressure of the demon emperor, Ao Zhong also became suddenly bottomless and had to say stiffly, "My son, too, is also very strong, even if it's not as good as you, but I believe it's not too much worse."
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>Milk Pao Li saw through Ao Zhong's lack of bottom line with a glance, and immediately applied pressure: "Today I will put words with you here, my patience is limited, no matter what your son is, and not to mention that he is not here, even here I have only one word."
<br><br>"That is, today, I must take the seven coyotes away."
<br><br>"Whether you are willing or not, it will not change the outcome."
<br><br>Her voice, full of majesty.
<br><br>It left no room for doubt.
<br><br>The entire Sky Devouring Demon Wolf clan was unable to refute, and Ao Qingcheng also clenched her shell teeth, not knowing what to do for a while.
<br><br>Just then, a voice came from the sky, cursing loudly, "Where did the bastard come from, pretending so much even in front of this scum, and wanting to take away my nephew, don't you want to live anymore?"
