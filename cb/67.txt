But yet, in the face of Peng Ying's intimidating pressure, Demon Ling'er showed no fluctuation, and even revealed a mocking gaze.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"Why are you okay?"
<br><br>Peng Ying's face changed and asked incredulously, for some reason, Demon Ling'er's blandness suddenly made her heart very bottomless, could it be that her own cultivation level was wrong?
<br><br>But, no, she herself can strongly feel her "terrifying" cultivation!
<br><br>"Why should I be okay?"
<br><br>The demon spirit child raised the corner of her mouth and smiled.
<br><br>"Then why aren't you afraid of me?" Peng Ying said in a slight panic: "I am a cultivator, why aren't you afraid of me, aren't you afraid that I will kill you?"
<br><br>"So what if you're a cultivator?" Demon Ling'er said disdainfully, "So, come and kill me instead!"
<br><br>A barefaced provocation.
<br><br>This made Peng Ying's face filled with gloom, and Demon Spiritual's boldness made her more and more bottomless, but the more so, the stronger her hatred for Demon Spiritual. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because, it put her authority as a cultivator, in doubt!
<br><br>"Go to hell!"
<br><br>Under the anger, Peng Ying raised his long sword in his hand and pointed it straight towards Demon Spirit'er without any fancy.
<br><br>This sudden scene caused the faces of the onlookers present to change greatly, and their hearts were already mourning for Demon Spirit'er.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>However, what one did not expect was that along with a long sword trembling sound, the long sword in Peng Ying's hand came out of his hand and subsequently fell inside the river.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The crowd instantly revealed an unbelievable look.
<br><br>Because they did not even see what happened, Peng Ying longsword has fallen into the river.
<br><br>Peng Ying's face looked like she had seen a ghost and looked at Demon Ling'er with fear.
<br><br>Others are not clear, but as a party she is clear, the demon spirit child just flicked a finger on her longsword, the force from which she could not hold the longsword, out of hand.
<br><br>Even, that power now makes her arm numb.
<br><br>"You ...... you you you ......"
<br><br>Looking at Demon Ling'er, Peng Ying's face was white, and her feet subconsciously retreated.
<br><br>"I what I?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er narrowed her eyes, her paws forced towards Peng Ying step by step, her voice said in a low voice: "You are a small ninth level martial artist, where did you get the courage to let you be so rampant?"
<br><br>At the same time as her voice fell, Demon Ling'er's body silently emitted a pressure that enveloped towards Peng Ying.
<br><br>Peng Ying backed up in fear, especially when she felt this pressure, fear spread rapidly in her heart, the arrogance just now half gone, only a strong fear left.
<br><br>She couldn't figure out why Demon Ling'er, who was a cultivator, would be so respectful to Yi Feng, a mole, and become his fan, saying "Mr."!
<br><br>"Do you think that you, a ninth level martial artist, you deserve to be called a cultivator?" At this point, Demon Spirituality unforgivingly forced the question, and even more word by word pearl heart.
<br><br>"Are you worthy?"
<br><br>Peng Ying's face was ugly and he closed his mouth.
<br><br>"I'm asking you something."
<br><br>Demon spirit child forced to ask.
<br><br>The voice fell at the same time, a slap on Peng Ying's face.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"You what you?"
<br><br>The voice fell, another slap on Peng Ying's face, then continued to force the question, "Say ah, just this little cultivation, you deserve to be called a cultivator?"
<br><br>"No ......"
<br><br>Peng Ying swallowed and stammered, his expression full of reluctance.
<br><br>"No what?"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er still pressed the question, at the same time, another slap hailed past.
<br><br>At once, Peng Ying a face was beaten red, red and swollen like a pig, aggrieved tears from the eyes slipped down.
<br><br>And such a scene, also looked at the crowd, including Yi Feng dumbfounded.
<br><br>This woman is too hot, right?
<br><br>Seeing that Demon Ling'er was about to slap her again, Peng Ying said reluctantly with tears streaming down her face, "No, I'm not worthy ......"
<br><br>"Humph, then get lost!"
<br><br>Demon Ling'er sneered disdainfully and directly smacked another slap over.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>With a pout, Peng Ying's body tumbled in mid-air, and then smashed heavily into the river.
<br><br>Without another glance at Peng Ying, Demon Ling'er turned to look at Yi Feng, the expression on her face had changed to one of great style.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>She said gently, while giving a slight salute towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Thank you for your help, Miss." Yi Feng responded in a soft voice.
<br><br>"You are welcome, sir." Demon Ling'er said softly, "I'm afraid that sir doesn't know who I am yet, I am ......"
<br><br>However, just as she was halfway through her sentence, Yi Feng interrupted with a smile, "No need to go to such trouble, we've already met before."
<br><br>"Met before?"
<br><br>At those words, Demon Spirit's body trembled.
<br><br>Fiercely stunned in place, a time half a sentence can not say, could not say, he has long known her identity?
<br><br>The last time she disguised herself, he had already seen through?
<br><br>I can't help but, demon spirit child out of a cold sweat!
<br><br>Thinking of this, she hurriedly explained, "Sir, I'm really sorry, before I did it because ......"
<br><br>"No need to say it, it's no big deal."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said with a smile, just now he did see Demon Ling'er, after all, Demon Ling'er in front of him that fake fall, he is not not not see in his eyes.
<br><br>So did not help her, also because do not know, after all, a do not know the beauty suddenly like this, there must be a demon ah!
<br><br>But now it seems that he was wrong about her, it turns out to be his own fans.
<br><br>Fans, worship their idols, engage in a little girl's family tune to attract his attention is not too much, so look at her anxious and embarrassed look, Yi Feng interrupted her just in time.
<br><br>After all, women are more shy, see through not say through this is the best policy.
<br><br>Just, my damn face and talent ah ......
<br><br>Hearing Yi Feng say so, demon Ling'er subconsciously wiped the sweat on his forehead, a sigh of relief.
<br><br>In the heart, also can not help but bitter smile.
<br><br>It turns out that her identity people have long known.
<br><br>But let her feel grateful that he seems to own identity, not much matter, this kind of people's city is really difficult to guess ah!
<br><br>But think carefully can also find the reason, in his eyes Xuanwu Sect is only a small sect and really did not take it to heart.
<br><br>But, see through their own identity, but do not see through their own purpose to ah!
<br><br>Thinking of this, demon spirit child is both a little shy, heart and some nervous.
<br><br>"And Miss Yun'er, thank you as well." Yi Feng picked up Mao Yun'er who was on the side and said softly.
<br><br>"Thank you sir."
<br><br>Feeling the force of Yi Feng's arm, Mao Yun'er lowered her head and blushed her pretty face.
<br><br>"It's nothing, it's my turn to thank you guys, right, to show my appreciation, I'll treat you two to a meal tonight!" Yi Feng said softly.
<br><br>At that, the two women's faces lit up and they hurriedly agreed.
<br><br>This scene, is simply envious of the next person, passing a jealous and envious eyes.
<br><br>This kind of thing happened, Yi Feng has no more interest in this what poetry conference, complex glance at the still in the river Peng Ying, Yi Feng and two women temporarily said goodbye to leave.
<br><br>After Yi Feng and the others left, a white-robed figure swept in quickly and landed in the crowd.
<br><br>"Wow, another cultivator."
<br><br>When the crowd saw this, they dodged away, also not expecting that another cultivator had come.
<br><br>The person who came was none other than Yu Wujie, who had just come down from the mountain. He had easily gotten out of the Castle Peak Sect prison and couldn't wait to ask Peng Ying to meet him here.
<br><br>"Ying'er, where are you, Ying'er?" Yu Wujie shouted.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Jie, I ......"
<br><br>And at this time, Peng Ying, who had just come out of the river before she had time to clean up, ran into Yu Wu Jie head-on.
<br><br>"What's wrong with you?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie's face sank and he asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"I, I ......"
<br><br>Said, Peng Ying tears slipped down.
<br><br>"And, what are you doing holding your face?" Yu Wujie asked with another frown.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Jie, I was bullied." Peng Ying said with pity, "My face is hurt."
<br><br>"What? What kind of person dares to be so bold, Ying'er don't be afraid, I will help you take revenge, first let me see how your face is injured?" Yu Wujie said in a gentle voice as he came next to Peng Ying, worried.
<br><br>"But, I'm very ugly now, it will take me a long time to recover, Brother Wujie you won't mind me, right?" Peng Ying asked nervously with a face full of hesitation.
<br><br>"Why would Ying'er, how would I dislike you, quickly let me take a look." Yu Wujie said with concern.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>After squirming for a long time, Peng Ying then put down her palm and revealed the battered and swollen face.
<br><br>Instantly.
<br><br>Yu Wujie's eyes almost burst out.
<br><br>"Holy shit, what the hell are you?"
<br><br>While speaking, a foot landed on Peng Ying, who directly flew out backwards and smashed heavily into the river, making a splash.
