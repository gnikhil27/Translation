"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"When will this day ever end!"
<br><br>Under the gloomy steps, a centipede wailed in its heart.
<br><br>This period of time.
<br><br>He was really doubting life.
<br><br>The shock and fear that this martial arts school brought him was simply refreshing his upper limit again and again, at this rate, he was afraid that he would never be able to escape from this step seam in his life.
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>Crying in mourning, he fiercely a stirring, then saw a big white hand grasping towards him.
<br><br>In the crisis, the night wind centipede subconsciously bite away.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>However, it was like biting on a piece of steel, the latter did not say anything, but his own pair of biting pincers crunched and broke. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"My pincers!"
<br><br>Night Wind Centipede roared inwardly, but the next moment he was grabbed by the palm of this hand.
<br><br>The skeleton sat on the steps, playing with the centipede in his hand, hanging it in the air while his fingertips did not forget to flick it under that belly.
<br><br>"Qing ah, you say the centipede is divided into male and female?"
<br><br>The skeleton could not help but ask towards the dog on the side, asking the question while the fingertips could not help but flick again.
<br><br>"It should be divided!"
<br><br>Ao Qing said uncertainly.
<br><br>"Alas, you say I skeleton Ben Wei how powerful a bone, women can not play, reduced to play centipede, really a penny hard to skeleton bone ah!" The skeleton shook his head, a look of hopelessness.
<br><br>"Brother, it's all my fault, it's all my fault."
<br><br>Looking at big brother this kind of life and death, the dog Ao Qing immediately passed out a remorseful voice.
<br><br>"Harm, still say this why, it's all fate!"
<br><br>The skeleton sighed long and hard.
<br><br>"Brother, do not be discouraged, you are so handsome, suave, the universe invincible, heavenly immortals down to earth, the country and the city, sinking fish, two young, sitting in the well, green mountains and water, and still in addition to the master, the world's first scum, there will always be money in the future!" Ao Qing cheered and cheered.
<br><br>"Qing ah, educated people is different, this boast up a set of people, or talk to you comfortable ah!"
<br><br>The skeleton will palm down on Ao Qing's shoulder, remembered what and asked: "But you said before, I know probably know is complimenting me, but you can talk to brother well, that the last scum is what it means?"
<br><br>"I do not know where this comes from, but listen to the ground work of those who often say that the master is scum, it should be a compliment, like a beautiful man almost the meaning." The dog scratched his head, probably so explained.
<br><br>"So it is, this name I like." The skeleton said with satisfaction: "I plan to, from now on I will be called scum skeleton Ben Wei!"
<br><br>"Congratulations brother congratulations brother."
<br><br>The dog comforted: "So brother, our capital in, not worried about money right, big deal we find a new place to get money?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>"Good point."
<br><br>The skeleton slapped his thigh, stood up and said, "Qing ah, your words have given me back my confidence, let's go back to get money."
<br><br>"Yes, go on and get the money, Ollie give!"
<br><br>The dog raised his paw and cheered.
<br><br>A time, a bone a dog full of hope for the future, a shot to take a gold coin and went out.
<br><br>And the centipede, Bones Ben Wei also subconsciously took out.
<br><br>Watching these two goods out of the martial arts school, lying on the recliner Yi Feng glanced at them, and did not care.
<br><br>Happy to be free.
<br><br>"Sir, are you there?"
<br><br>Just at this moment, a familiar voice came from the entrance of the store.
<br><br>Yi Feng got up and walked towards the outside, smiling slightly, "So it's you, why are you free to come today?"
<br><br>"I came to visit you today on purpose, sir." The visitor was none other than Yun Xian Que, and at the same time she was holding a delicate box in her hand.
<br><br>"You're welcome, come in and sit down."
<br><br>Yi Feng greeted with a smile and invited Yun Xian Que in.
<br><br>Even though it was the second time he came to this martial hall, the scene of treasures everywhere inside already made Yun Xian Que couldn't help but marvel.
<br><br>After sitting down for a while and chatting, Yun Xian Que then respectfully got up and said, "Sir, last time I heard you say that the string was broken, so I went back and found this Hong Tu silk, this Hong Tu silk might not be as good as the Heavenly Toad silk that Miss Shu Qinhua said, and I don't even know if you can see it, but this is my heart, so I hope you can accept it. "
<br><br>Saying that, she respectfully handed out the box in her hand.
<br><br>However, she was very apprehensive in her heart.
<br><br>She was afraid that Yi Feng would not be able to see this Hong Tou Silk, so this move, she was completely bored.
<br><br>Because although the Hongtu silk is good, but only the clan product, clan product things with this one's heritage, I'm afraid that even rags can not compare.
<br><br>But even so, it was the best thing she could find on short notice that could be used as a string.
<br><br>Even so, it also used the great resources of the Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>But it seemed to be worth it to Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>Not even seeking to get any big chance here in Yi Feng, but anything that can make Yi Feng have some good feeling towards them, is worth a lot!
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised.
<br><br>He also didn't expect this sister to be so on point, not only did she take what he said last time to heart, but she also sent it over personally.
<br><br>So Yi Feng was greatly touched, so Feng Guan this silk is good, people are this sincere, Yi Feng also did not refuse the reason.
<br><br>"Miss Yun is really too polite, your feelings I accept." Yi Feng also did not polite, took the box handed by Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>"Ah really sir?"
<br><br>"It's really nice that sir doesn't mind."
<br><br>Seeing that Yi Feng did not dislike her things, Yun Xian Que was flattered and immediately surprised out, happy like a child.
<br><br>This girl ......
<br><br>Could it be that she has taken a fancy to me?
<br><br>Because this look reminds him of a former life of a housemate lick dog, send things accepted by the goddess, is also such a general nothing.
<br><br>Can't help but, he inclined his head to look at his reflection in the mirror not far away.
<br><br>Hmm!
<br><br>Is a little handsome.
<br><br>"Thank you, sir, I will leave now." Yun Xian Que's face was rosy, and under happiness, he bade farewell towards Yi Feng and was about to bounce away.
<br><br>"Eh wait."
<br><br>Looking at this sister's appearance, Yi Feng always felt some pressure.
<br><br>"Is there anything else, sir?" Yun Xian Que couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Last time I saw you come over, it seems that you also quite like calligraphy and painting, I have a good pair of calligraphy and painting here, give it to you!"
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng turned back and took out a painting from the room.
<br><br>After all, in Yi Feng's opinion, no matter if this sister likes herself, it is always right to exchange gifts.
<br><br>Looking at the painting in Yi Feng's hand, Yun Xian Que covered her red lips with both hands and stared with big eyes full of incredulity.
<br><br>She came here, but did not think that Yi Feng could give her any chance, but did not think that Yi Feng was so righteous.
<br><br>She understood what this painting of Yi Feng represented.
<br><br>A heavenly chance!
<br><br>"Thank you, sir."
<br><br>For a moment, Yun Xian Que's tears of excitement flowed down her face, bowed towards Yi Feng, and solemnly accepted the painting with both hands before bidding farewell.
<br><br>After sending away Yun Xian Que, Yi Feng opened the box and observed the Hong Tou silk.
<br><br>Out of Yi Feng's Yi Feng, this thing is really good as a string.
<br><br>So Yi Feng hurriedly took the guitar out, then he took it upon himself to change the strings.
<br><br>Also at this time.
<br><br>The martial arts school door appeared two more figures.
<br><br>It was the Devil's Voice Sect Patriarch, Xue Qinzhu, and the complex-faced Shu Qinhua.
