He was in doubt.
<br><br>Next to him, Yang Tianyu seemed to have stepped on something, moved his paws to take a look, and immediately exclaimed.
<br><br>"This is, this is the head of that Second Life Demon Emperor last night?"
<br><br>The crowd rushed over at once.
<br><br>The others did not see the appearance of this giant auger being beaten into its origin, but Li Shuhua had seen it, and he immediately exclaimed, "Yes, yes, this is the head of that second-life demon emperor."
<br><br>"Good, there's still peeled off snake skin on this ground." On the side, Yun Haotian looked at the snake skin peeled off on the ground, and also spoke.
<br><br>It's just that this snake skin is so badly peeled that it has lost its value, otherwise the skin of an emperor demon beast would be priceless.
<br><br>At this time, Xue Qinzhu seemed to think of something and exclaimed, "This snake head snake skin of the ground, they can't be, they ate that emperor grade demon beast, right?"
<br><br>The crowd suddenly realized.
<br><br>This, it is really possible.
<br><br>But just as they were shocked, the fifth Tianming suddenly held a pot, swept the air and ran. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Seeing this pot, the crowd instantly reacted and cursed openly: "Fifth Tianming, you are despicable, actually hiding a solo meal."
<br><br>But the fifth Tianming where to pay attention to them, deadly holding that pot, will speed to the extreme.
<br><br>Now where could he not see that the monstrous power had boiled that second-life demon beast in this pot into soup, and the breakthrough of those two Martial Emperors was feared to be closely related to this soup.
<br><br>This kind of to hand amazing great opportunity, where he will be willing to let out.
<br><br>"Chase!"
<br><br>The others glanced at each other and blocked towards Fifth Heavenly Ming.
<br><br>Although the fifth Tianming's speed was fast, there were always those who were faster than him among these few people, and they were immediately surrounded by the crowd right in the middle.
<br><br>And behind them, Peng Xian'er, Yun Xianque and others also rushed over, and looking at the fight between several supreme beings in this Southern Sand, they immediately understood that that one had really left behind an opportunity.
<br><br>However, the strength of the others was simply not qualified to participate in the scramble, and their faces could not help but be filled with powerlessness and resignation.
<br><br>"Damn it damn it!"
<br><br>Especially Peng Xian'er, her Heavenly Sword Sect's Sect Master did not come over at all due to his seclusion, so her Heavenly Sword Sect, could only be watching with bated breath.
<br><br>"Fifth Tianming, put down the pot in your hand, or we will not be polite to you." Yang Tianyu said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Good, if you do not put down the pot in your hand, then you have to weigh whether you alone are a match for so many of us." Xue Qinzhu also said with a cold face.
<br><br>In a moment, the people who seemed to be on good terms before, immediately became saber-rattling.
<br><br>Fifth Tianming's face was ugly.
<br><br>He was not good at fighting at all, plus his cultivation level was at the bottom of the crowd, so if he really fought, he would not be able to win.
<br><br>So, he simply played a scoundrel and said, "Hmph, if you guys attack me in a group, I will pour this pot, and no one will get the benefit."
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The faces of the crowd changed.
<br><br>"Then what do you want?" Yun Haotian asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"It's simple, there's about one bowl of soup left in this pot, I'll drink one third of it alone, and the rest you guys will divide it yourselves." Fifth Tianming said, "If not, I will pour out the pot."
<br><br>The people looked at each other.
<br><br>They also knew that this was the best way to go, so they acquiesced to the fifth Tianming's proposal.
<br><br>Seeing this, the fifth Tianming held up the cauldron with both hands, tilted his head and began to drink.
<br><br>"Already drank enough, hurry up and give it to me."
<br><br>Seeing this, Li Shuhua stabbed his sword.
<br><br>"You are despicable."
<br><br>Fifth Tianming hadn't even drunk a third of it, but at this moment, he was only able to shake the cauldron to avoid the sword.
<br><br>Li Shuhua took the cauldron and also picked it up and drank it.
<br><br>But just as he drank, the attack behind him came one after another.
<br><br>In this way under the back and forth fight between you and me, the leaders of several major powers were considered to have a small taste of the rain.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I'm going to break through."
<br><br>At this time, Yun Haotian was the first to emit a voice.
<br><br>"I'm going to break through too."
<br><br>"Me too."
<br><br>"A divine medicine!"
<br><br>"A heavenly immortal pill is not too much!"
<br><br>In a flash, the leaders of several major powers emitted their voices, and then their auras soared, and their strength at the peak of Martial Exaltation close to Half-Saint then began to break through directly to Saint.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>The sky was dense with clouds, and countless spiritual qi surged towards this side.
<br><br>Five experts broke the saint at the same time.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>It immediately stunned the crowd.
<br><br>"Brothers, rush, quickly see if there are any left."
<br><br>At once, everyone present went berserk, and immediately hundreds of people pounced towards the pot that was thrown down.
<br><br>"Look, there seems to be a remnant on the ground here too."
<br><br>Hundreds more people rushed towards the place where Yi Feng had lifted the pot before, grabbed the dirt with the soup left on the ground, and stuffed it inside their mouths.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Living like hungry wolves pouncing on food.
<br><br>"Let's go too."
<br><br>Fifth Changkong and Yun Xianque looked at each other and rushed towards that pot, joining the scramble for that pot.
<br><br>"Hmph, one of you is the young master of the Blowing Snow Villa and the other is the eldest lady of the Wind and Cloud Valley, also joining this scramble, aren't you afraid of losing your price?"
<br><br>Looking at the two people who also went to compete, Peng Xian'er emitted a mocking voice.
<br><br>Obviously, there are still many people who hold their own identity and are unwilling to go over to the people who are fighting for it, and Peng Xian'er is one of them.
<br><br>In her opinion, to compete for the soup inside that pot, the remnants of this left over, and how much can increase cultivation?
<br><br>She hated the pot she could not do anything about, even with Yang Tianyu breakthroughs, his Heavenly Sword Gate instantly became the bottom of the South Sand.
<br><br>So for those scraps, she did not think!
<br><br>And the fifth Changkong and Yun Xian Que's joint effort, naturally, is easily grabbed the pot.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was the first to start licking it up.
<br><br>"Don't lick it all up, leave some for me!" Fifth Longkong said blearily.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que reluctantly handed the pot to the fifth long empty, see the fifth long empty bubbling hot light, also crazy lick up.
<br><br>Looking at this a young master and a young lady so fallen behavior, Peng Xian'er face is more and more disdain ......
<br><br>But at this time, the sound of a breakthrough came from the side.
<br><br>Then I saw that the few picking dirt and stuffing their mouths, have begun to break through, from Martial Spirit to Martial King, from Martial King to Martial Emperor.
<br><br>And the next moment, the fifth Changkong and Yun Xian Que also gaze brightly, the body cultivation began to surge.
<br><br>They of the Martial Sects also began to advance towards Martial Dignity.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er, who just had a series of disdain, her expression suddenly froze.
