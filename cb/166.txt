"You guys pick whatever you want!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, he did not care what these beasts were called lightning or flying, in his opinion, as long as they were wild game, they were all good ingredients.
<br><br>Hearing that, Wu Yonghong several people then obediently picked an eagle to use for soup and drink, of course, also intend to get a roasted wolf leg.
<br><br>"Okay, that's it then!"
<br><br>Yi Feng clapped his hands and said, "I'll be the chef, you guys clean up the beasts, clean up the beasts, wash the dishes."
<br><br>On hearing that, Wu Yonghong and others hurriedly lifted up their sleeves and went to clean up the eagle and demon wolf.
<br><br>Especially looking at Yi Feng are hands-on appearance, the crowd also dare not use cultivation, accompanied by Yi Feng put the body to sense life.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Plucking hair plucking hair, boiling water boiling water, busy is not happy.
<br><br>"Right, old man Qingshan, you just go to the street to buy some herbs to, after all, you guys are old arms and legs, eat all the fun, but also be able to give you a tonic body!" Yi Feng took out some more gold coins and gave them to Lu Qingshan, while handing him a medicine list.
<br><br>"Okay." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Lu Qingshan took the gold coins and went up the street to buy medicine.
<br><br>Just as the people were busy, inside that pile of corpses, a centipede poked its head out and almost broke its legs in fear when it saw the breath of those few picking eagle hair.
<br><br>Then with visible speed will be smaller body, silently crawled to the steps under the hide.
<br><br>Not long after, the old ancestor of the green mountain herbs have bought back, and Wu Yonghong and others have also cleaned up the eagle and wolf.
<br><br>Yi Feng then began to show his hands, first of all, the Wang Ba soup with herbs to stew out, as for the wolf legs and eagle soup is still continuing to get.
<br><br>When the Wangba soup was almost ready, Wu Yonghong and other people's eyes lit up and they looked over.
<br><br>"My God!"
<br><br>Several people at this moment, speak almost stuttered!
<br><br>Because just by smelling the smell that came out, it felt like their strength had increased a lot.
<br><br>This simply left the crowd stunned.
<br><br>What the hell kind of divine tactics is this!
<br><br>Even though this is a demon emperor, but also will not play this effect, but into the hands of Mr., but has such an effect?
<br><br>Can't help but, the crowd subconsciously swallowed saliva.
<br><br>They breathed in sharply and also wanted to smell more of the flavor emitted from this old king's soup.
<br><br>"Got it."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the appearance of these old men, could not help but white, but still could not help but shout: "One of you take a small bowl over, but one can only give you a sip ah!"
<br><br>Hearing this, Wu Yonghong and others were so excited that their hearts were about to jump out, and one of them held a small bowl, scrambling to lean towards Yi Feng first.
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up the big pot ladle and began to boil soup for them, this look does not matter, actually the big pot ladle is also a holy product?
<br><br>Wu Yonghong several people's jaws are going to fall off in shock.
<br><br>"Aiya, calm down calm down, don't be whole like you've never seen the world!"
<br><br>After the contact, the old ancestor of Castle Peak also became familiar with them, and could not help but pat their shoulders, revealing the gaze of looking at the country bumpkins.
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>Wu Yonghong a few people instantly understood that this Qingshan certainly is not the first time into this kitchen, which means that the relationship with Mr. absolutely not expensive.
<br><br>Therefore, they instantly looked at Qingshan with a much more polite gaze, while their mouths politely said, "Thank you for reminding old brother Qingshan!"
<br><br>"Ha, you're welcome, just get used to it."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qingshan subconsciously raised his chest, feeling quite proud of himself.
<br><br>So what if I'm a Martial Arts Sect?
<br><br>Even if the cultivation level is much higher than mine, but I can't help but know the seniors first, but still have to be polite to me?
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Yi Feng gave them each a small bowl of soup, and the rest was carried to Zhong Qing.
<br><br>Looking at the soup in his hand, several people breathed sharply.
<br><br>Gulped a mouthful of saliva, hands directly holding the bowl and poured down, and do not know whether there is no taste, even the crumbs are given a clean meal.
<br><br>"Oops my grass!"
<br><br>Almost instantly, Wu Yonghong will exclaim, feel their dantian began to heat up, cultivation is actually climbing, look at this magnitude, afraid to break through the martial daddy.
<br><br>This cry drew out Yi Feng.
<br><br>Looking at the appearance of Wu Yonghong holding his stomach, he did not have the good grace to shout: "Blind than shouting what, noisy to my disciple, to go far away from the mutation."
<br><br>At that, Wu Yonghong a shiver, instantly understood.
<br><br>Bowed towards Yi Feng, and hurriedly ran towards the gate.
<br><br>And after Wu Yonghong ran out, Lu Qingshan and the others also hurriedly bowed towards Yi Feng and also followed and ran out quickly.
<br><br>"Hurry up, don't keep senior waiting, let's seize the time to break through!"
<br><br>After walking out of the gate, Wu Yonghong suppressed the signs of breakthrough and hurriedly said.
<br><br>"Quick, go to my Castle Peak Gate, my Castle Peak Gate has a formation that can briefly adjust the speed of time, let's quickly go there to break through!" Lu Qingshan shouted in a hurry.
<br><br>Several people flew towards the Castle Peak Gate with all their might.
<br><br>"All stomach pain to burst?"
<br><br>"Could it be that I have a problem with this soup?"
<br><br>Yi Feng remembered a few people's constipated appearance just now, full of confusion, looking at the small bowl of Wang Ba soup in his hand, he was not interested in eating, and poured it inside the dog bowl.
<br><br>The dog Ao Qing saw this, his eyes suddenly lit up, croaking instantly licked up.
<br><br>A few moments later, the dog a stirring, it ran out in a flash.
<br><br>"Is this Wang Ba too tonic, can't even hold up?"
<br><br>Looking at the dog also like this, Yi Feng smacked his lips, took a look at the Zhong Qing lying on the bed, thinking it would not shit all over the bed!
<br><br>Good thing, wait for a long time, also did not find this situation, Yi Feng then breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>An hour later, Lu Qingshan and the others returned to the entrance of the martial arts school refreshed.
<br><br>At this moment, they are already a full breakthrough.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan had broken through from the pre-Martial Emperor stage that he had just entered to the late Martial Sect stage, while the three Wu Yonghong had broken through from the pre-Martial Sect stage to the pre-Martial Dignity stage directly.
<br><br>The magnitude of this breakthrough is like going straight to the clouds.
<br><br>This is also the first time in their lives, but, looking at the martial hall in front of them, their eyes were even more respectful.
<br><br>After all, they understand.
<br><br>All of this is the gift of Mr.
<br><br>And in a little-known teleportation array outside of Pingjiang City, a line of powerful black-robed people, full of killing intent, walked out from it.
<br><br>Then swept high into the sky and flew towards Pingjiang City!
