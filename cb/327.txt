The next period of time.
<br><br>Yi Feng dived at home.
<br><br>Carving, brewing, making tea, cycling over and over again, attempting to raise all these tasks to the highest level.
<br><br>Because he was not willing to ah!
<br><br>Especially this time the incident of the mount, but also deeply stimulated his heart.
<br><br>But the more this happened, the more he wanted to see just how long this broken system was going to screw him over.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, the engraving has reached a level comparable to that of a god."
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>Listening to the familiar voice, Yi Feng put down the carving knife.
<br><br>The engraving was finally complete. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"View panel."
<br><br>"Host: Yi Feng."
<br><br>"Cultivation: undetectable."
<br><br>"Skills: eighteen martial arts and God, qin, chess, calligraphy and painting and God, healing and ironworking and God, cooking and God, cooking and God, brewing back to the basics, tea back to the basics ......"
<br><br>"Rub!"
<br><br>However, Yi Feng cursed directly.
<br><br>This dog system ......
<br><br>Before his cultivation at least can still show a "mortal", now actually become undetectable?
<br><br>You say he can cultivate, show an undetectable, but it can be understood that his strength is so great that the system directly can not detect.
<br><br>But can he cultivate?
<br><br>Is there cultivation?
<br><br>Saying that.
<br><br>He threw a punch at the sky!
<br><br>Half a minute passed, even the wind could not roll a trace ......
<br><br>This motherfucker, obviously wasted to undetectable ah!
<br><br>At this time ......
<br><br>Central Continent.
<br><br>Within an ancient tower, an old man with white hair swept up into the air and stepped into the sky above the clouds, flashing his unbelievable eyes, staring deadly at the scene in the distance.
<br><br>"What the hell is this?"
<br><br>He trembled his voice.
<br><br>Northern Sea Continent.
<br><br>A long-haired man came out with his sword, holding out a residual shadow in the sky, looking at the scene that appeared in the distant sky, the breezy man could no longer remain calm, and the long sword his feet stepped on became dull.
<br><br>Southern Wasteland Domain.
<br><br>A ten-foot-tall giant rose from the ground, raised his head and looked high into the distant sky, and suddenly knelt down.
<br><br>Western Demon Forest.
<br><br>In the dense jungle, a woman dressed in a revealing and flirtatious outfit suddenly felt an unprecedented oppressive aura that shook her and made her tremble, so that she could not help but turn into the Origin White Fox state and prostrate herself on the ground without even daring to move.
<br><br>In addition.
<br><br>In other parts of the Immortal River Continent, many Ten Life Martial Emperors, as well as countless old monsters who are not hidden from the world have been blown out, stepping in mid-air to watch the spectacle that just appeared.
<br><br>Because just now, the entire heaven and earth suddenly appeared a heaven-destroying aura.
<br><br>A fist transformed into a shadow, with the momentum of the sky suddenly appeared.
<br><br>A fist.
<br><br>Blasted through the sky!
<br><br>And the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>An unprecedented turmoil was sent out.
<br><br>The countless great powers of the immortal world gathered, their faces flickered with disbelief, and the fleeting fist that had just appeared came to mind in unison.
<br><br>But that punch.
<br><br>It directly broke the barrier of the immortal world.
<br><br>The ground and space of the immortal realm for 10,000 miles in circumference, directly smashed into nothingness.
<br><br>"This punch, where exactly did it come from?" A middle-aged man asked in surprise.
<br><br>"No, I don't know ......"
<br><br>An old man was equally grave, and his voice became a bit stuttered.
<br><br>"Could it be that the God's Other Side punched over?"
<br><br>Another person asked incredulously.
<br><br>"That group of high level existences on the other side of the Gods couldn't possibly do such a thing, it's more like it hit from the lower realms of the thousands."
<br><br>"Put your sister's fart, we can't even do this punch, which person from the lower realm is so powerful that they directly break the immortal barrier?" An old man with a filthy head holding a wine jug could not help but dislike him.
<br><br>Although this person's words were hard to hear, no one refuted him.
<br><br>Because what he said was the truth.
<br><br>If anyone from the lower realm could break the barrier with one punch, then they, the great figures of the immortal realm, might as well find a crack in the ground and burrow down.
<br><br>But this punch came and went so fast that even with their group of great figures in the immortal world, they couldn't catch the slightest breath.
<br><br>This punch can cause a psychological shadow except for them, they are half tracing methods ......
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng sat on the stool in dishevel, looking at his white and clean fist, sighing with sadness.
<br><br>Want to cultivate, how come it's so hard?
<br><br>"Ding."
<br><br>"New mission issued."
<br><br>Just at this moment, the voice that had just calmed down, rang out again.
<br><br>"Another new mission?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned, this damn system does not know what it wants him to learn again.
<br><br>"Mission content: the host is asked to expand the martial arts school at his own expense, create a sect, and take on one hundred disciples."
<br><br>"Shit!"
<br><br>As soon as he heard this voice, Yi Feng stood up violently and almost directly stormed out.
<br><br>Expanding the martial arts school at his own expense?
<br><br>How much money must this cost!
<br><br>The most darned thing is to create a clan?
<br><br>The mother of all martial arts schools can not recruit disciples, but also get a sect, this is a fucking pit to kill him?
<br><br>Others are blind to join this stupid sect?
<br><br>Just when Yi Feng was cursing, the system's voice sounded again.
<br><br>"Mission reward: the host can start cultivating."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Once he heard this mission reward, Yi Feng instantly froze.
<br><br>Cultivation.
<br><br>Cultivation.
<br><br>By completing this task he could cultivate?
<br><br>He, Yi Feng.
<br><br>Finally about to pass the system's test and become a real bully on the human?
<br><br>Yi Feng was simply filled with hot tears.
<br><br>In his eyes, shining with unprecedented light, also picked up the verve of just crossing over.
<br><br>"OK, not just self-funded expansion of the martial arts school, self-funded, as long as you can cultivate, it's not a matter."
<br><br>"And the sect, create, create, as for a hundred disciples, I pit also pit to come to a hundred people!"
<br><br>At this moment, Yi Feng was very proud.
<br><br>To the future life, full of expectations.
