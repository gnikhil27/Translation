"Oh my!"
<br><br>"Look, Lord Martial Saint has opened his eyes."
<br><br>Seeing this, the crowd present exclaimed, turning an incredulous gaze toward Yu Wujie.
<br><br>"No way!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was filled with shock under her veil when she saw this scene.
<br><br>At this moment, almost everyone tensed up.
<br><br>Because even for the book and qin painting, only after the playing was finished did Jiang Yu open his eyes and praise.
<br><br>And Yu Wujie this zither sound just started, Jiang Yu opened his eyes.
<br><br>It seems that this Martial Saint heritage, it is likely to be Yu Wu Jie took away ah!
<br><br>Then, in the crowd's nervous and expectant waiting, the sound of the zither was nearing its end.
<br><br>On top of the zither platform, Jiang Yu was full of excitement, and his eyes were staring deadly at Yu Wujie. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Finally, when Yu Wujie's zither sound came to an end, he was even emitting a dazzling golden light, and his whole body rose up.
<br><br>"Well, well!"
<br><br>"This song, it should only be found in the sky!"
<br><br>"You are very good, allowing this Saint to break through the last layer of the bottleneck." Saying that, Jiang Yu looked sharply at Yu Wujie and laughed loudly, "Next, this Saint's inheritance will be passed on to you!"
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"The Martial Saint's inheritance was actually really ......"
<br><br>As soon as Jiang Yu's words fell, the crowd present immediately set off a huge wave of Xuan Yuan.
<br><br>And Yu Wujie was almost dumbfounded, reacting with his heart filled with excitement and urgency, going crazy and shouting, "Martial Saint's inheritance, Martial Saint's inheritance, hahaha, I, Yu Wujie, actually got Martial Saint's inheritance!"
<br><br>"Brother Yu, congratulations!"
<br><br>"Brother Yu is really great, not only did you open the Heavenly Gate at the beginning, but now you have become a Martial Saint Inheritance!"
<br><br>"Brother Yu, congratulations on going to the top of your life, I said hello to you before, don't forget me in the future!"
<br><br>"Yes, yes to brother Yu, come to my Luo Sheng Sect to sit down often in the future when you have time."
<br><br>Although the crowd felt lost for not being this lucky person, but quickly reacted to what to do now, the first time began to close relations with Yu Wujie.
<br><br>After all, having received the Martial Saint's inheritance, unless Yu Wujie was a pig, his future achievements would not be low and he would be more likely to become a Martial Saint than anyone else.
<br><br>"Ahaha, good to say."
<br><br>"You're welcome, you're welcome."
<br><br>"I will definitely go to sit in the Luo Sheng Sect in the future."
<br><br>Listening to the voices that curry favor with him, Yu Wujie felt that his whole body floated to the sky, holding his head high with his posture and clasping his fist one by one towards the crowd.
<br><br>"I wanted to use this waste first, and finally let him suffer torture and kneel down to die in front of me, but I didn't expect that this waste, following the opening of the Heavenly Gate, actually became a Martial Saint Inheritor." Under the veil, Peng Xian'er's face was resigned, her fists clenched tightly.
<br><br>"Holy Maiden, so what now?"
<br><br>Long Jiankong also had a complicated face, he knew more or less about Peng Xian'er's previous affairs, and never expected that things had evolved into this.
<br><br>"A Martial Saint Inheritor, it's not trivial."
<br><br>She gritted her teeth, and despite being full of reluctance, she also knew the importance of the matter, and directly raised her head and said, "Yu Wujie, I now announce that I will let you officially join my Heavenly Sword Sect."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie, who was dealing with the crowd, heard the words and immediately raised the corners of his mouth to look over and said with a smile, "It's not impossible for me to join the Heavenly Sword Sect, but Xian'er you have to be my woman to do so!"
<br><br>"You!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's face sank, never expecting Yu Wujie to get carried away so quickly.
<br><br>But at this moment she could only hold back and continued to say with a smile towards Yu Wujie: "Then as long as you have the ability, it is not impossible for me to be your woman."
<br><br>"Good, good, then I will join your Heavenly Sword Sect, then you must also show some ability."
<br><br>Yu Wujie said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>There is no longer the humble appearance in front of Peng Xian'er, instead, his tone is full of flirtation and meaningful.
<br><br>"Little woman Shu Qinhua, meet Mr. Yu." At this time, even Shu Qin Painting could not help but walk towards Yu Wu Jie and said softly, "If you are free in the future, can you talk about the zither and compose songs together with Duke Yu?"
<br><br>"Haha, good point."
<br><br>Yu Wujie laughed arrogantly, so what if he is the first genius of Nansha, he still has to be polite in front of him?
<br><br>This feeling, it's so great!
<br><br>What a great feeling!
<br><br>I, Yu Wujie, finally have capital today, from now on everywhere I go is the existence of being worshiped.
<br><br>Hahahahaha ......
<br><br>"Disciple, you come here."
<br><br>At this time, Jiang Yu, who was standing on the piano platform, sent out his voice towards Yu Wujie leisurely.
<br><br>"It's Master."
<br><br>Yu Wujie walked over with a joyful heart and stood respectfully in front of Jiang Yu.
<br><br>"Ah disciple, tell me, do you have the music score in your hand?" Jiang Yu asked with a smile.
<br><br>"Of course I do."
<br><br>Yu Wujie hastily pulled out the music score from his arms and respectfully handed it to Jiang Yu.
<br><br>"Seconds and seconds, it really is a divine tune!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu looked at the sheet music in his hand and burst out laughing madly, then he looked down and asked a question towards Yu Wujie.
<br><br>"Disciple, let me ask you, did you compose this music score?"
<br><br>"Enlightened master, this is the apprentice after several overnight efforts to produce ah!" Yu Wujie said with his head bowed.
<br><br>"Good, good, really is my good disciple, not only did you compose this divine music, I heard that the two gates of heaven and earth that I set up were also cracked by you?" Jiang Yu asked leisurely.
<br><br>"Yes, Master, I opened the two gates of heaven and earth." Yu Wujie said with pride, "After all, as your disciple, I can't lose face to you."
<br><br>"You are indeed my good disciple."
<br><br>Jiang Yu smiled broadly and beckoned towards Yu Wujie, saying leisurely, "Come, come, come, come closer to me, I will pass on the heritage to you."
<br><br>Yu Wujie was so excited that he took a few more steps closer to Jiang Yu, his face filled with fervor.
<br><br>"Come on, this will teach you the inheritance."
<br><br>Jiang Yu slowly dropped his palm to the top of Yu Wujie's head, his eyes suddenly narrowed.
<br><br>PS: the first, there are two later, but because of the audit, when out I do not know.
