"A number of reward items?"
<br><br>"What exactly will be the reward?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes lit up, even though she had been hurt many times by this broken system, she still had some expectations in her heart.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>When he looked at these several rewards clearly, his face instantly turned black.
<br><br>Because this reward is really too let him speechless.
<br><br>The rewards were actually all some books from his previous life.
<br><br>For example, "Nine Years Compulsory Education Teaching Book", "Sun Tzu's Art of War", "Dou Qi Hua Ma", "Martial Vault", "Douluo Continent", "The Raising of Poultry", "On Thirty-six Ways to Talk About Girls", "The Interpretation of Dreams by the Duke of Zhou", "One of the Four Strange Arts of Makeup", etc. ......
<br><br>In short, there are all sorts of types, big thousands of books.
<br><br>And in addition to that, there are also many copies of movies and anime from the previous world in the form of jade journals.
<br><br>What "The Legend of Nezha", "Journey to the West", "A Fistful of Bulls", "Pirate King", "The Battle of the Flood", "Scourge of the Witch and Demon", "One Hundred Thousand Whys", "Water Shadow Ninja" and many other works that were hot in previous generations, are also thousands of them. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Grass ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng a foul mouth directly burst out.
<br><br>The heart of 10,000 grass mud horse galloping.
<br><br>At this moment, he wanted to tear down this broken system.
<br><br>Where is the promised cultivation?
<br><br>Where is the promised reward from the first disciple?
<br><br>This is it?
<br><br>You can at least get some cultivation techniques martial arts!
<br><br>Yi Feng was completely speechless.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The good thing is that he is also counted in the system of the pit, experienced the big waves of people, skeleton Ben Wei such "the world's first expert" are made, still can not withstand this?
<br><br>So, he also quickly quiet down.
<br><br>After all, if you think about it, these books or animated movies, are considered very famous works of the past life, the future boredom does not have to just fight the landlord, at least you can also catch up with the novel nibble a drama.
<br><br>"Get up."
<br><br>Yi Feng picked up Su Yunyun, heart is also quite satisfied.
<br><br>Although the girl's attitude is a little wrong, but now after all is one of our own ah.
<br><br>Although still far from the goal of a hundred people, but now add this sister, it is considered four ah.
<br><br>Wait.
<br><br>Suddenly, Yi Feng sensed something was wrong.
<br><br>He suddenly recalled that the system just showed the progress of the mission is five people.
<br><br>That's not right.
<br><br>There were only four disciples who met the requirements, right?
<br><br>Was there a mistake?
<br><br>He hastily called out to the system.
<br><br>"Check the progress of the mission."
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Mission progress: number of disciples 5/100."
<br><br>There were really five?
<br><br>Seeing this system, Yi Feng was immediately dumbfounded.
<br><br>Although he had five disciples, but that Chi a bucket of press is not qualified ah.
<br><br>Could it be that there was some kind of change in Chi Yi Pail?
<br><br>The more you think about it.
<br><br>The more you think about it, the more likely it is.
<br><br>It seems that when we get back to the island, we have to give Chi Yat Bucket a new talent test.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Right now, he had other things to do, so he turned towards Qing Huan Xiang who was following him as well as Su Yun Yun Yun and said, "Old Qing, you take her back to the Heaven and Earth Sect first!"
<br><br>"Yes sir."
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang nodded his head.
<br><br>"Master, don't you want to go back?" Su Yunyun hurriedly asked.
<br><br>"I have some old friends who came back from overseas and called me for dinner, so I plan to stay at the martial school for two days, so you guys should go back first." Yi Feng laughed softly, while his gaze saw the butcher's bench across the room.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>That pork selling stall had reopened.
<br><br>"But, but ......"
<br><br>Su Yunyun wanted to say something but stopped.
<br><br>Some worries covered her face.
<br><br>Because with the hatred between her and Chen Yizhen, as well as Chen Yizhen's character, Chen Yizhen would definitely not give up on her.
<br><br>Even.
<br><br>In a short time, she would come in her real body.
<br><br>So in this situation, she did not want to leave the martial school, let alone leave Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Even if she had to leave, she wanted to have Yi Feng by her side.
<br><br>But Yi Feng is not around, and she has to leave the martial school, if Chen Yi Zhen's real body really kills ......
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Su Yunyun, and then smiled lightly.
<br><br>I did not expect this sister is still quite afraid of life.
<br><br>In fact, it is understandable, after all, to go to a new environment, fear of life is inevitable.
<br><br>For example, in his previous life, when he first went to college and enrolled in school alone, he also had this timidity.
<br><br>"Don't be afraid."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said comfortingly.
<br><br>"When you get to the Heaven and Earth Gate, there's Old Qing, and besides Old Qing, there are several of your senior brothers and sisters, they're all very good."
<br><br>"Okay, okay!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Su Yunyun could only nod respectfully.
<br><br>After settling down Su Yunyun, Yi Feng smiled and walked towards Old Wang Tau's house for a dinner appointment.
<br><br>On the other hand, Qing Huan Xiang took Su Yun Yun towards the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>On the road.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun was still filled with worry.
<br><br>Her enemy was an Immortal Emperor, and stepping out of the martial school always made her feel unsafe.
<br><br>Even though she could tell that Qing Huan Xiang was also strong, but after all, it wasn't Yi Feng and the martial school that could give her that strong sense of security.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>A small island ahead appeared in her eyes.
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang held a small boat and brought her towards the island.
<br><br>On the boat, she surveyed the scenery while watching the island.
<br><br>Although the scenery was nice, it didn't have the feeling of an overwhelming sect that she imagined.
<br><br>"Disembarkation."
<br><br>Qing Huan Xiang whispered.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Su Yunyun nodded lightly, withdrew her thoughts, and boarded the island.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The moment she boarded the island, she felt a steep change in the laws of heaven and earth around her.
<br><br>"This, this is?"
<br><br>"What a solidified space."
<br><br>"This gravity is also ......"
<br><br>"It's actually more advanced than the Immortal Realm."
<br><br>Her eyes widened in shock, filled with incredulity.
<br><br>As a Martial Emperor cultivator, she could have torn through space with her hands in the Immortal River Continent, but when she arrived on this island, it was difficult for her to even try to jump up.
<br><br>It's not that her cultivation disappeared, but the gravity and space on this island reached a certain level ......
<br><br>And more than that, she was shocked.
<br><br>After boarding the island on a city street, actually saw again the scene that appeared in Pingjiang City before.
<br><br>Per capita immortals.
<br><br>And the strength of the immortals here looked to be more than one level higher than that of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>In addition, from the time they entered the Heaven and Earth Gate, they also saw many incredible things.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>She realized that the worries in her heart were completely just redundant.
<br><br>She had completely just come from a safe place to another even safer place.
<br><br>Her heart was also considered completely relaxed.
<br><br>Staying in this place, I'm afraid that ten Chen Yizhen couldn't move a hair on her head.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>Her state of mind has also quietly changed.
<br><br>Originally, she always held herself as a Martial Emperor in her previous life, and always thought she was conceited because she possessed the Nine Revolutions Divine King Body.
<br><br>Now that she had come here, she realized how short-sighted her original gaze was.
<br><br>What is a Martial Emperor?
<br><br>What does Chen Yi Zhen count for?
<br><br>After joining the Heaven and Earth Sect, she will reach another peak, a peak that she didn't even dare to think about before.
<br><br>......
<br><br>The day.
<br><br>It was just a normal life.
<br><br>"Hey, this soap opera is really hard to watch, change it." Yi Feng was lying on the recliner of the Heaven and Earth Gate, brushing the drama with a jade slip in his hand while crossing his legs, in a good mood.
<br><br>Because since Su Yunyun, a few more big happy things happened.
<br><br>One is that he gave Chi a bucket to re-test the talent, this fatty actually really do not know what reason to reach the ordinary qualifications, here is equal to the insidious pick up a white to meet the system of disciples.
<br><br>Another is that the flyer given by the system some time ago did not pit him, after Su Yunyun, there are a few more disciples to pay respect to the master.
<br><br>Only ah.
<br><br>These disciples quite let him speechless.
<br><br>I thought they were all the kind of young people who were determined to go up and struggle for cultivation.
<br><br>But who knows, one by one unreliable.
<br><br>A waste than a waste.
<br><br>Some time ago, the system is not a gift of a large pile of books and jade slips from previous lives, he thought to give the book collection to the library, so that the book collection looks decent, so all these books moved to the book collection.
<br><br>This is a good fucking thing.
<br><br>These few new disciples are all hiding in the Book Depository to read novels and anime, the kind of meal are not eaten.
<br><br>On the contrary, that late a barrel looks the most reliable, every day will give him the whole night snack, this is not, recently put fried noodles also studied, Yi Feng can also change the taste to eat.
<br><br>But with this group of unreliable disciples, Yi Feng is still happy to relax.
<br><br>If they look for their own cultivation secrets, martial arts techniques and techniques, he really does not know how to solve.
