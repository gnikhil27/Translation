From a distance, Yin Jian fell inside the last pit, his body was broken into two by this punch, and he directly lost his life.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The atmosphere froze.
<br><br>The whole room was silent.
<br><br>Yin Jian.
<br><br>The old generation's genius figure, the most powerful sword cultivator in terms of attacking power.
<br><br>How could he be killed by that dead fish-eyed vulture with one punch?
<br><br>Everyone drew a cold breath and felt that their brains could not turn around.
<br><br>But on the contrary, that one ......
<br><br>Still sitting on the commode to take a shit.
<br><br>But he has put down the comic book in his hands, hands clenched fists, forehead veins exposed. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Seems like constipation is really bad!!!
<br><br>And after Yin Jian was instantly killed, the remaining Heavenly Spirit Sect crowd was finally panicked.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong led a group of people, the heart is already lost the fighting spirit.
<br><br>Dozens of people could not attack Su Yunyun, and now there is a strong bald oddball.
<br><br>But oddball is oddball, strong is really strong ah!
<br><br>And seriously injured, long ago retreated to the side of the battle circle Liu Ruyan, but also wide-eyed, for all that is happening in front of him, full of disbelief.
<br><br>Xiao Zhan.
<br><br>What in the end has he experienced?
<br><br>How in the world did he suddenly become a Golden Immortal?
<br><br>And those terrifying senior brothers and sisters of his ......
<br><br>One person blew himself up and destroyed the entire Law Enforcement Hall, one person and one sword fought alone against her master and the great elders of the Heavenly Spirit Sect without losing, and one person and one punch killed her senior uncle in seconds ......
<br><br>Where the hell did they come from?
<br><br>She bit her red lips to death.
<br><br>But just when everyone was in shock, Xiao Zhan several brothers and sisters were about to wipe out the entire Heavenly Spirit Sect, even Yin Tianxiong Liu Ruyan and others had lost their confidence. In the depths of the Heavenly Spirit Sect, a deep voice came out.
<br><br>"The old man has only been sleeping for ten thousand years, but I didn't expect someone to actually hit my Heavenly Spirit Sect."
<br><br>"Do you really think that the old man is dead and can't get up?"
<br><br>Once the voice fell, a vast aura spread majestically.
<br><br>The aura was so strong that it was like a ferocious beast that had been sleeping for many years suddenly awakened.
<br><br>Someone remembered something and fiercely exclaimed.
<br><br>"It's the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor."
<br><br>"What, the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor?"
<br><br>"My goodness, the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor is actually still alive?"
<br><br>The crowd exclaimed in shock.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Under a powerful aura wrap, a cloth-clad old man appeared.
<br><br>The aura crushed the entire field.
<br><br>"It's actually really the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor, I didn't expect that he was really alive, this Heavenly Spirit Sect's heritage is really powerful to the extreme!"
<br><br>"Then his strength, I'm afraid he's a First Turn Xuan Xian!"
<br><br>"First Turn Xuan Xian, really fortunate to still have seen such a legendary figure."
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Everyone in the room revealed awe.
<br><br>Xuan Xian and First Turn Xuan Xian, although there is only a difference of two words, the actual difference is heaven and earth.
<br><br>There is a good saying.
<br><br>Nine turns of Xuan Xian.
<br><br>One turn, one heaven, nine turns beyond the heavens.
<br><br>This foreshadows that the nine realms of the nine revolutions of the Xuan Xian have a huge gap, and the next realm after the nine revolutions is another new world.
<br><br>Although this statement is about the gap between the nine revolutions, it undoubtedly represents even more that there is an even greater gap between the ordinary Xuan Xian and the first revolution Xuan Xian.
<br><br>"The old ancestor."
<br><br>"The old ancestor actually did not sit down."
<br><br>"My Heavenly Spirit Sect, turned over."
<br><br>The appearance of the Heavenly Spirit Old Ancestor rekindled the hope of Yin Tianxiong and Liu Ruyan and the others, who knelt down and worshiped on the ground, revealing hot tears full of color.
<br><br>"Ten thousand years without appearing in the world, the Heavenly Spirit Sect has really regressed a lot, and was actually bullied by a few juniors, you guys are really useless!" Heavenly Spirit Old Ancestor looked at the Heavenly Spirit Sect which was riddled with holes and said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"Old ancestor, it's not that my grandson didn't try his best, it's just that these few people are too weird and evil!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong knelt on the ground, spitting out a stomach full of bitterness.
<br><br>Originally, it was also.
<br><br>At first it was ready to make momentum for Liu Ruyan, so as to further make the Heavenly Spirit Sect bigger.
<br><br>But Xiao Zhan had a change of heart, not to mention that the few brothers and sisters who came with him were more than one demon, and what's more, their strength and cultivation were not a standard at all.
<br><br>As a result, the whole plan failed, the Heavenly Spirit Sect also fell almost extinct.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"I'll teach you guys a lesson after I clean up these few little beasts."
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Old Ancestor let out a cold snort.
<br><br>A deep gaze was cast towards Su Yunyun Li Jin and the others, filled with killing intent.
<br><br>"Little beasts, since your respected elder did not discipline you well, then I, Ning Tianling, will take your lives in place of your respected elder."
<br><br>The thunderous voice of the old ancestor of the Heavenly Spirit shook the whole field, and with a big hand raised, the vast power was about to cover down.
<br><br>But before the palm of his hand fell, an abrupt voice suddenly rang out from the side.
<br><br>"Bah, you old bastard, where do you get the forced face to replace our venerable elder, do you have that qualification?"
<br><br>"Eat my Li person's sword first!"
<br><br>Li Jin shouted.
<br><br>The Heavenly Spirit Elder disdainfully inclined his head.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>His face changed violently and dramatically.
<br><br>High above him, with his majestic aura, his body uncontrollably rushed towards Li Jin who had drawn his long sword.
<br><br>With a boom.
<br><br>Kneeling on the ground, his hands went upward, catching the sword that Li Jin slashed at.
<br><br>This kneeling of the heavenly spirit old man.
<br><br>The eyes fell to the ground.
<br><br>The whole audience was in an uproar.
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong, who had just raised a bit of hope, had his veins exposed, his blood spurted, and he directly sat on his butt on the ground.
<br><br>The rest of the Heavenly Spirit Sect people, including Liu Ruyan, were also as white as paper and bloodless at this moment.
<br><br>Collectively, they were scared silly.
<br><br>A First Turn XuanXian Immortal, a Heavenly Spirit Ancestor, just appeared and kneeled?
<br><br>Everyone's head was dumbfounded.
<br><br>"You, you you, what kind of demonic technique is this?"
<br><br>The most shocked person was not the Heavenly Spirit Ancestor himself, he shouted out with his eyes wide open, his body was shivering, the aura that had just taken the world by storm had long disappeared, and there was only a dense fear in his eyes.
<br><br>No one was clearer than he was about what had just happened.
<br><br>It was as if a mysterious force had taken control of his body, even from a distance, he had to kneel over to catch this sword.
<br><br>"Hmph, this is a 100 percent empty-handed catch of the white blade."
<br><br>Li Jin raised his head and spoke out proudly.
