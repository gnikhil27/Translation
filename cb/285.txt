Boom!
<br><br>Just in the nick of time, there was a sudden burst of sound.
<br><br>But this sonic boom did not come from Firewalk's attack, but from his own storage ring.
<br><br>Also at the same time as the explosion, a dazzling red light appeared in front of his body.
<br><br>In the red light, there stood a human figure.
<br><br>He stretched out his arms and legs and stood in mid-air in a large figure.
<br><br>A large head topped with a small gourd, a square face, a pair of inverted eight eyebrows erected over gleaming eyes, clad in a small vest, angular, and a green leaf around his waist.
<br><br>"Ka!"
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>When Desolate Wuji saw this person, he was suddenly shocked.
<br><br>Because as a Martial Emperor he possessed a superb memory, he instantly remembered that this person in front of him was the same as the small wooden sculpture that Yi Feng had given him. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>To be more precise.
<br><br>The figure in front of him is the small wooden sculpture that Yi Feng gave him.
<br><br>Just when he was surprised that this wooden sculpture has such a function, more let him stare at the scene suddenly appeared.
<br><br>The gourd boy in front of his eyes suddenly grew bigger and turned into a monstrous giant, making the Desolate Wuji only able to see his heels at this moment.
<br><br>And in the face of Firewalker's killing move, the huge fireball shrouded in terrifying energy, in the hands of the giant that grew bigger just became a small thing, grabbed in one hand.
<br><br>Then threw it back towards Firewalker violently.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Only a miserable scream was heard, and Firewalker was killed directly under his own attack.
<br><br>Then, that gourd giant again, under the gaze of Desolate Wujing's staring eyes, directly carried a mountain next to it, raised it above his head, and violently smashed it towards the remaining Wood Row and Earth Row.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A shocking sound came out, the entire mountain range shook, and the two of them, Woodwalker and Earthwalker, were directly smashed at the bottom of the mountain, without even having the time to scream, before they were crushed into pieces.
<br><br>All this.
<br><br>It happened in just a moment.
<br><br>So that before Desolate Wuji could react, the three Firewalkers had already been extinguished to the point of no dregs left.
<br><br>Grunt.
<br><br>Desolate pathless swallowed a mouthful of saliva.
<br><br>Cold sweat ran down his forehead.
<br><br>As strong as he was, he was also shocked by this terrifying means.
<br><br>He could not understand how an insignificant small wooden sculpture actually emitted such a powerful power.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here?
<br><br>Ten thousand doubts appeared in his heart.
<br><br>Yi Feng is obviously just a mortal ah, how come the thing sent to him has such a monstrous power?
<br><br>Could it be that this old brother of mine is an expert who hides his strength?
<br><br>But it is not possible ah.
<br><br>If it is really an expert, they have been together for so many days, even the Ten Life Martial Emperors, it is impossible not to let him discover half of the end.
<br><br>Unless.
<br><br>This old brother of his is an immortal!
<br><br>However, this speculation, even more bullshit.
<br><br>Others may not know, but those who have stepped into the ranks of Martial Emperors actually know that the road to immortality in the Immortal River Continent has long been cut off.
<br><br>In other words.
<br><br>Today's Immortal River Continent, it is impossible for an immortal to appear, while the experts of the Immortal Realm, it is also impossible to come to the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>At that moment, the giant that had grown bigger shrunk abruptly, then turned back into a small wooden sculpture and landed at the bottom of Desolate Wujing's feet.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing picked up the small wooden sculpture and looked at it carefully, but found that it was cracked.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Looking at the cracked small wooden carving, Desolate Wuji guessed a possibility in his heart ......
<br><br>That is, this small wooden sculpture was left behind by a former immortal before the path to immortality was cut off, and then for some unknown reason, it fell to the mortal world.
<br><br>By mistake, it fell into the hands of Yi Feng, who then gave him the souvenir, which saved his life.
<br><br>And this explains exactly why the wooden carving cracked after functioning once.
<br><br>I am afraid that it is gradually losing its power in the long history, and the great display just now completely used up the power stored in its body.
<br><br>"Old brother, you are lucky, I wanted to send you something for self-preservation, but I didn't expect that the thing you sent me saved my life!"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji laughed to himself.
<br><br>However, this can be regarded as a good man having a good reward.
<br><br>If he hadn't given the jade pendant to Yi Feng, I'm afraid that Yi Feng wouldn't have given him this small wooden sculpture, let alone save his life because of it.
<br><br>Thinking through all this, he put away the small wooden sculpture, his eyes solemn again.
<br><br>Because the fire line three crisis is lifted, but he was in the killing array of the crisis can not be lifted.
<br><br>Time passed slowly.
<br><br>Bored Yi Feng leaned under a tree is already sleeping and woke up.
<br><br>But when he woke up, but found that Desolate Pathless and Yun Lang two people have not returned.
<br><br>Looking at such a big fog, Yi Feng's heart was worried.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he still decided to go look for Desolate Wuji.
<br><br>"You, stay where you are, don't go anywhere, if Old Brother Desolate and the others come back, you will wait here with them for me." Yi Feng instructed towards Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Aba ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei opened his upper and lower jaw, seeing Yi Feng glaring he hastily changed his mouth and responded, "Oh."
<br><br>See Bone Ben Wei agreed, Yi Feng only greeted the dog and walked towards the middle of the mist.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>He dared to walk into the fog without fear, also because of the dog. So even if you can't find it, the dog should be able to follow the scent back.
<br><br>Just like this, Yi Feng with the dog in the fog walk ah walk ......
<br><br>Finally, the dog came a bark.
<br><br>At the sound, Yi Feng hurriedly look around, immediately found in front of the hazy fog, standing in a person.
<br><br>Looking at its figure, it should be the desolate pathless.
<br><br>"Older brother."
<br><br>Yi Feng shouted at once.
<br><br>As a Martial Emperor strength, Desolate Wuji's five senses were sharp and he instantly heard Yi Feng's shout.
<br><br>He did not expect that Yi Feng had actually found him here.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>His face changed greatly.
<br><br>Because Yi Feng actually came towards him.
