Yun Changtian's expression froze.
<br><br>Looking down at his body, his eyes widened.
<br><br>"I just came out and it's gone like this?"
<br><br>He murmured in a dumbfounded manner.
<br><br>Boom.
<br><br>An explosive sound.
<br><br>His body exploded away under the raging force of a powerful force.
<br><br>Yun Changtian.
<br><br>POW!
<br><br>The rain of blood sprinkled all over Bai Shao, causing her to jolt and frighten her soul to death.
<br><br>Even though she had personally experienced it twice before, witnessing Yun Changtian's tragic state still hit her hard. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But in such a moment when she was lost in thought, the distant painting scroll, again, was a flash of light.
<br><br>Two pillars of light, once again locking onto her, came shooting from a distance.
<br><br>Even though the teleportation array was close at hand, Bai Shanyi was still scared out of her mind and rushed into the teleportation array like crazy.
<br><br>Finally, into the teleportation formation.
<br><br>The teleportation array fluctuates, white shallow one instantly teleported back to the white Yang true palace, and the teleportation array in the moment she returned to the white Yang true palace, also closed.
<br><br>Looking at the familiar everything of Bai Yang True Palace, as well as the familiar fresh air, Bai Shallow One breathed a sigh of relief and sat down helplessly on the ground.
<br><br>In her eyes, however, shone a monstrous hatred.
<br><br>She tang Bai Yang True Palace Goddess, the future successor of the True Palace, the first time out actually cost so much, a full loss of three lives.
<br><br>Such a loss was completely unacceptable to her.
<br><br>"I don't care what you are, I will make you pay ten times a hundred times the price, and I vow to kill you by a thousand cuts before I can relieve the hatred in my heart."
<br><br>White shallow one transmits a word by word, gnashing teeth ground voice.
<br><br>Eh?
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>She found something wrong with the slightest.
<br><br>She inclined her head to look at the far sky, eyelids suddenly jumped.
<br><br>Then she saw that two pillars of light broke through the air from the distant sky and locked directly onto him.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"They actually came after him across the border!"
<br><br>She stared with incredulous wide eyes.
<br><br>Never would have thought that these two pillars of light would actually chase directly to the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>The fear in her heart instantly rose up again, her body surging with immortal power, she exerted an unprecedented speed and rushed desperately towards the interior of Bai Yang True Palace.
<br><br>While running, the hysterical voice in his mouth once again came out.
<br><br>"Save me, Master save me!"
<br><br>The good thing was.
<br><br>This was, after all, within the White Sun True Palace's main camp, and as soon as the pillar of light appeared, there were many experts who sensed the terrifying aura.
<br><br>Boom.
<br><br>So at this moment, all over the White Sun True Palace, dozens of heavenly auras rose up, and many experts flew out of the sky.
<br><br>After they flew out, they caught a glimpse of Bai Shanyi, who was being chased by the pillar of light and was in a mess.
<br><br>"What a powerful attack, join hands to resist."
<br><br>The leader was the Patriarch of Bai Yang True Palace, Lu Zhengyi, who narrowed his eyes at the attacking pillar of light and immediately frowned.
<br><br>The power of that pillar of light made him feel frightened, so he did not dare to be arrogant and immediately ordered the crowd to join hands to resist.
<br><br>All the experts nodded, hand seals were struck in unison, and at the same time launched a palm towards the front.
<br><br>The attacks of dozens of people joined together and turned into an appalling shockwave that seemed to solidify and wrapped towards the pillar of light.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>Two powerful forces collided together.
<br><br>In the sky, a huge mushroom cloud immediately rose.
<br><br>The violent storm power spread out in all directions, and countless buildings of Baiyang True Palace were razed to the ground under the shock wave.
<br><br>And at the same time of spreading, the pillar of light disappeared in mid-air.
<br><br>But the many experts of Baiyang True Palace also did not suffer well, dozens of people grunted and flew backwards in unison, gliding thousands of feet in the sky before they were able to stabilize their bodies.
<br><br>"What kind of attack is this, it's so powerful, so many of us combined to resist this blow."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi frowned and hurriedly turned his gaze to Bai Shanyi who was limp on the ground.
<br><br>"Asahi, what the hell is going on?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi led the crowd to fall towards Bai Shanyi and asked with a frown, "Where are the two elders who went out with you?"
<br><br>"Master, please you must take revenge for me."
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi shook his body, red eyes full of hatred and said, "We met someone outside, he not only killed the two elders, even the three seals that the sect had sent down for me, but also used all of them."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You actually used up all three of your seals?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's face was ironic as he looked at Bai Shanyi's palm.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The three seals had become dull and lightless.
<br><br>"Who the hell is that?"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's face was ironic as he transmitted a one-word voice.
<br><br>Since the reopening of the Lingxu Realm, this was the first time that his Baiyang True Palace had entered the outside world, yet he returned with such heavy losses, which made it hard for him to accept.
<br><br>"I don't know what kind of person it is, but he doesn't even put our Bai Yang True Palace in his eyes, saying that killing our Bai Yang True Palace is like squashing a bedbug."
<br><br>"If it wasn't for the three seals plus the golden teleportation array you sent me, I'm afraid you wouldn't have been able to see your apprentice."
<br><br>"But even so, my apprentice was able to escape back and was already at the end of his rope."
<br><br>Bai Shanyi choked his voice and said with red eyes towards Lu Zhengyi and the others.
<br><br>"Good good."
<br><br>"Good one treats my Bai Yang True Palace like a mole, I want to see what kind of person is so arrogant!"
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi clenched his fist, his aura was revealed, mixed with thick anger.
<br><br>"Elders and above, Heavenly Immortal cultivators, leave some of them to guard the True Palace, the rest of you come out with me and meet this person."
<br><br>"I would like to see if he still has the capital to be arrogant in front of my Bai Yang True Palace."
<br><br>"Thank you, Master, please make sure you catch her and abolish his cultivation, so that I can torment him properly." Bai Shallow said with a malevolent look on her face.
<br><br>"Don't worry, Asahi-chan."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi softly comforted, "You as the most outstanding disciple of my Bai Yang True Palace, I will definitely not let you suffer for nothing, no matter who it is or what it is because of, he let you get hurt, then he will definitely die!"
<br><br>The voice fell, Lv Zheng raised his palm with one hand.
<br><br>Under the first appearance of golden light, a huge flying boat appeared in the sky.
<br><br>"Board the boat!"
<br><br>As his voice fell, dozens of experts flew onto the flying boat, each with a profound aura, the lowest of which had the cultivation of a Heavenly Immortal.
<br><br>This kind of lineup is terrifying.
<br><br>Even a casual walk out can sweep the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>"Asahi, you also come with me."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said, "Let you see how the people who bullied you tremble under the might of my Baiyang True Palace."
<br><br>"Master I ......"
<br><br>Bai Shanyi face subconsciously changed slightly, hesitant.
<br><br>To be honest, the fear that that pillar of light brought to her was not something that could dissipate overnight.
<br><br>"Don't worry, with me around, no one can hurt you."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi saw through Bai Shanyi's mind with a glance and solemnly reassured.
<br><br>"Also ......"
<br><br>Bai Shanyi's gaze moved slightly.
<br><br>Although she was the divine daughter of Bai Yang True Palace, but her strength was quite inferior to these elders, not to mention her master was also present.
<br><br>So with this kind of lineup, where would she be in any danger?
<br><br>Moreover, the painting had made her so miserable, if she did not see with her own eyes the person behind it begging for mercy on the ground, how could she be willing to do so?
<br><br>She followed many experts onto the flying boat.
<br><br>Soon.
<br><br>The flying boat like a stream of light shuttle away, according to the guidance of Bai Shanyi, towards Baier City ......
