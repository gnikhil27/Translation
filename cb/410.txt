"KAM!"
<br><br>Even though he passed the test, Yi Feng was still cursing.
<br><br>He really couldn't figure out why his talent stone would explode every time he tested his talent.
<br><br>It wasn't that he hadn't thought about whether his talent was too explosive for the talent stone to withstand?
<br><br>But the market circulation of some low-level techniques he also bought to try, but chicken feathers can not cultivate a.
<br><br>So far, he could only accept helplessly that he really had no cultivation talent.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked past the testing room and headed towards the area of those to be selected.
<br><br>"Another fish leaping over the dragon gate."
<br><br>"Envy, how come this person is not me."
<br><br>As before, there were countless people around the square, casting envious and awe-inspiring glances at Yi Feng, and there were even young girls dressed in revealing clothes throwing their eyebrows at Yi Feng.
<br><br>"This feeling is so enjoyable!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"This is what a man should look like!"
<br><br>Yi Feng bathed in this adoring gaze, making the gloom of detection just now also dissipated a lot.
<br><br>Could not help but squint his eyes, revealing a look of intent and enthusiasm.
<br><br>Perhaps he can also be respected by countless people in Pingjiang City, but that is his countless years of thoughtfulness for people in exchange, and most of them are a group of bad old ladies bad old men, which is comparable to this now, walking out and causing so many people to cheer ah.
<br><br>"Cultivator, so good."
<br><br>"I must become a cultivator!"
<br><br>Yi Feng tightened his fist and joined the ranks of those to be selected.
<br><br>Even though there were so many people lined up for testing, there were not many people waiting to be selected, and there were only about thirty people including Yi Feng.
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>North Sea Night Family.
<br><br>As one of the great families of the North Sea, there are countless experts inside, the family should have been full of vitality.
<br><br>But at the moment the night family is shrouded in a layer of death, the large mansion is full of decay, everywhere is empty, can hardly see a person.
<br><br>Only in the night family's martial arts arena, the last group of people gathered in the night family.
<br><br>At the head of the group was the head of the Night Family, Night Energy.
<br><br>He held his sword with both hands, the tip of which was stuck in the ground, while in middle age he had a ye white head, with white hair falling down from the sides at both temples, and his eyes were full of blood.
<br><br>"If you still want to leave, you can boldly leave, I night can never reproach."
<br><br>At this point, he spoke.
<br><br>"The night family is in, we are in."
<br><br>"If the Night Family dies, we all die!"
<br><br>Behind him, a neat voice came from the crowd, and not a single person retreated.
<br><br>Night Neng's body trembled and said gratefully, "The Night Family has you, no regrets, let us work together to face the incoming enemy!"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The crowd resolutely sounded out, sitting on the ground with their swords looking up at the sky, and then did not say a word.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>Outside the sky, two shadows appeared.
<br><br>The crowd saw this, the crowd in the hands of the long sword are a tremor, the light flowing, pupils also became sharp, ready to strike at any time.
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>"It seems to be Yi'er."
<br><br>Just when the crowd was ready to strike, Night Energy suddenly waved his hand and drank off the crowd.
<br><br>After saying that, he hurriedly raised his step to meet them.
<br><br>The two women landed, and it was none other than Ye Yi with her maid, Chun'er.
<br><br>"Greetings, Father."
<br><br>"Greetings to all the elders and uncles."
<br><br>Ye Yi hurriedly saluted.
<br><br>"Yi'er, why did you run back?"
<br><br>Seeing that it was really Ye Yi, an urgent questioning voice came from Night Energy.
<br><br>"Father, the family is in danger, as a son or daughter of the Night Family, how can I be greedy for life and death, I want to meet the enemy together with everyone." Ye Yi said solemnly.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>"What's the use of you coming back?"
<br><br>Night Neng coldly drank: "You hurry up and leave me, if you don't leave now, it will be too late by then."
<br><br>Saying that, Night Energy was about to start driving people away.
<br><br>"Father."
<br><br>Ye Yi, however, did not retreat halfway and said, "Are you prepared to let your daughter live in regret for the rest of her life, you have not even told me what the enemy is and let me go, have you thought about what I will endure in the future after I leave?"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Night can body trembling look at Ye Yi, sighing: "Yi'er ah, I do not want this, but I am also for your own good ah!"
<br><br>"Between one ye, the Noe family was dispatched, and I was driven away by you, but I still don't know what happened."
<br><br>Ye Yi said with a pale face, "Father, if you really did it for my own good, you should tell me what exactly has happened to my Night Family."
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>Night Energy heaved a sigh, looking at Ye Yi's tough look, he had to say, "It's all because, our Night Family was targeted by a mysterious organization."
<br><br>"The mysterious organization has targeted us?"
<br><br>Ye Yi hurriedly asked in surprise, "Why are they targeting us?"
<br><br>"They didn't say why, they only said that it was time for our Night Family to perish!"
<br><br>After saying that, Night Energy clenched his fist tightly.
<br><br>It could be seen how angry he was in his heart at this moment when he said these words.
<br><br>Without any reason, just one sentence saying that your night family should die and you will die, how domineering, how bullying, how not to put his night family in the eyes?
<br><br>Ye Yi was also stunned by this organization's approach, but she couldn't help but guess, "Could they just be scaring my Night Family?"
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>"They will do what they say they will do, the previous demise of the North Sea Fang family, the Yun family, was due to them." Night can say in a deep voice.
<br><br>Ye Yi's pretty face was white with shock.
<br><br>Never thought that the Fang family and the Yun family, which were exterminated by Yiye some time ago, were also the work of this organization.
<br><br>"Then what kind of organization are they?"
<br><br>Ye Yi couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Spiral!"
<br><br>"They call it spiral."
<br><br>"There are seven of them, each one of them has top Martial Emperor strength, and when they unite, it won't take much effort to exterminate any of the forces in the North Sea." Night Energy said gruffly.
<br><br>At these words, Ye Yi could not help but be shocked.
<br><br>No wonder, no wonder Night Neng forcefully asked her to leave, it was actually this kind of great enemy.
<br><br>Although her father was also a Martial Emperor, but how could he fight seven with one?
<br><br>The Night Family.
<br><br>Is it really going to die?
<br><br>Ye Yi had a miserable white face.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>She seemed to remember something.
<br><br>"Seven people ......"
<br><br>"All are Martial Emperors ......"
<br><br>Her mouth murmured urgently as a bold guess surfaced in her heart.
<br><br>In order to verify the idea in her mind, she asked urgently towards Night Energy, "Father, this spiral you mentioned is wearing black robes, and the one at the head has a scar on his face?"
<br><br>"Not bad, but how do you know that?"
<br><br>Night Neng glanced at Ye Yi and asked in shock.
<br><br>Seeing Night Energy say that, Ye Yi instantly relaxed and her red lips slightly raised, looking at the crowd and saying meaningfully, "Father, all the elders and uncles, I think I can bring you a good news."
<br><br>"What good news?"
<br><br>Night Energy frowned and couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>The other people of the Night Family also looked over one after another.
<br><br>"The one you guys are talking about, the spiral, is dead!"
<br><br>Ye Yi passed out a solemn voice.
