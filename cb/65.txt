"Between us, there's nothing to say."
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't want to say one more word to her, and directly walked past her on the wrong side.
<br><br>"Stand still."
<br><br>"Do you want to leave so easily after subjecting me to such a great humiliation that day?" Peng Ying said coldly.
<br><br>"Then what do you want?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>"I don't want anything." Peng Ying said coldly and mockingly, "I just want to tell you that you, will always be just a trash living at the bottom, while I, am a disciple of the Castle Peak Sect, a cultivator, you will never be worthy of me."
<br><br>The conversation between Yi Feng and Peng Ying immediately drew the attention of many people.
<br><br>No matter what kind of people, they couldn't stay away from gossip.
<br><br>"A mole like you, all you deserve in life is to keep that broken martial school of yours and live at the bottom, and you won't even have a woman to look at."
<br><br>Peng Ying mocked word by word bead by heart. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>All this was her way of paying back the insult she had received that day at the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce.
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>However, just as her voice fell, a slap landed on her face.
<br><br>The person who hit her was none other than Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>Hearing Peng Ying so humiliate the person she admired in her heart, she just couldn't hold back and stood out.
<br><br>"A frog at the bottom of the well, the literary skills of a gentleman are something you can question, even if you are a cultivator, so what?" Mao Yun'er shot back without any mercy.
<br><br>"Who are you?"
<br><br>Being slapped, Peng Ying was hysterical, and his hateful gaze stared deadly at Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>"Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, Mao Yun'er."
<br><br>Mao Yun'er said bluntly.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"It's actually Mao Yun'er?"
<br><br>"I heard that not only is she an outstanding writer, but she is also the jewel of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce!"
<br><br>"It's really better to be known than to see, it's really the posture of everyone, just why would she stand up for this chilling youth?"
<br><br>For a time, the young talents beside the onlookers revealed surprised voices, casting a gaze onto, Mao Yun'er's body.
<br><br>Obviously, Mao Yun'er, as the pearl of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, had long been famous.
<br><br>"Mao Yun'er of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce?"
<br><br>Peng Ying clutched her face and sent out a gloomy voice.
<br><br>She couldn't figure out why Mao Yun'er would stand up for Yi Feng and would stand up for her in front of this abandoned man.
<br><br>So, she drank unwillingly, "So what if you are from the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, between me and him, what business is it of yours, and what is your relationship with him?"
<br><br>"I have nothing to do with him, I'm just a fan of Mr. Supreme Treasure." Mao Yun'er said reluctantly, while turning back towards Yi Feng, "Sir, with me here, no one dares to say a bad word about you."
<br><br>"Many thanks."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded towards him, his face slightly complicated.
<br><br>He didn't like this feeling of being watched, if he had known, he wouldn't have come.
<br><br>"Fan?"
<br><br>Mao Yuner's words stirred up a bad memory for Peng Ying.
<br><br>It was the fans again.
<br><br>When Luo Lanxue expelled him from the sect, wasn't it because of the Supreme Treasure?
<br><br>The book written by a bottom mole was so attractive?
<br><br>A broken book, what makes it so influential?
<br><br>Peng Ying could not figure out.
<br><br>Even if a good book is written, it is only written by mortals, and there is a huge gap with cultivators.
<br><br>"I don't care what you are, this is between me and him, I'm warning you, get out of my way right now." Under the absolute hatred, Peng Ying coldly transmitted a threatening voice towards Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>At the same time, her long sword was drawn and the aura of a ninth level martial artist on her body was exposed.
<br><br>So what if the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, although she is now expelled from the Castle Peak Sect, but because of Yu Wujie's relationship, she can immediately return, with the Castle Peak Sect behind her, mortal chambers of commerce are nothing more than molehills.
<br><br>Therefore, the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, she is not afraid of.
<br><br>Therefore, she had no qualms about using her cultivation qi to force her way towards Mao Yun'er.
<br><br>In a flash, Mao Yun'er's face turned white.
<br><br>Although she is the pearl of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, but is only a mortal, in front of cultivators, can not withstand half the pressure.
<br><br>And other onlookers of the literary youth, have also been this aura to suppress the back one after another.
<br><br>They were ordinary people after all.
<br><br>"Pop!"
<br><br>However, just then, another slap smacked on Peng Ying's face, and then a woman with an extreme figure appeared in front of Peng Ying.
