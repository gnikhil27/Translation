"This sword, it seems to be the one of the woman I killed before."
<br><br>"It seems that this person, who is related to that woman, should not be kept even more then."
<br><br>After descending to the ground, he looked at Yi Feng with a face full of killing intent.
<br><br>The figure moved.
<br><br>He struck with a killing move, without the slightest reservation, and instantly closed in on Yi Feng.
<br><br>But just at that moment.
<br><br>He was surprised to find that the laws of heaven and earth in the surrounding space seemed to have changed in some way.
<br><br>The original humanoid state shifted and turned into the origin state.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>He was greatly alarmed in his heart.
<br><br>However, at this moment, he who was in an attacking position did not care that much, after all, the arrow was already on the string. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Moreover, turning into the origin state did not affect his combat power.
<br><br>Because for any demon beast, the origin state is instead the strongest state.
<br><br>Feeling the ground behind him swaying, Yi Feng only slowed down with hindsight, there was a behemoth attacking towards him.
<br><br>"What a big buffalo."
<br><br>Yi Feng was astonished.
<br><br>Surprised at the same time eyes also slightly bright.
<br><br>I was worried about finding something to give his apprentice, did not expect so quickly sent to the door.
<br><br>That will be accepted.
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his lips, facing the incoming buffalo, holding up his sword instead of retreating.
<br><br>"It's actually a human mortal!"
<br><br>"Really don't know what's good for you."
<br><br>Feeling the aura on Yi Feng's body, and this stance of raising his sword, he instantly judged that Yi Feng was no expert.
<br><br>This filled his heart with disdain.
<br><br>But just as the disdain rose, his entire huge body was stunned in place.
<br><br>Then fell to the ground with a bang, staring at those big eyes, eyes filled with intense disbelief.
<br><br>This mortal, what happened?
<br><br>How is this possible?
<br><br>That mediocre sword, how did it directly break his defense?
<br><br>"Hmph, although I can't cultivate, but I can still kill a cow of yours." Looking at the might of his sword, Yi Feng held up his sword and said with a stinky face.
<br><br>These words.
<br><br>It directly made the huge body lying on the ground, choke on a mouthful of blood.
<br><br>With the life flowing from his body, the last trace of his consciousness disappeared.
<br><br>How about getting some fresh beef to eat?
<br><br>Thinking of this, Yi Feng said to move, but approached a smell, but found that the cow surprisingly stinky, which made Yi Feng full of disgust shook his head.
<br><br>"Forget it, let's take its essence!"
<br><br>A sword, this buffalo's big baby cut off, and then wrapped up with leaves.
<br><br>Weighed it.
<br><br>It was really fucking big.
<br><br>Enough for his master and disciple a big meal.
<br><br>After wiping the blood off his sword, he was lucky enough to quickly find the needed herbs again, and then returned to the cave.
<br><br>In the cave.
<br><br>The woman in white was sitting on the ground, with her eyes closed, very nice.
<br><br>Noticing Yi Feng's return, she opened her beautiful eyes.
<br><br>However, her expression was a bit uncomfortable, obviously remembering what happened before, and also a bit embarrassed.
<br><br>"Well, the herbs got back, I'll put it on you!"
<br><br>Yi Feng crushed the herbs with one hand, while saying.
<br><br>The woman opened her mouth and wanted to refuse to say she came, but the words came to her lips but she did not say it.
<br><br>For some reason, she was afraid that Yi Feng would scold her.
<br><br>After helping the woman in white apply the herbs, Yi Feng built a fire and took out a rabbit for barbecue at the same time.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>The woman in white opened her eyes and asked.
<br><br>"Man is iron and rice is steel, you have to eat something, right?" Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"I suggest you should forget it." The white-clothed woman gently reminded, "The smell will attract a lot of things, and it's not even impossible to attract demonic beasts."
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>Yi Feng panicked.
<br><br>The woman in white nodded solemnly.
<br><br>Looking at her solemn appearance, Yi Feng subconsciously shivered, this is how he ate all the way over ah, think of their own luck.
<br><br>Fortunately, he bought a lot of local specialties in Nansha, since the barbecue can not be, can only use these to fill the stomach.
<br><br>"By the way, haven't asked your name?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Yun Yaoyao."
<br><br>The woman in white said.
<br><br>"Well, Miss Yun Yaoyao." Yi Feng nodded and then asked, "By the way, what exactly beat you up like this?"
<br><br>"A Six Destiny Emperor level Bull Demon!" Yun Yoyo solemnly said.
<br><br>"Six lives emperor level?"
<br><br>The name sounded so awesome that Yi Feng couldn't help but ask, "This should be quite a bit more powerful than a Martial Spirit, right?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao couldn't help but glance at Yi Feng.
<br><br>Quite a bit helplessly shook his head.
<br><br>I'm afraid that in this mortal's eyes, the most powerful thing was also a Martial Spirit.
<br><br>"Martial spirits are nothing more than ants in his eyes." Yun Yaoyao explained, thought of something, then added: "I suggest we should not move around next, to act also wait for me to recover from my injury."
<br><br>"Why?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Inside the mountain today, it's more complicated than you think." Yun Yoyo said with a gloomy expression: "This hundred thousand mountains, there should not be such a demon, originally cooped up here the most powerful is only a demon daddy."
<br><br>"But there is an immortal relic inside this mountain, because this immortal relic is about to come out, so many experts have rushed to this hundred thousand mountains."
<br><br>"And the Bull Demon Demon Emperor who injured me was the one who rushed over from the Western Demon Forest in the west of the continent."
<br><br>"So you are also for this immortal relic?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Not bad."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao nodded frankly.
<br><br>"Okay, by the way, what is the West Demon Forest again?" Yi Feng asked, puzzled again.
<br><br>"The continent is divided into five places, the Northern Sea, the Western Demon Forest, the Southern Wasteland, the Eastern Victory Continent, and the Central Continent."
<br><br>"The northern sea frozen land, few people."
<br><br>"The South Barren Land, with few people and extensive land, but the experts there are generally powerful."
<br><br>"The West Demon Forest is a gathering place for demonic beasts, a paradise for demonic beasts."
<br><br>"The Eastern Victory is the most populous territory, but the strength here is not uniform."
<br><br>"As for the Middle Continent, it is the land of the strongest people in the entire continent, gathering the experts of the entire continent." Yun Yaoyao explained towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Having lived for so long, he realized that this continent was divided into so many regions.
<br><br>"That Bull Demon came from a place like the Western Demon Forest, it seems to be really scary!" Yi Feng said gruffly, "I really hope I don't run into him, or I won't be able to run away."
<br><br>"If you run into him ......"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo glanced at Yi Feng, sighed and said, "It's better to seek your own luck!"
