 It was within a courtyard.
<br><br>This was a temporary stronghold for the Xuanwu Sect after they came to Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Inside the hall.
<br><br>It was quiet to the extreme.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu sat at the top with a gloomy face, while Demon Ling'er and the other senior officers also sat by the side without saying a word, all waiting for news of the dead soldiers sent out.
<br><br>"Master, do you think he will be able to successfully return?" Finally, Demon Ling'er couldn't sit still any longer, knitted her pretty eyebrows and stood up to ask.
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu still did not say a word.
<br><br>But in his heart, he also had no bottom.
<br><br>During the time that the dead man went to scout for information, he calmed down a lot, and he thought a lot.
<br><br>Although he is the master, but from the bottom of his heart he understands that the two disciples, Jing Wu Chen and Jing Wu Feng, are more talented than him, far beyond his youth, and now has reached the Martial Spirit realm.
<br><br>Martial Spirit. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>In the entire South Sand, it is also an existence that cannot be underestimated.
<br><br>In addition, with the Heaven-shaking Stone and the Swift Cloak in hand, as long as one does not encounter the kind of old monsters who have stepped into the Martial King for many years, one actually has a chance of escape.
<br><br>In other words, to kill the two of them, even if he personally took action, it would not be easy.
<br><br>However, the two were in that person's hands, but their corpses were not survived.
<br><br>In addition.
<br><br>The Zhentian Stone and the Swift Cloak, as imperial treasures, not to mention the existence of Martial Kings, even Martial Emperors treated them as supreme treasures, why was that person so unconcerned?
<br><br>Just simply to humiliate his Xuanwu Sect?
<br><br>Unlikely, after all, these are two imperial treasures.
<br><br>The biggest possibility is that that person really did not put the Heaven-shaking Stone and Swift Cloak in his eyes.
<br><br>Once these two logical points are thought of, that person's strength is at least an old Martial King who has broken through for many years, more likely to be a Martial Emperor, or possibly even a Martial Sage above a Martial Emperor ......
<br><br>But whether it is that case, he Ning Xuanwu do not have much certainty to face.
<br><br>A thought to this.
<br><br>His face became even more gloomy.
<br><br>At the same time, also do not think that the dead soldier can return unharmed.
<br><br>Seeing Ning Xuanwu's appearance, the hall fell into silence once again, and the faces of the people were all gloomy.
<br><br>Obviously, Ning Xuanwu can figure out this problem, the crowd can also think.
<br><br>That dead soldier, the probability is not going to return.
<br><br>However, just when the morale of the crowd was low, the subordinate came directly to report: "Report to the patriarch, Xu Kun has returned."
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the crowd's faces were stagnant as they rose in unison to rush outside.
<br><br>This news was simply an unexpected pleasure for them!
<br><br>Sure enough, when they arrived at the door, they saw Xu Kun, who had been sent as a deadly soldier, and at this moment, the corners of his mouth were outlined with a smile, and he was still quite proud of himself.
<br><br>This line.
<br><br>Really successful ah!
<br><br>Not only was there no danger, but it also allowed him to jump from the Dragon Gate and become a personal disciple in one fell swoop.
<br><br>"How is it?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu and the others greeted him anxiously and hurriedly asked towards him.
<br><br>"Greetings, Sovereign, Greetings, Elders, I am fortunate." Xu Kun said with a smile on his face towards the crowd, "We've poked around clearly, that person doesn't have any strength, he's just an ordinary mortal."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>At these words, the crowd revealed an incredulous look, this scouting back information and their guesses gap, is too much ah!
<br><br>"You're not lying?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu frowned, and then with a hint of pressure enveloped towards Xu Kun.
<br><br>"Disciple dares to swear on his life, absolutely no lie, so there must be some misunderstanding about the death of the two senior brothers, the two Pure and Dustless, and even I suspect that they are not dead yet." Under Ning Xuanwu's might, Xu Kun hurriedly raised his palm and said, then told what happened in the martial school, one by one.
<br><br>At these words, the crowd also nodded their heads in unison.
<br><br>So it seems that things should really be as Xu Kun shrink said.
<br><br>"A mortal, actually a mortal."
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu's fists clenched tightly as an angry aura erupted from his body.
<br><br>He did not expect that the object of their battle of wits for so long would actually be a tiny mortal, which was simply a shame to him.
<br><br>"Since that's the case, then I will personally take action and directly slap him to death, whether he is a blindfold made by the Castle Peak Sect or not, I will tell him to fly into oblivion."
<br><br>After a cold laugh, Ning Xuanwu swept out with a face full of anger and headed for the martial school.
<br><br>Seeing this, the others also swept up.
<br><br>......
<br><br>......
