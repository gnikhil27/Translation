Nine dragons whistled in the nine heavens.
<br><br>It surged toward the three armored men.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When the three men saw this, their faces changed greatly.
<br><br>Because the nine dung dragons were actually directly locked on them, carrying a cloying power to impact.
<br><br>Before they had time to set up an effective defense, the nine dragons had already impacted on them.
<br><br>The old ten, who kicked the dung bucket away, was the first to bear the brunt, with seven of the nine dragons locked onto him.
<br><br>Under the diffusion of the dung water, it went up in smoke on the spot.
<br><br>"Ah!!!"
<br><br>The other two came out with miserable shrieks and flew straight backwards, smashing on top of a mountain range tens of miles away.
<br><br>"Boom!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The mountain range collapsed with a bang, and the two of them sank deep inside the ruins and were seriously injured.
<br><br>"Good, what a terrifying power!"
<br><br>Old Nine braced himself and climbed up with difficulty.
<br><br>"Old Ten, Old Ten is gone, what the hell is this?" Old eight also climbed up from the mud with difficulty, gritting his teeth.
<br><br>"Must report the boss, this island is really unusual!"
<br><br>Lao Jiu said solemnly.
<br><br>This is not even on the island, but directly lost one person, simply beyond their imagination.
<br><br>Thinking back to the horrific attack just now, they still had palpitations.
<br><br>And at this moment, the two of them are not to mention the injuries, just the stench of their bodies smoked them close to fainting, as if every pore of their bodies were covered with shit scum.
<br><br>The two of them re-staggered and flew up, rushing towards the location of the exterminator and others.
<br><br>"Several lords, wait at ease can, those three lords personally, will certainly horse to become ......"
<br><br>The exterminator patted his horse's back.
<br><br>But no sooner had he finished speaking than he saw two figures from outside the sky flying back shakily, and with them came a pungent stench.
<br><br>He was dumbfounded.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The armoured man at the head of the group sank at the sight and led the crowd to rush towards the two men to meet them.
<br><br>"Big, big brother!"
<br><br>Old Eight and Old Nine shouted hysterically.
<br><br>"What the hell is going on with you guys?"
<br><br>"Where is Old Ten?"
<br><br>The man at the head of the group asked urgently.
<br><br>"Old Ten, Old Ten he has ......"
<br><br>Old Eight and Old Nine had a sad face, and only under the puzzled gaze of the crowd did they tell the whole story of what had just happened.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>The crowd was shocked.
<br><br>"You mean that you were beaten by a manure picker and killed and injured before you even boarded the island?"
<br><br>The man in armor at the head of the group stared in disbelief, his eyes full of disbelief.
<br><br>"Big brother, it says it's a dung carrier, but it's ridiculously strong!"
<br><br>Old Eight said with a sobbing face, "You must take revenge for Old Ten!"
<br><br>"Okay, I know."
<br><br>The leader of the armor man frowned, said in a deep voice: "I know what to do next, you guys go heal first!"
<br><br>"Of course more important is to wash first."
<br><br>After saying that, he couldn't help but cover his nose.
<br><br>After Old Eight and Old Nine retreated, the others gathered around.
<br><br>"Big brother, what should we do?"
<br><br>"You must take revenge for Old Ten!"
<br><br>"Yes, we can't just let Old Ten die like this!"
<br><br>The voices of the crowd came one after another.
<br><br>The armoured man at the head of the group interrupted them with a wave of his palm.
<br><br>"This island!"
<br><br>"It's not simple."
<br><br>"If we venture to fight up there, not to mention completing the mission given to us by the messenger, I'm afraid we'll all have to repeat the same mistake Old Ten made!"
<br><br>He said in a deep voice.
<br><br>These words fell.
<br><br>Let the hearts of the people sink.
<br><br>"Then the boss, what to do, there must be a way ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, boss!"
<br><br>"We can't just go back like this, right?"
<br><br>The voices of the crowd came out one after another.
<br><br>The leader of the man pondered, long and long before saying, "It is not appropriate to attack strongly, first poking around the island is the main."
<br><br>"So, we can only use that method!"
<br><br>"Can you remember the method of illusion that the messenger taught us?"
<br><br>"What do you mean, boss?"
<br><br>The crowd exclaimed.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>"Although this is the next best thing, but there is a saying that knowing oneself and one's enemy is the only way to win a hundred battles. Only by prying into what this island is like, we can know how to attack this island."
<br><br>The crowd nodded their heads at the words.
<br><br>Even if the heart is reluctant, but think of the island did not go up, lost one person, seriously injured two people, also know that can only do so.
<br><br>"Wait two days, when Old Eight and Old Nine recover from their injuries, then activate the Illusionary Formation!"
<br><br>Two days of time.
<br><br>Soon passed.
<br><br>Exterminating the world and others, hibernating and not moving.
<br><br>When the old eight and the old nine are well a seven or eight, the woods, the crowd gathered.
<br><br>An illusionary spell formation in front of the eyes has also long been set up.
<br><br>The leader of the armor man, towards the crowd solemnly explained.
<br><br>"Old Ten's death, everyone remember, the only way to get revenge for Old Ten is to poke around the island first!"
<br><br>"And by activating the illusion method, we will be able to infiltrate the island without much effort."
<br><br>"Because of the illusion method, our bodies are not affected by the formation and mental attacks, and our defense is greatly enhanced, even the strongest experts cannot see through our original bodies, which is equivalent to having an immortal and indestructible body, so we can greatly investigate all parts of the island."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The crowd solemnly answered.
<br><br>After explaining to the crowd, nine people walked into the arranged illusion formation.
<br><br>As they walked in, the light flickered, and they saw the nine people directly transform into nine bee-sized flying insects.
<br><br>If you look closely.
<br><br>Can find their bodies are thickly wrapped in armor, like a metal shell, tough and unbreakable.
<br><br>A buzzing sound came out.
<br><br>One of them emitted a voice.
<br><br>"Wait a moment to go up to the island in nine directions, and when you get to the island, each check out their own area, where there are formations, where there are experts, where there are key items that concern qi, write them down, and then rendezvous at the lake on the south side of the island, and then come back together."
<br><br>"When you come back, report the situation to the messenger, then make a plan to trample the island and avenge Old Ten!"
<br><br>"Is that understood?"
<br><br>"Understood!"
<br><br>Neat voice came out, eight flying insects with the speed of light, quickly fly out.
<br><br>The man in the lead flew to the front of the exterminator.
<br><br>The exterminator had long been stunned by this tactic.
<br><br>"My Lord, what are your orders?" Perisher said respectfully.
<br><br>"Remember, you have to protect this illusion formation, if the illusion formation is destroyed, we will not be able to return to itself, so no matter what, you will not be able to leave one step."
<br><br>The head man explained solemnly.
<br><br>"I understand, please rest assured, my lord, I will protect the spell properly!"
<br><br>Perdition nodded solemnly.
<br><br>"En, I'll leave this place to you, die here and wait for our return!" The man said.
<br><br>"My lord, don't worry, I will not leave until you guys return."
<br><br>"Die waiting!!!"
<br><br>Extinction clenched his fist, solemnly out.
