After one wave, Yi Feng had used up almost all of his Qi points.
<br><br>He watched his gaze with a black face.
<br><br>In the next moment, a house that was too familiar to be seen appeared flat on the ground.
<br><br>Yi Feng rubbed his eyes.
<br><br>He found that he did not see it wrong.
<br><br>"Grass!" He stomped his foot and roared, "Grass ah me grass, the dog system really pitted me!!!"
<br><br>"This is the house you gave me??"
<br><br>"My own house still need you to give?
<br><br>"Dog system you go to hell!!!"
<br><br>It took a while for Yi Feng to finish his anger, he pounded his chest, chagrined!
<br><br>It was hard to slow down from the anger, Yi Feng looked at the martial arts school in front of him where he had lived for many years.　　Gritting his teeth almost directly angry to ascend to heaven. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This is the house that he spent all his qi luck points to exchange?
<br><br>He redeemed his own house with qi luck points.
<br><br>He expected that he would be pitted, but he did not expect the pit to be so outrageous.
<br><br>What's more, he didn't expect that not only would he be pitted, but he would also be pitted so much that he almost passed out.
<br><br>After half a day, all the Qi luck points were used up, but the result was only his own martial arts school. And there is nothing in this martial arts school.
<br><br>He usually used to eat, painting, writing, carving. Put in the house of the same thing did not cash over.
<br><br>After yelling at his father and cursing his mother, Yi Feng thought of something. Open the system store.
<br><br>Under a closer look, it is true, the store is also divided into one, two, three ......
<br><br>Store one, is the interface of the party's own exchange.
<br><br>As for store two, all the usual in the mortal world when they do it by hand.
<br><br>What painting ah, carved objects ah, made weapons ah ......
<br><br>The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are not able to get a lot of money from the internet.
<br><br>It's great.
<br><br>Yi Feng gasped and laughed, praising: "System you are awesome."
<br><br>He looked down at the toad lying on the back of his feet sleeping on all fours.
<br><br>Between lightning and fire in his brain, he remembered something.
<br><br>The backyard of his martial arts school ...... had a well. He often threw the skeleton Ben Wei into the well ......
<br><br>It seems that there is such an ...... identical toad ......
<br><br>Yi Feng closed the store, he really did not want to look at the things in the store three.
<br><br>He was afraid that he really had to gas over.
<br><br>He closed his eyes, looked up to the sky and took a deep breath, and then slowly exhaled.
<br><br>A foot flew up!
<br><br>Kicked the toad on his foot out!
<br><br>An arc streaked through the wind filled with yellow sand, and the toad disappeared in the air.
<br><br>The gale blew Yi Feng messy.
<br><br>For a while, he looked at the gale sweeping black clouds over the dark shadow island, and exhaled a foul breath.
<br><br>"The world is so beautiful, don't be cranky. Don't be cranky ......"
<br><br>After saying that, he turned around and walked into the martial arts school.
<br><br>It was still the same familiar house.
<br><br>But only the martial arts school, as for the backyard of the martial arts school, that is not at all.
<br><br>The floor of the house was filled with various seeds and saplings.
<br><br>These are Yi Feng party together from the store exchange.
<br><br>He took the sapling seeds all up.
<br><br>If who these things told him from his heaven and earth door back mountain redemption, he would not be surprised.
<br><br>Yi Feng's picked house location is very good, in the entire Shadow Island is leeward, a high hill. The hill behind the wind, is where he prepared to sow the seeds.
<br><br>The next day is to dig the ground and turn the soil, pick water to wet the soil, cut wood to repair.
<br><br>For him, this island except the weather is almost, the wind sweeping yellow sand all day long, never see the sun. Other than that, it was fine.　　As for the water, in addition to the darker color, there are no side effects.
<br><br>After all, fed slowly for a long time, no problems at all.
<br><br>Half a month passed, Yi Feng will be the store to exchange the seeds of saplings to get, cut the wood to make a fence, the whole back of the hill are enclosed, as the backyard of the house.
<br><br>Another day, Yi Feng in addition to the weeds in the backyard, watching the seeds have the appearance of breaking the soil, watered well, and only then returned to the house to rest.　　"Ha ......" Yi Feng yawned and lay down on the bed.
<br><br>These days he was busy with the yard alone, and now that it's all done, he remembered that he hadn't seen the store three.
<br><br>He hesitated, but could not resist his curiosity and opened the system's qi store three to take a look.
<br><br>Yi Feng turned over on the bed and changed to a comfortable position.
<br><br>When he swept through the items in Store 3, his eyes lit up.
<br><br>He sat up from the bed with a jolt.
<br><br>Store Three: Randomly teleport to any location in the Immortal World, Qi Luck Points required: 1000 points.
<br><br>"Yikes! A chance to exchange out directly!"
<br><br>He was pleasantly surprised, "Then I can cross the Black River without preparing three years of rations and slowly together!"
<br><br>Yi Feng jumped up with his fist in the air.
<br><br>Then his eyes fell on two of the words.
<br><br>"Random ......"
<br><br>He muttered, when it was passed to the immortal world, also said random it ......
<br><br>rely on unreliable ah this thing ......
