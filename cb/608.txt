<br><br>"It seems that our knowledge is shallow, this talk is coming while Master Bones, simply terrifying!"
<br><br>"This kind of strength, tsk!"
<br><br>Just finished speaking, the palm of his hand grabbed them and pulled them towards the void.
<br><br>In an instant.

<br><br>But in a moment.
<br><br>The three brothers were brought to another scene.
<br><br>Here Qionglou jade building.
<br><br>Singing and dancing.
<br><br>The smell of pure fragrant wine everywhere, the smell of wine alone, a deep breath, it is as if a person's realm smooth a lot.
<br><br>All around, from time to time, there are silk-clad fairies floating past.
<br><br>They are the maids of honor here.
<br><br>However, just the maids, let the brother three can not see the realm.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This is the number one flower tower in the immortal world, the Green Sky White Jade Tower!?"
<br><br>Brother three were stunned by the scene in front of them.
<br><br>I drop a God ah.
<br><br>This instantly actually by the skeleton moncler, from the big competition site, to this legendary first flower building.
<br><br>The three brothers were like country bumpkins entering a village, curiously observing the surroundings.
<br><br>The first flower house in the immortal world is definitely not a false rumor out.
<br><br>The people who can come here to spend money are all the giants.
<br><br>Because even the maids here are at least Xuan Xian realm, although the three brothers come from a good background, but it is also the first time to come here.
<br><br>After a moment of stagnation, the three this noticed the five masters next to them.
<br><br>"Li Tian, Li Di, Li Ren, meet Grand Master Bones, Grand Master Dog, Grand Master Night Wind, Grand Master Milk Dose, Grand Master Spirit King!"
<br><br>The three people hurriedly kneeled down, respectfully out, looking at the top hand two fairies of a bone, a centipede, a dog, a bear, and a soul body.

<br><br>"Got it grandpa."
<br><br>The three men were too excited to calm down.
<br><br>Qingtian Baiyu Building ah.
<br><br>This is the Qingtian Baiyu Building ah.
<br><br>This random lady is Xuan Xian level, this time if not follow the skeleton master, usually where they can have this opportunity?
<br><br>The first time.
<br><br>The box was filled with songs.
<br><br>Especially the bones, but also high to fall apart.
<br><br>This high.
<br><br>It is a night.
<br><br>Heavenly House three high are about to deflate, the bones of the master is still screaming to continue to play music, continue to dance.

<br><br>"10% discount good, 10% discount good, this scum will pay later, you guys go out first!" Bone Ben Wei waved his hand without a care and said.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The pimp finally breathed a sigh of relief when he saw this and led the girls away.
<br><br>While the three people of the Heavenly Kingdom on the side were wide-eyed.
<br><br>Ninety million immortal dollars.
<br><br>A full 90 million immortal stones!
<br><br>I'm afraid that only a person like Grand Master Bones could afford to spend here!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They were in the middle of their worship when they noticed that Skeleton Ben Wei turned his smiling gaze towards them.
<br><br>"What are you, Grand Master Bones?"
<br><br>The three of them looked at Bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>"How about this scumbag discusses one thing with you guys and buys the bill here?"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>The three people saw this.
<br><br>At once, they sat down on their asses.
<br><br>Almost a scared blind.
<br><br>It seems that these gentlemen are asking them to pay the bill!
<br><br>This is 90 million immortal stones.
<br><br>Even if they put together all their belongings, they might not have that much.
<br><br>"Aiya, look at your virtue."
<br><br>"Aren't you guys rare for that dog food from your dog master?"
<br><br>"This scum promise you, buy the single, I let the dog master give you ten each."
<br><br>"In addition, this pile of rags you can pick the same to go."
<br><br>Saying that, Bones Ben Wei threw a storage ring on the table.
<br><br>Once the storage ring was opened.
<br><br>It immediately lit up the eyes of the three people.
<br><br>Inside, there were actually top-grade immortal weapons without exception.
<br><br>The three people breathed heavily and just felt like they wanted to smoke.
<br><br>They had never seen so many top grade immortal weapons in their lives.
<br><br>Opportunity.
<br><br>This was a big chance.
<br><br>This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity given to them by Master Bones.
<br><br>In front of the top immortal weapons, a mere 90 million is nothing, even if they sold their family, they still have to get the 90 million.
<br><br>Not to mention, there are ten dog food from the dog grand master.
<br><br>"A few masters continue to wait here, we will go to sell all our family property, and will soon come to pay the bill."
<br><br>The three men knelt on the ground and spoke respectfully.
<br><br>Afterwards, they picked one of the top-tier immortal weapons from them as instructed by Bone Ben Wei and hurriedly ran out.
<br><br>First shift.
