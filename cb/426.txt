 After one billion talisman papers were cast through the void to all parts of the Immortal River Continent, the youth sitting on the bed breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"I, Wu Chang'an, no, I am now Wu Tao."
<br><br>"My Wu Tao's 1.1 billion doppelgangers are cast on this continent, each one has my aura, plus the look and bloodline are exactly the same as mine, just ask who can tell the difference?"
<br><br>"Even if that person's eyes and ears chase me, but can kill me one, but also can kill my 1.1 billion?"
<br><br>"And my real body is hidden in the North Sea in this barren land of the small sect, anonymously as an outer disciple, just ask, who can find me?"
<br><br>"Hahahahaha ......"
<br><br>Thinking of this foolproof layout, for a moment, even a cautious person like Wu Changan could not help but laugh out loud.
<br><br>Just at that moment, there came the shout of Yun Dai from outside.
<br><br>"Senior Brother Wu Tao, a new senior brother has come in to the sect and will be arranged to live with you."
<br><br>"Okay, no problem."
<br><br>Wu Tao responded to a cry and got up to welcome him. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Just walking to the door, he was caught off guard and collided with the two people who came in.
<br><br>Wu Changan looked up.
<br><br>Frozen.
<br><br>The smile on his face, also instantly froze.
<br><br>Yi Feng's devilish face, in his pupils, magnified violently.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>This glance directly made Wu Changan's soul fly apart, and his body couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>This person ......
<br><br>This person ......
<br><br>How did this person find his way here?
<br><br>Fear spread Wu Chang'an heart, a strong sense of crisis is making his body pores expand.
<br><br>However, just as Wu Chang'an was frozen still, Yi Feng came towards him with a smile on his face.
<br><br>He extended his palm.
<br><br>"Brother Wu Tao, hello."
<br><br>This smile made Wu Changan's scalp tingle.
<br><br>This smile.
<br><br>So hideous so hideous.
<br><br>It seemed to be saying to him, "You can't escape from my palm.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>This person was simply too terrifying.
<br><br>He even never would have thought that he spread out eleven billion blindfolds were seen through by this person at a glance, and also spanned millions of miles to precisely find his true body.
<br><br>This kind of terrifying strength is simply beyond Wu Changan's imagination.
<br><br>"What to do, what to do?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an rolled his eyes.
<br><br>It was impossible to break out head-on, it seemed that the only way to leave was through the previously buried transmission array.
<br><br>Thinking of this.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an breathed a sigh of relief.
<br><br>Fortunately, in addition to the 1.1 billion doppelganger's blindfold, he did not have no other layout.
<br><br>Back when he entered the Green Ox Sect, he laid out a teleportation formation in this courtyard, just in case.
<br><br>And now it seems that this teleportation formation is coming in handy.
<br><br>Can't help it.
<br><br>He will intentionally or unintentionally gaze, looked at a small flower pot placed next to the door.
<br><br>Not bad.
<br><br>This small flower pot is the teleportation array he set up.
<br><br>As long as he is close to start, it can instantly transport him away.
<br><br>What's even more incredible is that his teleportation array is disposable and will self-destruct as soon as it has been activated.
<br><br>In this way, after he teleported away, it was impossible for Yi Feng to follow the teleportation formation and come over.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>But at this moment, an abrupt sound came from the side.
<br><br>The sound fell on Wu Changan's ears and was so pleasant to the ears.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Wu Chang'an's body trembled, and a bad premonition appeared in his heart as he fiercely looked over.
<br><br>At once, he found that the flower pot that he had cited as his base card ......
<br><br>fell over.
<br><br>Along with an imperceptible flash of golden light, the teleportation array was activated, merely teleporting away a mosquito that happened to fly by.
<br><br>The next instant, the teleportation array has been extinguished.
<br><br>It was destroyed.
<br><br>"Yikes."
<br><br>"I'm really sorry, I accidentally touched it."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly picked up the flower pot and said with a face full of embarrassment, "Fortunately, fortunately the flower pot didn't break."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Wu Changan was on the verge of tears.
<br><br>The fear all over his body had spread to his brain.
<br><br>For the first time in so many years, he felt that the death crisis reached 100 percent.
<br><br>A demon.
<br><br>This was simply a demon.
<br><br>"Nah, I still have things to do, so I will not go in, are the same disciple brothers, you guys cultivate a good relationship." Cloud dance in a side commanded.
<br><br>"Okay senior sister Yunmai, you go busy, I will cultivate a good relationship with brother Wu Tao." Yi Feng said with a smile.
<br><br>These words fell on Wu Chang'an's ears and made his teeth gnash.
<br><br>Who wants to cultivate a relationship with you!
<br><br>He couldn't help but growl inwardly.
<br><br>Sweat, couldn't help but fall low from his forehead.
<br><br>No.
<br><br>I can't give up.
<br><br>I've been in this world for more than 20 years, another 10,000 years and I'll be invincible, I can't give up like this.
<br><br>Since this person did not kill me first, for whatever reason, it will be my chance.
<br><br>Furthermore.
<br><br>It's not like I don't have a layout elsewhere.
<br><br>As long as I can seize any opportunity, I will be able to escape this place.
<br><br>Thinking like this, Wu Changan calmed down a little.
<br><br>"Aiya, Brother Wu Tao actually knows how to play chess."
<br><br>Just then, Yi Feng noticed that on the stone table next to the doorway, there was a remnant game of chess.
<br><br>On hearing that.
<br><br>Wu Chang'an, who had just calmed down a bit, his eyes snapped.
<br><br>Here.
<br><br>He had found it again?
<br><br>Just when he was praying that Yi Feng didn't see anything fishy at all, Yi Feng moved his palm and moved one of the chess pieces to a different position.
<br><br>"It's not exactly a stalemate, look, it's not a broken game." Yi Feng said with a smiling face.
<br><br>He felt extremely proud of himself for breaking the game instantly.
<br><br>But Wu Changan sat on his butt.
