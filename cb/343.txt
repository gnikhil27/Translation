After getting the conditions for building the clan from the two Lu Qingshan, Yi Feng could only ask Ye Bei to slow down their construction team for a while.
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>Early in the morning.
<br><br>Yi Feng went out.
<br><br>Since Pingjiang City was the territory of the Qingshan Sect, his sect could definitely not continue to be built in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>It was a good thing that Yi Feng had studied the map all night yesterday and had a rough definition of the sect's location.
<br><br>In the place bordering Pingjiang City and the Makufu Mountain Range, there is a huge freshwater lake, which, judging from the map, seems to be the largest freshwater lake in the entire Xianjiang Continent.
<br><br>It's just that not much people usually come here, and it doesn't belong to any power area.
<br><br>On the map, in the middle of this freshwater lake, there is a small island, and Yi Feng wants to establish the sect on this island.
<br><br>Today, he came out for a field trip.
<br><br>Soon after, Yi Feng had arrived at the destination. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Only one glance.
<br><br>Yi Feng fell in love with this place.
<br><br>The surface of the water is sparkling, the lake wind blowing, giving people a feeling of relaxation.
<br><br>And the island is standing on the lake level, surrounded by water on all sides.
<br><br>From a distance, the island is not too big, not too small, there is a large flat terrain in front, and behind the island is a small piece of mountain forest.
<br><br>This mountain forest made Yi Feng greatly excited.
<br><br>Because it was in line with his original intention of getting a small back mountain to fool people.
<br><br>The most important thing was that the sect was extremely secure to be established in such a remote place and did not have to worry about being targeted by other sects.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>He never wanted to build this sect big and strong, but just wanted to complete the task.
<br><br>Yi Feng took out his sickle as well as tools, built a small bamboo raft, and then rowed towards the island.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yi Feng's small bamboo raft just reached the shore, a pale figure, rushed out from the island.
<br><br>He was dressed in rags, apparently suffering from a serious injury, and from the look of fear on his face, it seemed that he was being chased by something.
<br><br>But when he saw Yi Feng, his eyes lit up.
<br><br>Rushing to Yi Feng's boat, he drank towards Yi Feng: "Kid, I order you to hurry up and row the boat."
<br><br>While shouting at Yi Feng, he looked back at the back and muttered, "This guy is afraid of water, he can't leave the island at all, as long as he reaches the waters, he can't hurt me."
<br><br>This person muttering look plus the injured look, let Yi Feng froze.
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask: "What the hell is wrong with you?"
<br><br>"A mere punk, did I tell you to talk, and still don't listen to orders to row?" The youth looked Yi Feng up and down, and seeing that Yi Feng was a mortal, he coldly scolded, "I'll kill you if you don't listen to orders!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's brow furrowed.
<br><br>Immediately, he activated the system detection system.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Detection subject: Li Yang Yuan."
<br><br>"Talent: super trash."
<br><br>The system's voice came, instantly making Yi Feng's heart feel better about this person.
<br><br>Damn, I thought it was how awesome, crazy like this, but it turned out to be another stupid person with super trash talent.
<br><br>"Get the fuck out of here!"
<br><br>Yi Feng black face, a foot will be this Li Yang Yuan kicked off the boat, flopped into the lake.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>"Damn!"
<br><br>"Punk, you punk, how dare you?"
<br><br>Li Yang Yuan fluttered the water, staring at his eyes and emitting an unbelievable voice.
<br><br>This damn mortal, he actually dared to kick him off the boat, where did he get the guts to do that.
<br><br>"Still pushing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the bamboo pole that held up the boat, and knocked on his head with a pole, which immediately knocked his head.
<br><br>"Ah, you, damn damn!"
<br><br>"Damn mortal, how dare you offend me like this, if I wasn't seriously injured and couldn't exert my cultivation, I would have skinned you at this moment."
<br><br>Li Yang Yuan fluttered in the water and sent out a malicious voice towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Just you still cultivate, blow you, hurry up and give me to get out!"
<br><br>Yi Feng lifted the bamboo pole is about to throw over.
<br><br>See the situation, Li Yang Yuan miserable white face on swimming towards the distance, afraid of being Yi Feng pumped him.
<br><br>Because at the moment his state is really too bad, if really by this mortal pumped over in the water drowned, it is too suffocating for him.
<br><br>But while swimming, he also shouted viciously at Yi Feng: "Damn mortal, you wait for me, if you do not die on this island, I will definitely come back to pull you out of your bones."
<br><br>"Wait for you."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his middle finger, his face full of disdain.
<br><br>A super trashy thing with talent, I'm afraid even the few bosses in town can't compare, he is really not put in the eyes.
<br><br>To prevent that guy from stealing the boat, Yi Feng locked up the raft and started to wander around this island.
<br><br>"This island, I really like it too much!"
<br><br>"There are mountains and water, if you want to eat game, next to the Makufu Mountain Range, if you want to eat fishy, you can fish by sitting directly on the ground, and you can go back to Pingjiang City if you want!"
<br><br>"Ahahahaha!"
<br><br>"From now on I declare that this island is mine!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stood at the highest point of the island and announced loudly with his arms open wide.
<br><br>Under the ground.
<br><br>A human figure burrowed out.
<br><br>His face was filled with distress.
<br><br>"Originally, with my current cultivation level, I could have met on the Immortal River Continent forever, safe and sound, because the continent's recognized strongest person would only have a millionth threat to my life."
<br><br>"But damn it, I don't know which foolishness has nothing better to do than to eat, the sky to break, get to the realm must enter the immortal world!"
<br><br>"If I didn't have the foresight to get stuck in the last level without breaking through, then I would have to go to that horrible place in the Immortal Realm!"
<br><br>"Fortunately, I found this island."
<br><br>"This small to bees and mice, large to wild boars and hares, I have fought a good relationship, even the strongest on the island that sealed the guy, the threat to my life is only one billionth, not to mention the existence of it, can drive away some outsiders, this is not just now to drive away a silly."
<br><br>"That is to say, this island is absolutely safe for me."
<br><br>"I can live on this island for 10,000 years, and after 10,000 years, I can break through the last level and become the strongest person when I enter the immortal world!"
<br><br>"So, from now on, this island is my home, Wu Chang'an."
<br><br>Wu Changan rare full of security, emitted a happy voice.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as his voice fell, on the peak of the island, another voice of wild laughter came out.
<br><br>"Ahahahaha!"
<br><br>"From now on I declare that this island is mine ......"
<br><br>As soon as this voice entered Wu Changan's ears, it immediately made him freeze in place.
<br><br>"Nani?"
<br><br>"Hathaway?"
