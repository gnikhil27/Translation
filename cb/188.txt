Shake the sky Que shocked speechless, a time speech in place.
<br><br>A long time can not calm down.
<br><br>"Not right."
<br><br>But in the twinkling of an eye, he suddenly reacted that this was not a dog at all, but a powerful Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf among demonic beasts.
<br><br>Zun level Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf ......
<br><br>This is even in the Sky-devouring Demon Wolf clan, it is also a bearer-like existence, right?
<br><br>And looking at the lasso around his neck, it seems that he is being raised as a dog?
<br><br>What kind of person is so generous?
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Shocked, he inclined his head to look at Wu Yonghong and the others, and asked again, "They are working for that one?"
<br><br>"What do you think?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Although Guan Yunpeng said so, the answer was already obvious, causing a tremor to shake Tian Que's body.
<br><br>Martial Dignity planting land.
<br><br>Martial Dignity carries dung.
<br><br>The Demon Dignitary of the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan was used as a dog!
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>Under the chain of shock, Shaking Heavenly Que felt that his whole head was dumbfounded, and he felt that it became difficult to breathe.
<br><br>Moreover, he also instantly understood the terrible fact that the person who bullied his disciple and the person who gave Guan Yunpeng the chance were the same person.
<br><br>And it was a real high level person!
<br><br>That is to say, his disciple Ye Bei also did not alarming.
<br><br>And in the heat of his mind, he almost took his sword and cut the residence of the high person.
<br><br>The thought of this, his back surged out in a cold sweat, straight feeling weak at the soles of his feet, his heart in no longer want to revenge.
<br><br>Perhaps he shake the sky Que temper is explosive, for their own sword path has been courageous forward.
<br><br>But, also score a point is what time ah.
<br><br>Even for him to take the dung are Martial Dignity, he is a peak of Martial Sect, is not enough to plug the teeth?
<br><br>At the same time, he also finally understood why Guan Yunpeng would block him, and even disregarded the old friendship and fought against him.
<br><br>"Old man Guan, I ......"
<br><br>He turned his embarrassed expression to Guan Yunpeng.
<br><br>"Humph, don't you talk to me." Guan Yunpeng drank with a black face, "It's considered your luck that I showed mercy to you just now and didn't kill you directly."
<br><br>"I ......"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que for a time do not know what to say, also know that they have broken a heavenly disaster, transmitting a weak voice asked: "So now, what to do?"
<br><br>"What to do?"
<br><br>"Humph, we made such a big noise here, you think they don't know?" Guan Yunpeng scolded, "Look at the eyes of those Martial Dignitaries who were planting the land for the gentleman just now, what kind of eyes are they looking at us?"
<br><br>"Lol."
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Shaking Heavenly Que's heart jumped and his face was filled with a deadly pallor.
<br><br>No wonder, just now when Wu Yonghong and the others passed by, they looked at them with such a meaningful look.
<br><br>"Be good here, waiting for the sir to send!" Guan Yunpeng Wu drank with a black face, "Now let's not talk about the chance, just pray that sir won't take our lives!"
<br><br>"Hardly, can't we, can't we run?" Shaking Heavenly Que asked dumbly.
<br><br>"Run?"
<br><br>"Hmph, foolish, if you can run, then you can run all you want!" Rolling Yunpeng scolded.
<br><br>Shaking Tian Que apprehensively planted his head, not daring to say half a word.
<br><br>"Disciple, what's so noisy outside just now?" Yi Feng, who had just woken up, washed his face and asked Zhong Qing, who was wiping the table.
<br><br>"Master, wait a moment, I will go out to see."
<br><br>Saying that, Zhong Qing put down the work in his hand and walked towards the outside.
<br><br>Seeing Zhong Qing, Guan Yunpeng's heart thumped.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>There was no way that Mister didn't know what was happening to them and had sent his senior disciples out.
<br><br>Unable to help himself, he hurriedly bowed his body and became extremely respectful.
<br><br>At the same time, looking at the dull-headed Shaking Heavenly Que, he hurriedly made another wink.
<br><br>However, Shaking Heavenly Que's heart was filled with doubts.
<br><br>A little boy.
<br><br>What is he afraid of?
<br><br>How to look at it, there is no cultivation on it!
<br><br>"Brother Guan, are you too nervous, a little boy and to ......"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que muttered in a small voice, but before he could fully finish his words, he was interrupted by Guan Yunpeng heavily.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>"What do you know, do you know who this person is?"
<br><br>"Who is it?" Shaking Heavenly Que asked.
<br><br>"He is the disciple of a high person, you think he has no cultivation, that's because your realm is too low to see, do you know that it was him who casually cut off the black sword that chased me for ten thousand miles!" Guan Yunpeng said with extra solemnity.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Shaking the sky Que smiled, his heart immediately panicked.
<br><br>The strength of the Black Sword he knew very well, it is half a foot into the existence of the Martial Exalted, than he shake the sky Que can be even more powerful a few points, just by this little boy with a knife to cut?
<br><br>Then cut him, is not the same.
<br><br>In response, Shake Tian Que hurriedly followed Guan Yun Peng and lowered his head, his heart thumping.
<br><br>Zhong Qing frowned and turned his gaze to the two men, his eyes looked up and down.
<br><br>For a moment, the two Guan Yunpeng felt their scalps tingling and their bodies trembling a little.
<br><br>"You guys, fighting?" Zhong Qing looked at the wretched Shaking Heavenly Que, and the unkempt Guan Yunpeng, and sent out his voice.
<br><br>The two men were even more fearful in their hearts and stammered for half a day before they nodded their heads in a stifled manner.
<br><br>"You people, you really can't change your ways!" Zhong Qing frowned and looked at Guan Yunpeng with a hint of anger and said, "You fought here last time, and you actually did it again this time."
<br><br>These words fell on Guan Yunpeng's heart, the heart to cry out, a time want to shake the sky que to dismantle!
<br><br>"Yo, you actually broke two tiles of my martial school?" At this time, Zhong Qing came again with an angry voice.
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng took a look and his heart thudded.
<br><br>Yup.
<br><br>Just now, although he had stopped all of Shaking Heavenly Que's sword, but he could not fully defend against the leaked sword qi.
<br><br>A piece of tile is a small matter.
<br><br>But to offend Mr. is true ah!
<br><br>"Very well, you guys wait here, I'll go ask master what to do!" Zhong Qing glared at them and while walking towards the martial arts school, he yelled at Wu Yonghong and the others, "Old Uncle Wu, a few of you help me watch them, don't let them escape, I'll go and talk to Master."
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Several people smiled, immediately the work in hand to stop, carrying a hoe shovel with a threatening gaze, forced towards the two people.
<br><br>"This ...... this this this ......"
<br><br>At this moment, the two people directly shivered.
<br><br>Three Martial Dignitaries forced to come, this kind of formation, almost scared their guts out.
<br><br>And what scared them even more was that only at this moment did they realize that the hoes and shovels in their hands were not ordinary objects, at the very least, they were sacred items of divine quality.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>Pumping backwards, the two men's paws involuntarily retreated, holy artifacts of holy goods used to plant the land, what the hell is this fucking land outside the sky.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Just between their subconscious backing up, a loud sound came from behind.
<br><br>Scaring the two men with a jolt.
<br><br>Turned around to look, found a pair of buckets of manure stopped behind them, a manure carrying a face full of fierce look at them.
<br><br>Completely blocked their way back.
