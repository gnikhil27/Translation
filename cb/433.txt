"Don't just keep an eye on Night Energy, keep an eye on the back of him."
<br><br>"Look at who's coming out with him."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, it is most important to see who is behind him."
<br><br>The four people passed out excited voices, staring intently at the small door of that small courtyard, not even daring to blink their eyes.
<br><br>At the right moment.
<br><br>Yi Feng went out.
<br><br>Seeing this, the four patriarchs' eyes fiercely stared, focusing their gaze dead on Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>Only, at this moment, Yi Feng went out while bidding farewell to Yunmai's parents, resulting in the four people not seeing Yi Feng's appearance at all, only seeing Yi Feng's back.
<br><br>But even this back shadow was enough for them.
<br><br>"It's him!"
<br><br>The four people almost spoke with one voice. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Yes, yes, that's him, that's the back figure from the First Line Valley."
<br><br>"En, although I didn't see his real appearance in the First Line Valley, but just this back figure I recognize him even if I turn into dust."
<br><br>"It's true that the sky is not to blame, we finally found this one!"
<br><br>"This time, we must see clearly what this master really looks like."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, yes, we must see clearly."
<br><br>The four people held down the excitement in their hearts and waited for Yi Feng to turn around.
<br><br>"Uncle and aunt, goodbye first." Yi Feng cupped his fist and smiled, "Thank you for your hospitality today."
<br><br>Yun father is an honest man, did not say a few words from the beginning to the end, just sent out the door smiling and nodding, not that he does not like Yi Feng and the others, but his personality may belong to the kind of not very good at dealing with.
<br><br>"Good good, come back next time when you are free." Yun mother, on the other hand, said with a smile on her face.
<br><br>"Thanks a lot auntie mother."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled lightly.
<br><br>After saying that, only then slowly turned around and left.
<br><br>And after Yi Feng Yi Feng turned around, the four experts waiting in the dark finally got a clear look at Yi Feng's appearance.
<br><br>"Really is a high person, long really good-looking."
<br><br>Liu Gu glowed in one eye and said to himself.
<br><br>"En, indeed, seeing him looks like a spring breeze, and like a warm sun in this icy breath, straight to make people feel good." Yun Tianlong also could not help but praise similarly.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>This moment for the four people, the heart is excited, face filled with excitement.
<br><br>After all, after inquiring and tracking for so long, finally know what this person looks like.
<br><br>After knowing the appearance, the next thing you can think about is how to rub the opportunity.
<br><br>"Uh,...... everyone have not found, this high person is a little familiar?"
<br><br>Just at this time, Li Canghai coldly popped up a sentence.
<br><br>After saying that, he looked at the three people next to him.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The remaining three people also moved their eyebrows.
<br><br>"When you say so, to does look a bit familiar."
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi said with a thoughtful look.
<br><br>"Yes, I also feel a little familiar."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian rubbed his chin and said.
<br><br>"Very familiar indeed, always feel like I've seen it somewhere."
<br><br>Yun Tianlong likewise echoed and agreed with what they said.
<br><br>But in the end ......
<br><br>Where have I seen it before?
<br><br>The four people spinning memory desperately thinking, but a time but some can not recall ......
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>Suddenly, a side of the sword Hengtian like a dry duck quacked.
<br><br>Palms pointing to the distant Yi Feng, staring dead in the eyes shivering.
<br><br>"I I I ......"
<br><br>
<br><br>Jian Hengtian emitted a stammering voice, and at this moment trembled all over his body.
<br><br>What's more incredible to the three people is that Jian Hengtian actually cried directly, slapping himself one after another.
<br><br>"Where in the world have you seen him?"
<br><br>"Why don't you say it quickly?"
<br><br>"Also, you don't have to look like this, right?"
<br><br>"Yes, what is the reason for slapping yourself?"
<br><br>"At least is the head of a family, can not calm down, we have recently searched for him for so long, even if we have seen once did not recognize, it is also justifiable, right?"
<br><br>Seeing Jian Hengtian's abnormal appearance, the three were busy looking anxiously at Jian Hengtian, vocalizing their inquiries.
<br><br>"Woooooooo, Guan Tong, Guan Tong City ......"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian mouth while whimpering and howling, while crying and saying: "Just in the official pond city we recruit disciples, the central square, we have seen ......"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The three people's expressions suddenly stalled.
<br><br>This message, like an explosive thunder resounded in their minds.
<br><br>A gust of wind crossed.
<br><br>Several people froze like a wooden chicken, even the surrounding air was frozen, filled with an eerie atmosphere.
<br><br>Because a few people instantly recalled, Jian Hengtian said what is going on.
<br><br>This, wasn't this the same mortal who had mixed in to join their four sects that day in the central square of Guan Tang City!
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>So, they had not only seen it.
<br><br>Rather, they had dealt with it deeply!
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>"Slap!"
<br><br>Almost at the same time, the other three slapped themselves in the face at the same time.
<br><br>It was so, loud and pleasant to the ears ......
<br><br>Hate ah.
<br><br>The eyes were red with hatred.
<br><br>Not only Jian Hengtian choked, the other three also choked likewise.
<br><br>It turned out that the high person had prepared their chance early on, even to join their clan, yet they were blind, treating the high person as a mortal and pushed out the door.
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>"Snap!"
<br><br>Several people, in their anger, waved several more heavy slaps on their own faces.
