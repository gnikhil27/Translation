"Ancestor, the big event is not good."
<br><br>Green Mountain Sect, Lu Qingshan is in seclusion, Zhu Yun hurriedly came and said, "Jiang Yu's tomb has changed, according to our people who rushed over to report, 90% of the people died!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Could it be that Mr. Prophecy has worked?"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's eyes widened, and while muttering, he then rushed directly towards Jiang Yu's tomb.
<br><br>When he arrived at Jiang Yu's tomb, he immediately drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>In front of his eyes, he could only describe it as miserable.
<br><br>Previously rumored that the vast number of experts all gone, only three or two of the experts lying on the ground, or lost arms and legs, or full of black face, or lost cultivation, some are only a breath left ......
<br><br>And they were able to escape, also because they had reached the door before the change happened.
<br><br>And those who went deep inside, none of them were seen coming out.
<br><br>"This, what in the end happened?" First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Lu Qingshan stared at the eyes murmuring, to know the people who are qualified to come here, the lowest minimum are Martial King experts ah, which Martial Emperor Martial Sect is no longer a few.
<br><br>Surprisingly, there are only a few people left?
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>At that moment again, several figures rushed out from the Heavenly Gate, precisely the people from the three great sects.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>But just as they were about to rush out, a black phantom came after them, accompanied by a thick black gas, opening its pouring mouth to bite out.
<br><br>"Miss be careful."
<br><br>Lin Bo looked at the rearmost Yun Xian Que, his face suddenly changed, the martial strength surged out, a palm slapped over.
<br><br>However, in the face of this palm the black phantom was not afraid at all, but instead turned its mouth to bite down towards his palm.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Lin Bo emitted a harsh cry, his body was directly torn off most of the side.
<br><br>"Lin Bo."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's eyes burst into tears, and it took all his body cultivation to pull to tear Lin Bo back with difficulty.
<br><br>After landing, the three major forces were all pale, gasping for air, full of fear.
<br><br>Looking at this scene, Lu Qingshan was even more shocked.
<br><br>Lin Bo was just torn off half of the body not to mention the fifth formation chest was hit with a hole, the long sword empty also missing a leg.
<br><br>You know these three, but all are martial arts experts ah!
<br><br>And Yun Xian Que a few people, although a little better, but also all seriously injured.
<br><br>Obviously, they were able to survive thanks to the protection of those few Martial Exalts.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>After taking a deep breath, uncontrollably, Lu Qingshan's back was filled with cold sweat, full of fear.
<br><br>"Sir's prophecy is really accurate."
<br><br>"Fortunately, fortunately I asked sir before, if not, I would have to fall in it!"
<br><br>"Sir, worthy of being a sir!"
<br><br>Saying that, he hurried to help Lin Bo heal his injuries, after all, his Qingshan Sect and Feng Yun Valley relationship is still okay, this kind of thing happened, and always can not stand by and watch.
<br><br>After a long time, Lin Bo's injuries were only slightly stabilized.
<br><br>Seeing this, Lu Qingshan sighed and said: "You say this is why you guys are suffering, if you had listened to me earlier, not to play this mess will not do?"
<br><br>At that, the two looked up.
<br><br>"So you, knew there was danger inside?" Yun Xian Que asked, quite questioning.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan nodded awkwardly and said, "Yes, I did know there was danger, that's why I didn't want to get involved, but it's not like I didn't warn you guys about this!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que smacked his lips.
<br><br>Dumbfounded.
<br><br>Actually, he couldn't say half a word.
<br><br>Because at that time, Lu Qingshan did solemnly remind them, but at that time, she was so preoccupied with the treasure that she simply scoffed at Lu Qingshan's words and felt ridiculous.
<br><br>Looking back now ......
<br><br>The ridiculous is not Lu Qingshan, but they.
<br><br>Because at that time, if they had listened to Lu Qingshan's words, perhaps they would not have suffered such heavy losses.
<br><br>Especially Lin Bo.
<br><br>Now, although his life was saved, he was also considered a large part of the waste.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Why are you still talking about this."
<br><br>Lin Bo shook his head with a difficult face, although he said so, his face was also full of remorse.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que looked gloomy, but suddenly remembering something, she lifted her head and asked suspiciously, "But how did you know there was danger inside?"
<br><br>"It was a senior master who told me!" Speaking of this, a look of reverence flashed in Lu Qingshan's eyes.
<br><br>"Who is it?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que fiercely tensed up and said.
<br><br>"I can't tell you."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan smiled apologetically and turned to leave, obviously not wanting to say much about it.
<br><br>Looking at Lu Qingshan's back as he left, Yun Xianque asked, "Do you believe it?"
<br><br>"Eight or nine!"
<br><br>Lin Bo shrunk his pupils, then said.
<br><br>"Then, who exactly is it?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was filled with doubts, but Lu Qingshan had already left.
<br><br>After the crowd adjusted their breath, looking at the movement still coming from inside that stone door, none of them dared to fight anymore and left.
<br><br>The news of this place also spread out thoroughly, and more cultivators flocked towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The three major sects were no exception.
<br><br>Wind and Cloud Valley.
<br><br>"Elder Fang, Elder Yun, you two quickly rush to Pingjiang City, those three supreme treasures, we in Feng Yun Valley must take them!" A man sent out his voice to the two old men behind him.
<br><br>Deep inside the Heavenly Sword Sect.
<br><br>Two sword light swept out, two aura of thick figures stepping on the sword away.
<br><br>Blowing Snow Mountain Villa.
<br><br>"The organ has gone, the rest is a man-made struggle, that holy treasures, we blow snow mountain villa must take." A white-haired old man, leisurely voice transmission.
<br><br>For a time, the wind rose in Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Because all people knew it by heart.
<br><br>Despite having suffered a big change, when the organs inside the tomb were automatically exhausted and the Yin Qi on the three Saint Treasures dissipated, it would be effortless to take those treasures again.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Before the mechanism disappears, no one dares to move, and is not afraid that the treasures are taken.
<br><br>After all, with an organ of that strength, it is simply impossible for anyone to have the ability to take it away.
<br><br>"Dog thing, dog thing!"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng tied the skeleton to the acacia tree with a rope and lashed it with one whip after another.
<br><br>"Let you damn white whoring, I let you damn wave, also go to your skeleton Ben Wei, today I smoked you to death."
<br><br>Yi Feng while screaming and cursing, while venting his anger.
<br><br>Until will draw themselves out of a cold sweat, Yi Feng is considered to stop.
<br><br>"Qing, Qing, come on."
<br><br>After seeing Yi Feng leave, a light voice came from the skeleton.
<br><br>"What's wrong brother?"
<br><br>The dog wagged his tail and asked busily.
<br><br>"Quick, untie the brother, I'll take you to get money." The skeleton said urgently: "In the end, it's all about money, if we have money, how can we still be beaten?"
<br><br>"Where to get money, brother?" The dog asked in a whisper.
<br><br>"Don't worry, I have my own place!"
<br><br>The skeleton said lightly.
<br><br>"Okay, but there is danger brother cover me ha!" Said, Ao Qing help skeleton untie.
<br><br>After untying, the skeleton took the dog and instantly disappeared.
<br><br>A few moments later, it had arrived outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>"Look, there are a lot of gold coins in here."
<br><br>The skeleton said, and then took the lead towards the stone door and walked in.
<br><br>"Brother, it looks very dangerous inside eh?" Ao Qing hurriedly followed, looking at the phantoms that swept by inside from time to time, shivered and asked warily.
<br><br>"It's not a big deal, you'll be fine if you go with me!"
<br><br>The skeleton casually pinched off a black phantom in the form of a greedy wolf and led Ao Qing towards the inside.
