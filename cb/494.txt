"I'm asking who sent it?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao asked, plumbing the depths.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"It seems to be a gift from a female friend who also seems to be a cultivator."
<br><br>Yi Feng racked his brain and then came out unsure, because the umbrella seemed to be from Bai Piao Piao, but then it didn't seem to be.
<br><br>"Female friend?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao's heart was sour.
<br><br>This abominable guy seems to be quite good with women?
<br><br>Otherwise, a valuable sacred treasure umbrella would be gifted to you a mortal little guy?
<br><br>And looking at Yun Yaoyao's questioning look, Yi Feng couldn't help but smile and ask: "What, do you also think this umbrella is good, it's pretty?"
<br><br>"Good-looking my ass, I want you to throw it away right now." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Yun Yoyao's face is full of anger, a look to storm away, can't wait to grab Yi Feng and beat him up.
<br><br>"Why?"
<br><br>"Lost what I use for fishing, sun into a douche?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned and asked.
<br><br>"Umbrella, I can send you another one, but you must lose this one."
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao sent out a voice that could not be refused, and then the storage ring moved and took out a big red umbrella.
<br><br>If there were other people here, they would have recognized that this red umbrella was not half as bad as the big black umbrella before, and it was even to the level of a pseudo-immortal product.
<br><br>"Red?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was full of black, but looking at Yun Yoyo's look of not giving up until he was willing, Yi Feng reluctantly accepted it.
<br><br>The red one is red.
<br><br>Anyway, it's just a fish, whatever the fuck it is.
<br><br>But women are really fucking troublesome.
<br><br>Also thieves inexplicable.
<br><br>See Yi Feng compromise, Yun Yoyao only to reveal the color of victory, a small waist, smoothly pick up the hands of a small bite of cucumber.
<br><br>Cucumbers are sweet and tasty.
<br><br>The taste is indeed very good.
<br><br>"Aiya, you see you just bite so little, reserved what ah, and not have not seen you eat beef jerky look." Seeing this, Yi Feng on the side couldn't help but spit out.
<br><br>Yun Yiyao directly exploded.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, do you believe I kicked you into the lake?"
<br><br>"I'm wrong I'm wrong."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly smiled and begged for forgiveness, and began to say in a serious manner, "No more fooling around, no more fooling around, that said stay with me for a few more days, I'll take you around and see the customs and traditions of my Pingjiang City."
<br><br>But once said, full of anger Yun Yoyo but the eyes dimmed down.
<br><br>"I'm afraid, I'll have to leave later."
<br><br>She said in a low voice.
<br><br>During this period of time, too many things had happened.
<br><br>She knew a lot of secret secrets of the Immortal River Continent and also found out that she was a Reincarnator.
<br><br>If it was before.
<br><br>She would not hesitate to agree to Yi Feng and take a look at the so-called customs of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>But now.
<br><br>It was already out of my hands.
<br><br>"What's wrong with you?"
<br><br>Noticing Yun Yoyo's change in mood, Yi Feng asked softly.
<br><br>"No, nothing."
<br><br>She said with desire to speak.
<br><br>After all, such a thing was a level that today's Martial Emperors could not even touch, so what use would it be to talk to Yi Feng?
<br><br>It would only needlessly increase Yi Feng's worries.
<br><br>"This time, I'm here to give you money, this is five million gold coins, that's all I have there."
<br><br>She took out a storage ring and handed it to Yi Feng.
<br><br>The ring opened and it was filled with gold coins.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's eyes, he took it with both hands and held it beautifully in his arms.
<br><br>"In addition, I brought you a pill, after taking this pill, it should be able to allow you to break through from the Mortal realm, directly to the Martial Spirit realm." Yun Yaoyao said.
<br><br>After saying that, Yun Yoyo took out a jade box and handed it to Yi Feng.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"You brought me an elixir and still managed to break through to Martial Spirit?"
<br><br>"You are really a good friend of mine!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was overjoyed.
<br><br>Lovingly, he took the jade box, his heart filled with excitement.
<br><br>Martial Spirit ah.
<br><br>This was a legendary Martial Spirit!
<br><br>When he had glimpsed the Martial Spirit in Nansha, the majestic appearance was still fresh in his mind.
<br><br>And now.
<br><br>He will also become such a terrifying expert!
<br><br>On the side, Yun Yoyao looked at Yi Feng's joyful appearance, her heart could not say what she felt.
<br><br>After today, the two of them are afraid that there is no chance to see each other again.
<br><br>That's why she spent a great deal of money to get a pill to promote from mortal to martial spirit without side effects.
<br><br>After all, in the future of the great turmoil, the chances of a martial spirit coming down are always higher than that of a mortal, right?
<br><br>But she wanted to say something for a long time, but finally did not say the fact that this was the last time they would meet.
<br><br>She felt nothing necessary.
<br><br>And do not want to add unnecessary worries to Yi Feng.
<br><br>As long as he is happy, it is good to be able to survive in the future.
<br><br>Furthermore.
<br><br>People also, there is always sadness and happiness.
<br><br>Take a step back, both are also just a friend ah ......
<br><br>"So what should I do now?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked impatiently, "Eat now or when to eat."
<br><br>"Eat it now!"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo said softly: "Although this pill has no side effects, but the energy within it is huge, you may not be able to withstand it, I am here to be able to protect you, and by the way, I can give you the ability to deal with some unexpected situations."
<br><br>"Good, thanks a lot."
<br><br>Yi Feng followed Yun Yaoyao's instructions and sat down, the crystal clear pill was already in his hand ready.
<br><br>"Let me remind you again, this elixir has a huge energy, your body will suffer a certain amount of pain after you swallow it, so you have to make sure you are ready?" Yun Yeyao reminded solemnly once again.
<br><br>"En, I'm ready."
<br><br>Yi Feng gritted his teeth and solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>In order to be able to become as terrifying as a Martial Spirit expert, one had to endure the pain.
<br><br>"Take it!"
<br><br>Yun Yoyo said.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Yi Feng gritted his teeth, put the pill into his mouth carefully and swallowed it.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Yi Feng clenched his teeth and waited for the impact and baptism of energy.
<br><br>And Yun Yaoyao also became solemn, thick cultivation emanated in his body, while vigilant around to prevent someone from disturbing Yi Feng outside, his gaze also paid attention to Yi Feng's situation every moment.
<br><br>Three quarters of an hour later.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's expressionless face, never appear half can not bear the appearance, Yun Yoyao nodded with satisfaction.
<br><br>This guy.
<br><br>Perseverance is still full of toughness.
<br><br>Such a powerful pain, actually able to carry down without saying a word.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng suddenly raised his head and asked coldly: "Do you take so long for this elixir to play, my legs are sore, how come there is no half reaction?"
