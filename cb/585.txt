This guy a mouthful of waste, Yi Feng heard the fire.
<br><br>If not for his own subordinates have not yet brought over, he will certainly rush to this Guo Shijie a nimble finger hit out.
<br><br>Kill you, damn it!
<br><br>"Really sure, right?" Liu Yan's questioning voice came from behind him.
<br><br>Even though she had heard the report from her subordinates, she still wanted to hear Yi Feng answer with certainty at this moment.
<br><br>After all, such a thing as practicing the One Numinous Finger in one ye is too incredible.
<br><br>"Don't worry. It's just a One Thought Finger." Yi Feng said in a light-hearted manner.
<br><br>Liu Yan looked at his calm appearance, but did not panic at all.
<br><br>But she was still a bit unsure in her heart.
<br><br>So he promised, "If you can really make it, I promise you a condition. As a reward."
<br><br>"What condition?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>As soon as Yi Feng heard the condition, he asked.
<br><br>"Any condition within my power. As long as you mention it." Liu Yan said.
<br><br>"Good." Yi Feng nodded happily, "Peak Master and watch out."
<br><br>Yi Feng said and confidently headed towards the martial practice field.
<br><br>On the Sun Moon Sect's large martial arts practice field.
<br><br>A white-clothed man stood with his hands on the central martial arts training platform.
<br><br>He was floating like an immortal, independent of the tsetse.
<br><br>And around the martial arts training ground has long been standing Wu Wu Yang Yang group of people.
<br><br>Now not only the people of the Star Peak, even its Sun and Moon Peak people have also arrived. Even the other peaks and outer disciples heard that there is a disciple who has practiced the perfection of the One Thought Finger in one night, and also with the Sun Moon peak master.
<br><br>They also came to see the fun.
<br><br>A time outside the martial arts training ground swept over, black pressed a full of people.
<br><br>Yi Feng stood on the platform in the center of the martial arts training ground with his hands, straightened his back, slightly raised his chin, and considered himself to be full of temperament.
<br><br>Unfortunately, in this position, you can't see the sun and moon peak.
<br><br>His afterglow glanced around the martial arts training ground.
<br><br>There were quite a lot of people.
<br><br>Very good.
<br><br>The next moment, Yi Feng raised his hand.
<br><br>The only index finger stretched out and pointed a bit into the distance.
<br><br>Left a little right a little, up a little down a little, neck twist and a little ......
<br><br>"Shoo shoo shoo ......"
<br><br>With a stream of air scattered from Yi Feng's fingertips, the group of people below exploded.
<br><br>"This this ...... is really the airflow that can only come from the perfection of the One Thought finger!" The Star Peak elders below said in shock.
<br><br>"I didn't expect it, ah, I have such a miracle talent in Star Peak!" They stroked their white beards and laughed uproariously, raising their eyebrows.
<br><br>"Yes, practicing the One Thought Finger in just one night is simply a heavenly talent, hahaha!"
<br><br>Liu Yan in the crowd breathed a sigh of relief on his face. At the same time, her gaze was very complicated as she looked towards Yi Feng in the center.
<br><br>When her subordinate had just told her, she was also shocked. Now that she saw with her own eyes that Yi Feng had made the Perfection One Thought Finger, she still couldn't help but be shocked.
<br><br>After being shocked, her face was full of joy as she looked towards Guo Shijie who was standing at the front of the crowd.
<br><br>At the same time, Guo Shijie, who was standing in front of the crowd, was full of incredulity.
<br><br>He looked at Yi Feng and backed up one after another.
<br><br>"How is it possible!"
<br><br>"How is it impossible?" Yi Feng blew into his index finger and glanced at Guo Shijie, "Does Peak Master Guo still want to see it?"
<br><br>After saying that, he pointed at the sky again.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie froze for a while, before he slowed down.
<br><br>His face was sullen.
<br><br>"Peak Master Guo, you also saw it with your own eyes. Isn't it time to fulfill your bet?" Yi Feng walked down from the stage of the martial arts training ground.
<br><br>He walked straight towards Guo Shijie.
<br><br>Guo Shijie's gaze was cloudy and his face was so gloomy that water dripped out.
<br><br>Yi Feng didn't care, the angrier Guo Shijie was, the happier he was.
<br><br>"Hurry up, say you Sun Moon Peak is garbage!" He shouted.
<br><br>"You are unbridled!" Guo Shijie was furious and was about to strike.
<br><br>Before his hand could swing towards Yi Feng, he was stopped by Liu Yan who was next to him with a palm strike.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng's eyebrows went up and pushed Liu Yan, who was in front of him and had not yet had time to speak, away.
<br><br>"What are you doing what are you doing??"
<br><br>"Want to hit the old man can not?"
<br><br>"Come, come, come, hit here!" Yi Feng towards Guo Shijie lowered his head, pointing to his own head, "have the ability to hit here, can not kill me you are a waste!"
<br><br>While saying that, Yi Feng will call out his system and jump to the page of the accompanying teleportation return.
<br><br>If Guo Shijie really dared to strike at him, he would instantly teleport back to Dark Shadow Island.
<br><br>Then bring his big brother men to kill over!
<br><br>The actual reincarnation realm is not it? He has a lot of people there!
<br><br>Guo Shijie was extremely angry, so angry that his breath was not even smooth, saved up his anger, and was about to strike over at Yi Feng!
<br><br>With killing intent.
<br><br>Once again, he was stopped by Liu Yan.
<br><br>This time, even Liu Yan used all his strength to stop Guo Shijie, who was in a rage to kill.
<br><br>"Guo Shijie! You have made a vow to the Gods and Heavenly Dao, if you do not comply, the Heavenly Dao will not allow you!" While defending Guo Shijie, Liu Yan said, "Then not only you will be ruined, but also your Sun Moon Peak will be ruined!"
<br><br>Only after hearing this did Guo Shijie stop his hand.
<br><br>He held his face full of red.
<br><br>"Even if I lose to answer the contract, it doesn't prevent me from being able to kill him!" Guo Shijie said, "I didn't say in the bet just now that you won't kill him if you win!"
<br><br>"What, can't afford to lose." Yi Feng was at the back, with both hands, "You have to kill me if you lose. Jealous of my extraordinary talent?"
<br><br>"A trash reincarnation realm, what's the arrogance." He said, cutting a sound.
<br><br>Reincarnation realm, he had a ton of them.
<br><br>There was no fear of not being able to beat Guo Shijie this than.
<br><br>"Shen Yan!" At this time, Liu Yan also could not help but turn around and reminded.
<br><br>Guo Shijie even though obnoxious, but the reincarnation realm, there are several in the Sun Moon Sect. This not only scolded all, but also scolded those who did not reach the Reincarnation Realm.
<br><br>Not even worse than trash.
<br><br>Basically, the entire Sun Moon Sect was offended.
<br><br>Yi Feng also reacted and pointed to Guo Shijie and hurriedly added, "Of course, I'm only talking about him trash. Not everyone here."
<br><br>Hurting the innocent, that was not necessary.
<br><br>"Look, look, I've never! Never seen!!! Such an arrogant person who speaks so loudly and arrogantly to this extent!!!" Guo Shijie was so angry that even his words were tinged with rage.
<br><br>"You've never seen someone with my kind of talent either." Yi Feng stretched out his own index finger, his eyes glanced at Guo Shijie, blew daintily at his index finger, and pointed at the sky.
<br><br>This exasperated Guo Shijie straight shiver.
<br><br>"Okay."
<br><br>Liu Yan made a sound to stop rounding off, but also covered his red lips giggling.
<br><br>It is rare to see Guo Shijie so defeated, it is really inexplicably cool ah.
<br><br>Can't help but to look at Guo Shijie, leisurely laughing, "But then again, since he lost, Guo peak master should also fulfill the gambling agreement."
