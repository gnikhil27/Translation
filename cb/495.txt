Yun Yaoyao froze.
<br><br>"You, you haven't reacted until now after taking the elixir?" She asked with wide eyes.
<br><br>"Uh ...... does urinary urgency count?"
<br><br>Yi Feng seriously looked at Yun Yoyao and asked.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao's forehead was full of black lines.
<br><br>But she was puzzled, this pill Yi Feng swallowed how will not have a half reaction?
<br><br>To know, she this pill is from the hand of immortals, no matter how should not appear problems ah.
<br><br>"You close your eyes again, feel again whether there is any feeling, whether there is any change in the body?" Yun Yaoyao said.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Yi Feng closed his eyes.
<br><br>A few moments later, reopened. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Looking at Yun Yoyao's expectant gaze, he awkwardly asked, "Like the kind of stomach ache from bad food, does it count?"
<br><br>The corner of Yun Yaoyao's mouth twitched.
<br><br>Then raised her jade palm and gently landed on Yi Feng's shoulder, probing Yi Feng's body.
<br><br>After some probing, her face turned ugly.
<br><br>Yi Feng was not lying.
<br><br>That pill actually really didn't give Yi Feng half a bit of power, Yi Feng was still a mortal.
<br><br>"This elixir is indeed of little use to you, all the medicinal power has been lost." Yun Yiyao said with a grimace.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was full of disillusionment.
<br><br>Planted his head.
<br><br>He didn't expect that he was actually wasted to this extent, even such a powerful pill didn't have a half effect on him.
<br><br>He had thought that he could stop relying on that broken system.
<br><br>Now it seems that he still has to be a good disciple!
<br><br>"I'm sorry to have dashed your hopes." Yun Yeyao said in shame.
<br><br>"It's okay, how can I blame you."
<br><br>Yi Feng comforted unconcerned: "And cultivation thing, right, how to say ......"
<br><br>"En?"
<br><br>Yun Yaoyao looked at him suspiciously.
<br><br>"Although I am a mortal, you also think I am a mortal, but I am not a mortal kind of mortal." Yi Feng smiled mysteriously, "Anyway, when you meet me in the future, you will see a different me, and you will definitely be amazed."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made Yun Yoyo laugh and cry.
<br><br>Make her amazed?
<br><br>Although the mouth did not say, but this guy into what kind of waste two people know very well.
<br><br>But this makes Yun Yaoyao quite touched.
<br><br>This guy really let people love and hate ah.
<br><br>Obviously it should be himself to comfort him, but did not expect Yi Feng but comforted himself.
<br><br>"Good, I look forward to the next time we meet, you amaze me."
<br><br>Yun Yeyao said without moving a muscle.
<br><br>She didn't expect to be surprised, she only hoped that Yi Feng could live well in the future.
<br><br>Yun Yoyao left.
<br><br>Said to go, actually stood in the clouds and so on until the evening darkness, Yi Feng collected pole home, she really left.
<br><br>After leaving, Yun Yoyao swept towards a place of nothingness.
<br><br>Then tore the space and walked into a chaos.
<br><br>This chaos, another world.
<br><br>Overhead, countless dense runes, drifting past. Runes, interspersed with wind, fire, lightning and other natural forces.
<br><br>Around the chaos, the east is the spring flowers, the south is the summer heat, the west is the autumn high, the north is snow-capped.
<br><br>And at this moment in the chaos, there are already a number of people gathered, hundreds of them.
<br><br>They are either tall, or immortal, or glowing.
<br><br>There are swordsmen.
<br><br>There were sword warriors.
<br><br>There were formation masters, and there were also alchemy experts ......
<br><br>Just then, the chaos was directly in front.
<br><br>A large monument stone was erected, except that at this time, the monument stone was covered with chaos, blocking any peek.
<br><br>Subsequently, a voice like a flood bell came from above the chaos.
<br><br>"Immortal River Chaos Tablet, will be opened in a year, enlightenment has achieved, when there is a chance to seal the gods into the list!"
<br><br>"After the set to seal the gods into the list, when breaking the immortal river era extinction calamity, can protect the immortal river permanent worry-free!"
<br><br>"All of you who have achieved enlightenment, can enter the immortal pillar first!"
<br><br>With the sound of the voice fell.
<br><br>Below the stone monument, a dazzling pillar of light rises.
<br><br>And there are differences in the pillars of light.
<br><br>The closest to the monument were eighteen red pillars of light.
<br><br>After the red light pillar, there are thirty-six orange light pillars.
<br><br>After the orange pillars, there are seventy-two blue pillars of light.
<br><br>Following that, there were 108 green light pillars.
<br><br>The crowd saw this.
<br><br>Their hearts and minds trembled.
<br><br>They, with great righteousness in their hearts!
<br><br>This is the descendants of the Immortal River, and gathered together.
<br><br>There are also selfishness.
<br><br>Who does not want to have more strength in the future, immortality?
<br><br>So the first time, everyone on the scene will look at the eighteen red pillars of light.
<br><br>Because everyone knows by heart, these eighteen red immortal pillars are closest to the stone monument, enlightenment is relatively easier.
<br><br>"Take your seats!"
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, everyone rushed towards the red immortal pillars.
<br><br>But when the dust had settled on everyone, there were only a few people in the red immortal pillars, and the same was true for the orange and blue light pillars.
<br><br>Most of the people just settled in the green light pillar.
<br><br>It is not that the people do not want to enter the red immortal pillar.
<br><br>It's just that the dao is only a matter of fate in the underworld, when you can only be seated there, you will only be there.
<br><br>"Lord Destruction, all the experts have been seated this time."
<br><br>A silver masked man in the invisible chaos, kneeling on the ground, emitting a respectful voice.
<br><br>"Well, well."
<br><br>Within the chaos, an excited voice came out from the Extermination.
<br><br>"I have planned this matter for countless epochs, and also waited for countless epochs, and also after countless epochs of accumulation, finally in this epoch, I have gathered two hundred and thirty-four people of the Heavenly Family."
<br><br>"These people, there are reincarnators, there are Heavenly Daoists, there are geniuses and experts accumulated over countless epochs, and in a year's time, they will help me achieve the position of Immortal River Heavenly Dao."
<br><br>"Congratulations, my lord."
<br><br>The silver masked man, full of joy, congratulated.
<br><br>"I can't wait to meet, these people of my heavenly family yet."
<br><br>His intention transformed into a void phantom body and walked into the Chaos Hall.
<br><br>With a proud gaze, he swept towards the two hundred and thirty-four immortal pillars below the field.
<br><br>But this glance.
<br><br>Directly dumbfounded!
<br><br>Two hundred and thirty-four immortal pillars, most of them were actually empty, not even half of them.
<br><br>What the hell?
<br><br>Where is everyone?
<br><br>Where did they go?
<br><br>The Void Illusionary Body of the World of Extinction was almost directly angry and his soul flew away.
<br><br>Countless eras down, he had long been planning, the two hundred and thirty-four people in the cycle of karma, for whatever reason, will be gathered here at this moment.
<br><br>But half of them didn't come together, what the hell is it?
<br><br>What the hell is going on?
<br><br>The most annoying thing is that the eighteen red pillars of light, at the moment only six or seven people are actually sitting.
<br><br>This is his most important pawn, there are more than ten in the end where to die.
<br><br>The world almost directly vomit blood.
