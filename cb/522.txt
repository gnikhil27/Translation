She hurriedly stepped off the carriage.
<br><br>Leading the subordinates towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Walking beautiful scenery Yi Feng also perceived, eyes slightly brightened.
<br><br>Quite beautiful a sister ah!
<br><br>"Little woman Yuan Jing, meet senior."
<br><br>The woman bent down her pretty figure and greeted Yi Feng with respectful demeanor.
<br><br>Cultivator?
<br><br>Looking at the pendant sword in Yuan Jing's hand, Yi Feng couldn't help but murmur.
<br><br>"System detection."
<br><br>Yi Feng initiated the command.
<br><br>Soon, a feedback from the system came. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Detection subject: Yuan Jing."
<br><br>"Talent: super trash."
<br><br>Hearing that, Yi Feng frowned slightly.
<br><br>Thought it was a cultivator, but actually a mortal, really wasted such a good-looking girl, I'm afraid that the sword is also brought to defend themselves.
<br><br>But Yi Feng did not look down on people, after all, they are not much worse than the ball, is a waste.
<br><br>"En, seniors?"
<br><br>Seeing that Yi Feng did not respond, Yuan Jing called out softly again.
<br><br>"Oh, girl think I look like this, like seniors?"
<br><br>Yi Feng also slowed down, moved his thumb, and flicked his finger at his still dripping pants, and couldn't help but laugh.
<br><br>Yuan Jing covered her mouth with a smile.
<br><br>Only a fool would treat Yi Feng as an ordinary person because of his appearance, she had seen that scene clearly just now.
<br><br>As for Yi Feng, in her opinion, I am afraid that this senior in front of her is just more grounded.
<br><br>"Seniors do not need to be modest, just now seniors killed the five fish, in this river inside the evil, no one at all to subdue them, but easily by seniors to solve, so powerful strength, the little woman called you a senior, it is appropriate." Yuan Jing said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng dawned on him at the same time, but also quite a bit embarrassed.
<br><br>Thought why this girl called him seniors, it turned out to be because of these five dead fish.
<br><br>"Girl you're too polite, just a few ugly fish, at best, just a little bigger, why so?" Yi Feng could not help but say.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Yuan Jing's pretty face couldn't help but twitch.
<br><br>A master is a master!
<br><br>The five Black Witch Desolate Fish that people were scared of, in this person's mouth was actually just a bit bigger.
<br><br>Listen to it.
<br><br>Are these words from a human being?
<br><br>"These five fish are easy for seniors to exterminate, but for us it is a disaster of extinction ......" said Yuan Jing with emotion.
<br><br>This is true.
<br><br>Who asked you to be super trash.
<br><br>Yi Feng thought so.
<br><br>Of course he did not say it out loud.
<br><br>So since this sister insisted on calling him senior, she could only let her do so.
<br><br>After a simple exchange of pleasantries, Yi Feng brought his circus troupe and joined Yuan Jing's
<br><br>Caravan.
<br><br>Slowly heading towards Yuan family.
<br><br>And the caravan with Yi Feng such an expert, is also a great relaxation, more than a number of people to greet with Yi Feng to offer attentiveness.
<br><br>This had to make Yi Feng lament that this place that he had never been to was just like his Pingjiang City, full of friendship and love.
<br><br>"By the way senior, how did you come to this place?"
<br><br>On the way, Yuan Jing asked softly.
<br><br>"It's funny to say that we were chased here by a dozen tigers." Yi Feng laughed rather helplessly.
<br><br>Yuan Jing's pearl-like beautiful eyes couldn't help but stare.
<br><br>"A dozen, tigers?"
<br><br>"Yes, it's the tigers, so big and big." Yi Feng gestured his palm and described.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng's serious description, Yuan Jing covered her mouth and laughed.
<br><br>The gaze towards Yi Feng was quite meaningful.
<br><br>It was also unexpected that this senior was not only super strong, but even the person was also this humorous and so easy-going.
<br><br>"By the way, I wonder how many people are beside senior?" Yuan Jing looked at the black robe and others outside the carriage and asked softly, "Are they also as strong as senior?"
<br><br>"Powerful?"
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"You don't care about them, a few mongrel trash!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said indifferently.
<br><br>Yuan Jing nodded.
<br><br>Observed the black robe a few more glances, the heart was clear.
<br><br>The black robe can not see any strength, the dog also looks like a guard dog, the centipede also looks ordinary, the only look a little strength of the big dog bear, the surface is also a harmless look.
<br><br>I'm afraid that these few really do not have much strength.
<br><br>Then again, like Yi Feng such experts, to see one, it is already a great luck, and how can encounter a group, really think it is a cabbage.
<br><br>"By the way senior, can you reveal your true strength?"
<br><br>Yuan Jing beauty eyes moved, carefully asked.
<br><br>"I ah?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said, "Actually, I'm really not as powerful as you think, just a mortal who has practiced martial arts for a few years, and the dream is that one day I can become a terrifying as a martial spirit expert."
<br><br>"Pfft!"
<br><br>Yuan Jing covered her red lips and couldn't help but laugh, her pretty charm curled up like a flower branch, looking great.
<br><br>But it made Yi Feng full of confusion.
<br><br>"What are you laughing at?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked with a black face.
<br><br>"No, no ......"
<br><br>Yuan Jing hurriedly explained.
<br><br>But in her heart, she understood that it should be that this senior did not quite want to tell her her true strength.
<br><br>But this way of his response had to be praised, refuting her answer and not being embarrassed at the same time.
<br><br>It has to be said.
<br><br>It was hard not to let people feel good about this kind of person.
<br><br>The Yuan Family was situated in the middle of Yuan City, which was under the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>After the escort mission was completed, Yuan Jing settled Yi Feng and the others inside a rather luxurious mansion.
<br><br>The reason why he agreed to Yuan Jing's request to stay here was because Yi Feng wanted to save money.
<br><br>After all, who wouldn't want to have a place to eat and live for free, right?
<br><br>It just so happened that this Yuancheng was quite large, so it was always possible to find a disciple with ordinary qualifications.
