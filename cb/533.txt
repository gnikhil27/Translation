"Sir, big brother, please still pick!" Wu Tian waved his hand and said.
<br><br>Yi Feng, however, frowned slightly.
<br><br>This little guy.
<br><br>Growing up a bit worse ah.
<br><br>"This, not very good, right?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Sir, there's nothing bad, these are all people under my subordinates, sir, feel free to pick." Wu Tian laughed.
<br><br>"People under your subordinates?"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his eyebrows.
<br><br>All right.
<br><br>Then just call two, help pour the wine also. Premiere domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Waving his hand, the two women sat beside Yi Feng.
<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei is the choice of all.
<br><br>Yi Feng also did not say anything, after all, is also to such an occasion, rare happy.
<br><br>Seeing this, Wu Tian steeply laughed out loud, really his big brother is still his big brother ah.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>On the side, Yuan Jing was not at all happy.
<br><br>Because she recognized that this row of women were all the heavenly daughters of several large clans within the Wu Tian empire, and there was even a princess from the royal family present.
<br><br>These women's status was much more noble than hers.
<br><br>In terms of strength, in terms of looks they also completely dumped her by several blocks.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Yet, they were only the playthings of Yi Feng and others.
<br><br>She once again found.
<br><br>The gap between herself and Yi Feng is not generally large.
<br><br>The heart of those small thoughts, is completely no longer dare to reveal, self-defeating.
<br><br>Such a person.
<br><br>And how will look at her?
<br><br>In the midst of drinking, Wu Tian couldn't wait to report to Yi Feng about his achievements over the years, as well as to introduce those people he had brought.
<br><br>So he was busy asking, "Sir, what do you think of those people I brought, what do you think?"
<br><br>Yi Feng paused, looked at him, and said lightly, "Truth?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>Wu Tian said expectantly.
<br><br>"Super trash."
<br><br>Yi Feng shook his head.
<br><br>Wu Tian, who was expecting to be appreciated by Yi Feng, was instantly as uncomfortable as constipation.
<br><br>He had thought that Mr. would appreciate his insightfulness and be able to train such a group of experts, but he didn't expect such a result.
<br><br>He had selected the best elites, but they were still not in the eyes of the gentleman?
<br><br>Next to him, Yuan Jing and the saintly maiden accompanying the wine did not know what to say, and were silent and did not dare to speak.
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>The helpless Wu Tian could only accept it.
<br><br>After all, he also knew what kind of person Yi Feng was, and when he thought about it, I'm afraid these people really didn't fall into his eyes.
<br><br>But these people did not fall into the eyes of the gentleman, if he knew that he was now the king of the Wu Tian Empire, the gentleman thought that he would be very pleased, right?
<br><br>So he smiled and said, "Sir, in fact, my identity today is ......"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as he was halfway through, Yi Feng pressed his palm to interrupt his words and continued, "You don't say anymore, I probably know everything."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Wu Tian's eyes were startled.
<br><br>"Sir, you know?"
<br><br>"Of course!"
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head with discretionary wine.
<br><br>Wu Tian what this guy's line of work, his heart is already a guess of eight or nine.
<br><br>Must be a mountain thief plus pimp.
<br><br>Because he brought the group of big men, he could see at a glance, are licking blood on the knife mouth of the characters, either one-eyed dragon, or several centimeters of scars on the face, this is not a mountain bandit is what?
<br><br>As for pimping, it goes without saying.
<br><br>Just now Wu Tian has personally admitted that the girl next to him to accompany the drink, is his people.
<br><br>Wu Tian deeply admired.
<br><br>Mr. is really Mr. ah.
<br><br>Before he could say it himself, he already knew it.
<br><br>"So sir, Chickie didn't let you down, right?" Wu Tian asked impatiently, hoping that Yi Feng would praise him.
<br><br>He had this look.
<br><br>Like a child in class who wanted to be appreciated in front of the teacher because he had done his homework.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Instead, Yi Feng put down his glass, shook his head, and said indifferently, "Very disappointed!"
<br><br>Wu Tian was instantly dumbfounded.
<br><br>On the side, Yuan Jing Yuan Jing and the saint maidens who accompanied the wine were also staring and staggered.
<br><br>The king of the country was still unable to satisfy him?
<br><br>Wu Tian was filled with doubts and asked, "Sir, why, why?"
<br><br>"It's not the right way."
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his wine glass and shook his head.
<br><br>"Not the righteous way?"
<br><br>Wu Tian was completely dumbfounded.
<br><br>The king of a country is not the righteous way even in the eyes of a gentleman?
<br><br>"Alas, in fact, I have taught you before, people, ah, still need to have some ambition, set your vision farther." Yi Feng put down his wine glass and softly admonished, "You currently look a bit scenic and seem dashing, but in reality?"
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Wu Tian's body trembled violently.
<br><br>"Be ambitious, set your sights far ......"
<br><br>The mouth is also secretly murmured Yi Feng's words, then his gaze brightened and suddenly realized.
<br><br>It was only then that he suddenly recalled that he had lost his goal since he became the king of the country all these years, and was complacent all day because of his achievements.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words now could be considered to have awakened him at once.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>A king is nothing.
<br><br>How can the ambition be limited to a small empire.
<br><br>It should be like Mr., planning and planning, holding the whole world in his hands.
<br><br>"Sir, I understand!"
<br><br>Wu Tian gratefully knelt on the ground.
<br><br>After having enough wine and food, Wu Tian left.
<br><br>Because he felt that he did not deserve to stay by Yi Feng's side, a small state ruler status, it was a bit embarrassing to Yi Feng.
<br><br>But before he left, Yi Feng took him as his disciple.
<br><br>Originally, Yi Feng would like to take him as a formal disciple, but this guy's talent is also a garbage, although better than super garbage, but not enough to ordinary.
<br><br>And this great incentive instantly made Wu Tian's blood boil.
<br><br>Secretly vowed to break out some fame, enough to qualify to see Yi Feng again.
<br><br>Genting Empire.
<br><br>Extinction and the Genting kingdom ruler stared at the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar in front of them with dead eyes.
<br><br>Only when they saw that the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar had recovered a lot did their faces finally look better.
<br><br>After all, they had done a lot of things to restore their Qi luck during this period of time according to the instructions from above.
<br><br>"Let's take a look at the next thing!"
<br><br>The Genting kingdom ruler said.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>Perdition held the Guidance Heavenly Book and watched the guidance on it.
<br><br>"Wu Tian, the ruler of the Wu Tian Empire, is the son of great qi luck, the next instruction is to draw him in for our use." Destruction World said.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"What a heavenly help."
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch laughed out loud when he heard that.
<br><br>"How?"
<br><br>Perishable asked in a hurry.
<br><br>"This Wu Tian Empire has been a vassal state of my Genting Empire since ancient times, so having that Wu Tian come over is just a matter of a holy decree." The Genting king laughed and said.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The eyes of the World of Destruction also lit up.
<br><br>He did not think there was such a good thing.
<br><br>"As long as we control him, this person is a member of the Genting Empire, and his fortune will naturally grow." Extinction said excitedly.
<br><br>"Good, I will order my subordinates to do it right away."
<br><br>The Genting king immediately ordered and sent his men to the Wu Tian Empire.
<br><br>Seeing the people dispatched, Exterminating World and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch looked at each other and couldn't help but smile.
<br><br>They began to sit and wait.
<br><br>They were not afraid that this Wu Tian would not come.
<br><br>After all, Wu Tian Empire is a vassal state of his Genting Empire, Genting summoned, as a vassal state ruler, he had to come.
<br><br>In order to facilitate the control of the vassal state, some large empires will use the empire's qi, set the vassal seal to the vassal state.
<br><br>The new king of a vassal state will automatically be marked with this vassal seal until he retires from the throne or dies.
<br><br>With the existence of this mark, the Genting Empire can control the life and death of the vassal king at any time.
<br><br>This is why there is almost no rebellion in the Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>So to say.
<br><br>Unless Wu Tian dies or is not the king of this country, it is possible to disobey his cloud top's holy orders.
<br><br>PS: I feel that these chapters are not very well written, sorry ha, I will adjust as soon as possible, this kind of text is not very well written, forgive me.
<br><br>There is also Wu Tian, he is a character who appeared before the timeline of the beginning of the book, so the previous article is not appeared, which is a common technique.
