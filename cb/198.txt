Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The surface is quiet and peaceful.
<br><br>In addition to the sects sent some scouts to follow the movement of the stone gate, the cemetery around almost no one, as if the last time has been afraid of the general.
<br><br>But secretly, the wind is rising.
<br><br>More and more experts are arriving, hiding in Pingjiang City, waiting for the organs to run out, and then go for the treasure.
<br><br>Green Mountain Sect.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan and Yun Xianque sat in the main hall.
<br><br>"Miss Yun, how is it staying in my Castle Peak Sect?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>Escaping from the ghost gate, Yun Xian Que was less sharp, and bowed her head towards Old Ancestor Qing Shan and said, "Thank you, Old Man Lu, for not taking into account the past, and apologize for my disrespect last time, if I could listen to your advice at that time, I'm afraid that Uncle Lin wouldn't be so ......"
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yun Xian Que face bleak, very lost.
<br><br>"What, is the situation of Lin Lao not good?" Old Ancestor Qing Shan asked busily. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que nodded and said, "Although he was sent back to Feng Yun Valley in time, but the damage brought by that phantom beast was still beyond expectation, although he recovered a life, but Lin Bo fell through from the Martial Exaltation realm to Martial Emperor, and there is no possibility of refinement in this life!"
<br><br>Lu Qingshan opened his mouth in a complicated way, and did not know what to say.
<br><br>A martial dweller fell directly to the martial emperor, which is actually no different from being ruined.
<br><br>The more I thought about this, the more the old ancestor of Castle Peak felt reverence for Yi Feng.
<br><br>If not for Mr. remind.
<br><br>He Qingshan old ancestor, I'm afraid it is not good ah!
<br><br>Although everyone knew that there must be risks in the tomb, what Yi Feng said to him was obviously a reminder that there were risks beyond their limits in the tomb.
<br><br>And it was, indeed, true.
<br><br>"Elder Lu, in fact, I came here to ask who is so powerful that he can actually predict beforehand and know that there is such a danger in the tomb?" Slightly pondering, Yun Xian Que asked again.
<br><br>In her heart, she had always been extremely curious about the person that Old Ancestor Qingshan said.
<br><br>"Miss Yun, the gentleman returns to the basics, feels the ordinary life, and does not like to be disturbed." Lu Qingshan shook his head and said, "So I'm sorry, I can't tell you."
<br><br>"Okay, fine!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que nodded his head disappointedly.
<br><br>"At the same time, I also advise Miss Yun that it is best not to pry into Sir privately, even though I know that Feng Yun Valley is very powerful, but if it causes Sir's dislike, I am afraid that Feng Yun Valley does not have the weight to withstand Sir's anger!" Lu Qingshan eyes narrowed, and solemnly reminded.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was not angry, but was surprised.
<br><br>It seems that the person Lu Qingshan said, is more powerful than she imagined ah!
<br><br>Otherwise, Lu Qingshan, as a half-exalted expert, would not have said these words.
<br><br>She nodded her head.
<br><br>Since Lu Qingshan was unwilling to say more, she didn't ask any more questions, but changed the topic and said, "Elder Lu, the other two Martial Exalts of my Fengyun Valley are on their way to get the Holy Relics as well as other resources, and now that the danger inside the tomb has passed, there is only a need to compete with other forces, so I am inviting you once again to make an alliance with my Fengyun Valley, what do you think? "
<br><br>"After all, you should have heard that there are many other resources in that great hall altar besides the holy relics, which should be very important to your Qingshan Sect, right?"
<br><br>At those words, Lu Qingshan fell into deep thought.
<br><br>To be honest, he was indeed moved.
<br><br>Because the danger had indeed passed, and the words of the gentleman had also been fulfilled, which meant that there should be no more great danger inside the tomb.
<br><br>However, he did not immediately agree, but after thinking about it, he said, "Let's do this, Miss Yun, anyway, there is still some time before the organs inside the tomb dissipate, and before that, there is no fear that someone will be first, so you allow me to think about it for a day or two, and then make plans?"
<br><br>"All right, I'll wait for your news."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que got up and left.
<br><br>"Should I go or not?"
<br><br>After Yun Xian Que left, Lu Qingshan closed his eyes and pondered, after a long time he still decided to ask Mr.
<br><br>"Ding!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the host, the calligraphy has reached a level comparable to God!"
<br><br>In the martial arts school, Yi Feng put down the brush in his hand, listened to the voice coming from his mind, and revealed a satisfied smile.
<br><br>Of the four skills of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting, except for chess, the other three were finally on par with God.
<br><br>As long as the skill of chess was also raised to be on par with God, then this task of qin, chess, calligraphy and painting would be completed.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>He completed the task just to not recall the martial arts school, as for the reward he did not have the slightest expectation.
<br><br>Mount?
<br><br>Heh!
<br><br>Not to mention the expectation, and even a little headache.
<br><br>Because there is a broken skull is almost, if there is another one almost, may be when the heart attack.
<br><br>Just at this time, outside the door came the voice of Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>Only to see that he carried a few more pots of good wine, which seemed to be a few points better than last time.
<br><br>"Look at you old man, just come, and carry what else." Yi Feng laughed and teased, but his hands hurriedly took the several pots of good wine from Lu Qingshan's hands.
<br><br>"What did you say, sir, it's all as it should be, and thank you for the reminder last time." Lu Qingshan said gratefully.
<br><br>"Last time's reminder, what reminder?" Yi Feng was a bit puzzled.
<br><br>Seeing this, Lu Qingshan was secretly shocked, the Martial Saint's tomb, sir really didn't take it to heart at all!
<br><br>So he explained: "is the last time I talked to you about the tomb of the matter, as you expected, there was a big trouble died a lot of people, and I was reminded by Mr. did not go, this is how to recover a life."
<br><br>"So it is this ah, expected."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and laughed, in fact, this is not even a matter of thought, a cultivator's tomb, how could there be no danger!
<br><br>See Yi Feng this light-hearted, Lu Qingshan face reverence.
<br><br>I'm afraid that only Mr. this state of mind, can say so breezy.
<br><br>"Uh ...... sir, in fact, this time I came, or want to ask about the tomb, since the danger inside that tomb has already happened, whether there is no big danger to go in again?" The old ancestor of Green Mountain spoke up again and asked.
<br><br>"You still want to go in?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at him in amazement.
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan nodded his head in embarrassment.
<br><br>After all, according to the news coming from Cloud Immortal Que, there were many pills and techniques inside that graveyard besides the holy relics, which might not be of much use to him, Old Ancestor Qingshan, but were essential for the development of a sect.
<br><br>"Alas, you ah you."
<br><br>Seeing that Old Ancestor Qingshan really intended to do so, Yi Feng shook his head helplessly.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng sighing, Old Ancestor Qingshan's heart tightened and he was busy asking, "What is the meaning of sir's sigh?"
