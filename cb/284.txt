With that bad feeling getting stronger and stronger, Desolate Pathless finally couldn't sit still.
<br><br>"Older brother, you guys wait for me here, I'll go and look for him." Desolate Wuji said.
<br><br>"No problem, old brother take care of safety." Yi Feng got up and said.
<br><br>"You do not have to worry about me, but you, must not move around, just wait here for me hear?" Desolate pathless again and again instructed.
<br><br>"Okay, old brother do not worry!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said hurriedly.
<br><br>Seeing Yi Feng nodding, Desolate Wuji then let out a sigh of relief and walked into the mist.
<br><br>Because in his opinion, although the mists blocked his vision, they could not block his divine sense.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>His face changed.
<br><br>Because he expected wrong, the mist actually really blocked his divine sense. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This was no longer an ordinary mist, but some kind of formation or taboo.
<br><br>Even Desolate Pathless faintly felt that it was coming for him.
<br><br>This made him gaze, and for a while there was no way to deal with it, because with his vision and divine sense affected, even he had become blind.
<br><br>And to deal with this situation, the only way is to remain unchanged in response to changes.
<br><br>Thinking of this, he turned back decisively.
<br><br>In a short while, he saw Yi Feng waiting for him there with Bone Ben Wei and Dog.
<br><br>He hurriedly walked forward.
<br><br>But just two steps out, a heaven-destroying feeling came towards him.
<br><br>Sensing this crisis, Desolate Pathless Martial Emperor strength was unleashed without reservation, and with a flip of his palm, a thick palm slapped out towards the front.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The space in front of him resounded with a sudden turmoil.
<br><br>Desolate WuJi gave a stifled grunt, his body gushed, but the crisis was finally gone.
<br><br>But Desolate Wuji did not dare to move anymore.
<br><br>His face was unprecedentedly grave.
<br><br>Because just now that attack, is obviously some kind of forbidden formation issued, and can issue such a powerful attack, is obviously a killing formation.
<br><br>No need to think, he was now in the middle of a killing formation.
<br><br>He raised his head and looked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>Yi Feng, who had risen to meet him, had disappeared.
<br><br>So he instantly judged that it wasn't that he was unlucky and had stepped into a killing formation unintentionally.
<br><br>Rather, someone deliberately targeted, first with a maze formation to limit vision and divine sense, and then with an illusion formation to attract, step by step, let him walk into a set up killing formation.
<br><br>This step-by-step tactic was really flawlessly designed.
<br><br>"Tsk, Desolate Pathless, we've been waiting for you for a long time, finally we've waited for you."
<br><br>At this time, three figures came out from the mist, and a cold laughing voice came out.
<br><br>"It's you guys, the Five Elements of Chaos?"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji's face changed.
<br><br>"Good, it's us, that day you killed our big brother, today we've come to seek revenge on you." One of the red-haired men said.
<br><br>"Humph, that day Jin Xing killed the innocent, trying to refine the evil power with the lives of ten thousand people, although I am not a saint, but I can't see this kind of behavior, killing him is to do justice for the heaven." Desolate pathless said in a deep voice: "Moreover, the strongest of the five of you, Shui Xing, is not here, do you really think that with the three of you, is my opponent?"
<br><br>"Hmph, you don't know how to repent even when you're dead!"
<br><br>The red-haired man said in a deep voice: "Against you, there is no need for the second sister to take action, with the three of us can easily deal with you, after all, you are now in the middle of the killing array it ......"
<br><br>Desolate pathless brow imperceptibly wrinkled.
<br><br>The usual moment, as long as not to encounter that water line, he simply do not fear these people, but at the moment he is in the killing formation even one step can not move, in this case to deal with these three, is indeed very difficult.
<br><br>"Cut the crap, brothers send him on his way!"
<br><br>The red-haired man, Firewalker, emitted an icy cold voice.
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Wood Row took the lead to cast hand seals.
<br><br>"Wood, Binding."
<br><br>Along with a cold cry, the ground where Desolate Wuji's feet were stepping on cracked violently, followed by countless tree roots spreading up like long snakes, spreading from Desolate Wuji's legs to his hands, attempting to bind him tightly.
<br><br>And after the wood line, the means of the earth line was simultaneously cast out.
<br><br>"Earth, Great Gravity Technique."
<br><br>After a cold cry, Desolate Wujing immediately felt under tremendous pressure, and his legs directly collapsed into the ground.
<br><br>In this situation, Desolate Wujing's face was distorted and cold sweat was pouring down.
<br><br>Not to mention the fact that the killing formation itself restricted his range of motion, the woodbound binding technique and the earthbound gravity technique were undoubtedly adding to his woes.
<br><br>"Desolate Pathless."
<br><br>"Go to hell and repent, right?"
<br><br>Looking at this appearance of Desolate Wuji, Fire Xing's face was filled with hatred, accompanied by a hideous laughter, he quickly formed a seal in his hand.
<br><br>"Fire, hell fire."
<br><br>At the same time the voice fell, a huge ball of flame coalesced out of thin air.
<br><br>It was like a hot little sun, carrying a terrifying energy.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The surrounding temperature soared.
<br><br>The air seemed to be on the verge of burning up.
<br><br>"Die!"
<br><br>Finally, this monstrous ball of fire pushed out towards Desolate Wujing.
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolate Wujing's eyes widened.
<br><br>If it was in normal times, he would have a way to block this strike, but in the current situation, he could not resist at all.
<br><br>The corners of his eyes.
<br><br>A look of reluctance appeared.
<br><br>Is this the end of his life, Desolate Wuji?
