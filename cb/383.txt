However, just when the two were looking sad and wanted to leave in secret, Yi Feng suddenly called out to them.
<br><br>"Aiya, old man Lu, Miss Luo Lan, it's you two, long time no see."
<br><br>Master and disciple Lu Qingshan both trembled.
<br><br>What's more, they were a bit filled with hot tears.
<br><br>They never expected that sir would actually take the initiative to greet them.
<br><br>It seemed that after not seeing them for a long time, sir still remembered them.
<br><br>"Greetings, sir."
<br><br>The two men hurriedly greeted respectfully.
<br><br>"Aiya, old friends, what's the point of being polite, let's go, come and eat together." Yi Feng said with a direct familiar wave of his hand.
<br><br>"This, will not be inconvenient ah?"
<br><br>"After all, so many of you are ...... and I'm just a ......" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Lu Qingshan looked at the dozens behind Yi Feng, his face showed hesitation ......
<br><br>Yi Feng brought so many top big brothers, he a small role that can not even touch the edge of the Martial Emperor, how good it is to get together.
<br><br>"Aiya, you old man, when did you become so polite?"
<br><br>Yi Feng suddenly gave him a white glance, said leisurely: "All are bottom scum, what's different for you and me? All the same, all friends, come, eat!"
<br><br>What Yi Feng said was not wrong.
<br><br>Some are the workers who move bricks and build walls for him, one is for his niece's cultivation nine gold coins can not get together Lu Qingshan, are the same poor people, there is nothing who is more noble than who.
<br><br>Of course, he did not mean to look down on everyone.
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng waved his hand and went to discuss matters with the steward of the restaurant.
<br><br>While Lu Qingshan master and disciple listened to Yi Feng's words, they let out a bitter laugh.
<br><br>Yes!
<br><br>In front of Sir, Martial Emperor or Martial Spirit Martial King, what difference does it make?
<br><br>All are just dregs at the bottom.
<br><br>So does it matter what strength they are?
<br><br>It doesn't matter.
<br><br>Anyway, they are not Mr. strong, kill up is a matter of a slap.
<br><br>Thinking of this, Lu Qingshan also regained his previous open-mindedness and followed Yi Feng.
<br><br>Yi Feng found the steward of Baofeng Restaurant.
<br><br>Because of the relationship between Yi Feng's previous book and the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, he had come here to eat several times, so the steward was very understanding, even though today the restaurant is very good business inside, the seats are crowded, but he also arranged through the arrangement, Yi Feng and others arranged a few large tables.
<br><br>Of course, it is also inseparable from this hall inside many people eating are Yi Feng usual old acquaintances, have vacated the place not to say, one familiar greeting towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"These people are not simple ah!"
<br><br>"This town, what are some people ah?"
<br><br>"It seems like there's not a single ordinary person sitting inside this hall!"
<br><br>"This Dongsheng actually has such a city, I actually didn't know!"
<br><br>"Hiss!"
<br><br>"Look at the old man at the table over there, is it the former roving killers of Dongsheng, I don't know when the silence relics, actually appeared here."
<br><br>"And that scar face drinking over there, does it look like the devil who appeared in our East Victory three years ago and killed a lot of people in Central China?"
<br><br>Looking at the people inside this hall, the group of Martial Emperors who had been recruited by Shaking Heavenly Que and the others to move the bricks, there were small but shocked voices coming out, each one pumping backwards with a cool breath, full of incredulity.
<br><br>"Come, come, come, everyone sit."
<br><br>"Everyone has worked hard during this time, feel free to eat whatever you want."
<br><br>Yi Feng said atmospherically.
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>The crowd regained their senses from the shock and sat down nervously.
<br><br>Although we all work together on the island on a regular basis, but all busy with their own work, rarely have the opportunity to get together.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>This scene for many people, even if they do not get the opportunity today, to sit here, but also enough to make them proud of it.
<br><br>Yi Feng, the party first not to mention.
<br><br>Other people sitting here, the lowest are Martial Emperor!
<br><br>In addition, I'm afraid there are some unfathomable, I'm afraid long ago become immortal experts!
<br><br>If in addition to some other people sitting in the hall, this kind of pomp and circumstance, simply ......
<br><br>Tsk.
<br><br>Even if the identity of these people is not low, this kind of occasion is never experienced!
<br><br>"Come on, before we eat, I'll play a piano for everyone, to help the spirit."
<br><br>Yi Feng deliberately brought out his broken acoustic guitar, plucked the strings, and said with a smile.
<br><br>On hearing that, many people present were invigorated.
<br><br>And Shake Tian Que and Guan Yun Peng even directly winked at those who were moving bricks and reminded in a low voice, "Sit down all, the chance is coming."
<br><br>Hearing this, the crowd was excited beyond words, revealing their expectant eyes.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>To be honest, he liked the feeling of this kind of gathering.
<br><br>In his previous life, he would often get together with his friends, carrying a guitar, drinking a little wine, cheering in song, chatting and farting.
<br><br>Although crossed to here, still have to love life ah!
<br><br>"Dang ......"
<br><br>Strings plucked, a cheerful piano sounded, accompanied by the crowd's clapping beat, the atmosphere was active to the extreme.
<br><br>At the same time they also felt the power of the great dao in Yi Feng's zither sound, even those who knew nothing about the zither also got a great benefit in this moment.
<br><br>The second floor stairs around the corner.
<br><br>A woman in a white dress, with a light veil, with a beautiful body and fair skin stood there.
<br><br>Quietly looking at Yi Feng who was surrounded by the crowd, the red lips under the light veil, slightly outlined.
<br><br>"This Immortal River Continent, is getting more and more interesting."
<br><br>"It seems that some of the old guys who used to be silent, are popping up one after another."
<br><br>"I just don't know which one this youth in front of me is ......"
<br><br>She looked up through the window and glanced at the distant sky, sighing out.
<br><br>Suddenly.
<br><br>She suddenly perceived that someone had fixed his gaze on her.
<br><br>He was busy looking his gaze over.
<br><br>She found a black-robed man standing behind Yi Feng, raising his palm and throwing a flying kiss at her.
<br><br>"Were you found out?"
<br><br>"Interesting."
<br><br>She murmured unexpectedly, glanced at Bone Ben Wei, then glanced at Yi Feng, then disappeared.
<br><br>Probably no one knew that she had been here except for Bones Ben Wei ......
<br><br>A zither fell, the restaurant was filled with countless enthusiastic and frenzied shouts, and the atmosphere once again reached its zenith.
<br><br>"Come, serve the wine."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a big smile.
<br><br>Then an altar of wine was brought to the table, and the crowd began to drink and chat with great joy.
<br><br>Outside the door of the restaurant.
<br><br>Six men in green landed and came.
<br><br>"The whole Pingjiang City has turned around, there is no news of the ancient statue, what should we do?" One of them said in a deep voice.
<br><br>The remaining five people frowned.
<br><br>If the explanation was not done properly, they could not give a good account of the matter.
<br><br>At that moment, one of them saw the restaurant next to them and said, "It's best to inquire about the news among the restaurants, why don't you go and try your luck?"
<br><br>The remaining few people looked at each other and nodded their heads.
<br><br>Six people, expressionless, walked into the tavern.
<br><br>"Sorry guest, there is no room on this side, please change one!"
<br><br>Seeing the visitors, the shopkeeper immediately welcomed them and explained with a smile.
<br><br>But the six people did not even look at the shopkeeper, randomly looking at a table and walked up.
<br><br>"You guys, get lost."
<br><br>One of them, a man in green, emitted an unquestionable voice.
