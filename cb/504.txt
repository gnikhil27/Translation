But Burial Five's explanation made the three people dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Fakes are not so much, and the immortal weapons are indeed immortal weapons, only that these immortal weapons are all trash in my Heaven and Earth Sect, no one uses them, that's why I said they are discarded items."
<br><br>Burial five while and burial one explained, while inclined head towards burial four said: "four brother you too, senior brother and sister are pursuing the dao, is the mystery, is the law, we should also look to them, you always focus on these external immortal weapons what is the use? And bring out this pile of hot chickens that no one uses to invite people to show their faces, it's simply a disgrace to the master!"
<br><br>"Hehehe, I was wrong I was wrong."
<br><br>Burial Four rubbed his head in embarrassment and said, "It's my brother's fault for not thinking properly, I wanted to bring these out to pretend, but I didn't expect to disgrace my master, I'll put them away."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The three people listening to the conversation between the two brothers on the side, their mouths had long since turned into duck mouths, and their bodies were petrified in place.
<br><br>Is this still the fourth brother and fifth brother they are familiar with?
<br><br>Listen to this conversation, like a human said?
<br><br>"Big brother, second brother, third brother, open your mouth."
<br><br>At this time, burial five shouted again. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The three people subconsciously opened their mouths.
<br><br>The three pills fell into their mouths and turned into a warm stream that surged throughout their bodies.
<br><br>In an instant.
<br><br>The three people just recovered most of their injuries, and even their cultivation level was refined.
<br><br>"This, this is?"
<br><br>Three people will look at the burial five, full of shock.
<br><br>"Three brothers don't be surprised, before leaving home, because of my sweet mouth, the second protector gave me a few dog food." Burial Five waved his hand and said unconcernedly.
<br><br>"Dog ......"
<br><br>"Food?"
<br><br>The three Burial One stared and drew in a cold breath.
<br><br>This Heaven and Earth Gate, what kind of place is it?
<br><br>Immortal weapons were spicy chicken discarded items.
<br><br>The elixir that allowed them to recover from their injuries in seconds was dog food.
<br><br>For a while, they were left speechless with surprise.
<br><br>"By the way, that trash injured the three brothers, I'll help the three brothers take revenge by chopping him up."
<br><br>Seeing that the three were better injured, Burial Five waved the long knife in his hand and walked towards Fang Xiaotian.
<br><br>"What are you doing?"
<br><br>"Don't kill me, it's all my fault for doing something stupid in a moment of confusion."
<br><br>"I was wrong, please don't kill me."
<br><br>Seeing this, Fang Xiaotian begged for mercy in fear.
<br><br>At the same time, his face was filled with fear, holding his injured arm and retreating hastily.
<br><br>In the heart, is also regretful intestines green.
<br><br>But who would have thought that a month ago, the burial five was still a Golden Immortal, and now meet again is already a Xuan Xian?
<br><br>"Wait old five, let him go, he is a heaven-destined person, you can't kill him."
<br><br>At this moment, Burial One shouted towards Burial Five.
<br><br>Although he also wanted to kill Fang Xiaotian, he also knew in his heart that there was nothing he could do to take Fang Xiaotian.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>The Heaven-destined man was destined by Heaven.
<br><br>The moment the Immortal River Chaos Tablet opened, the 234 heaven-destined people would definitely exist in the world.
<br><br>Even if you have a stronger strength than the other party and launch a killing move, there will be an unforeseen change due to the heavenly numbers, thus bringing him back from the dead.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>It is all mysterious and mysterious.
<br><br>But the truth is this, even if Burial Five has the strength to kill Fang Xiaotian in seconds, it is impossible to achieve at this moment.
<br><br>After all.
<br><br>This belongs to fight with the sky.
<br><br>Even the strongest.
<br><br>And how to fight the sky?
<br><br>And how to change the arrangement of the heavens?
<br><br>Fang Xiaotian heard the words, is also an instant reaction, originally begging for mercy, he was also suddenly not afraid.
<br><br>Suddenly stood up and laughed wildly.
<br><br>"Haha, so what if you are stronger than me, so what if you are a Xuan Xian, I am the one who is destined by the heavens."
<br><br>"Heaven won't even let me die, then no one will be able to kill me."
<br><br>"Little bastard, you are very angry, this arm of revenge, in the future, I will return a thousand times a thousand times."
<br><br>"Wait for me!"
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>But just halfway through his laughter, it suddenly came to a screeching halt.
<br><br>The smugness on his face also froze instantly.
<br><br>Staring incredulously at the large knife that fell on his neck.
<br><br>"How ......"
<br><br>"How, I am a man of heaven's determination ......"
<br><br>As soon as the words fell, with an unwilling gaze, he fell directly to the ground and became a headless corpse.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Old Five, how did you do that?"
<br><br>"He is a heaven-destined person, you were actually able to kill him?"
<br><br>The three Burial One brothers also steepled their eyes wide and asked incredulously.
<br><br>"What's wrong with the Heaven-determined person, the heavens can't control the people of our Heaven and Earth Sect."
<br><br>Burial Five sneered and gave another slash, directly causing Fang Xiaotian's soul to fly away, even if the Heavenly Dao was near, he couldn't save him anymore.
<br><br>Things.
<br><br>Finally came to an end.
<br><br>But the burial class and others for a long time in shock can not extricate themselves.
<br><br>If not seen with their own eyes, who would have thought that there is such a sect in the world as the Heaven and Earth Sect?
<br><br>And ask, facing such a powerful sect, who can remain unmoved?
<br><br>Thus, the three Burial One people came up, rubbed their heads, and said embarrassedly, "Uh, fourth brother, fifth brother, that that ...... can we also join the Heaven and Earth Sect?"
<br><br>As they said this, all three of them turned red in the face.
<br><br>After all, they hadn't forgotten that they had previously said that they would not go to the Heaven and Earth Sect even if they were killed.
<br><br>"Of course you can, this time the two of us came back just to invite the three brothers to join the Heaven and Earth Sect together." Burial Five laughed.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>The three people's eyes instantly lit up.
<br><br>But there was still some concern in their hearts, so they asked again, "But does the Heaven and Earth Sect look at us, after all, it is so powerful, it won't not look at us, right?"
<br><br>"What are you saying, three brothers, ordinary people who want to join is naturally impossible, but if you have the flyer in hand, you can easily, because to be able to receive the flyer, it proves that itself and the Heaven and Earth Gate have a destiny!" Burial Four hurriedly explained.
<br><br>"So it's possible with a flyer, that's great!"
<br><br>The three of them immediately let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>"Then when will the three brothers depart?" Burial Four asked.
<br><br>"We still have some things to pack, and when we're done, we'll depart immediately." Burial One said.
<br><br>"En, then since we are not leaving immediately, we will go back first and wait for the three brothers to arrive at the Heaven and Earth Gate." Burial Four said.
<br><br>"Okay, no problem, we'll be here soon."
<br><br>The three Burial One sent the two off.
<br><br>When the dust settled, the two didn't have second thoughts and rushed back directly towards the Heaven and Earth Gate.
<br><br>After all, their hearts were still thinking about the endless avenues of the Hidden Book Pavilion.
<br><br>"Unexpectedly, unexpectedly, we were really blind before!" After sending the two away, Burial One couldn't help but lament, "It's still Fifth Brother's wise eyes that recognize the pearls!"
<br><br>"Yes, just one month let fifth brother become a Xuan Xian, this kind of immortal blessed land, I can't wait to rush to ha." Burial Three said.
<br><br>"I can't wait to go too." Burial Two said.
<br><br>"Good, then the three of us brothers will leave as soon as possible."
<br><br>"Hahahaha ......"
<br><br>Burial One laughed out loud, secretly thinking that he would soon be able to reach that sect as well and become a Xuan Xian for a month as well.
<br><br>Really looking forward to ah!
<br><br>But laughing and laughing.
<br><br>Then suddenly found that something is not right.
<br><br>The face immediately sank, wildly smacked himself and shouted: "Damn, I lost my leaflet to the lava land, sealed in the ground."
