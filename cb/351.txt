Say it, Yi Feng turned around and left.
<br><br>Continue to go to work on the kiln firing.
<br><br>The reason why the group of guys were expended is that Yi Feng also wanted to save his mind.
<br><br>And Bones Ben Wei can play with animals so well that he might really help him catch a few nice beasts back.
<br><br>After all, his large backyard is not enough for just four beasts.
<br><br>Yi Feng is quite satisfied with the current planning.
<br><br>The trees that need to be carved have those two old men in charge, the workers that need to shake the sky queue are recruiting, and now there is a skeleton Ben Wei to catch the beasts, he just needs to preside over the whole situation on the island.
<br><br>"Qing ah, see it or not see it."
<br><br>After Yi Feng left, Bone Ben Wei got up and couldn't help but say, "It seems that your master also knows about you, after all, usually the master doesn't let us run around, this time surprisingly he let us go out, not because of this, but because of what else."
<br><br>"So ah, you do not see the master usually that stingy look, to us sour chirp, mouth does not say, but in fact for everyone is quite good, you have to remember in your heart, you have to be grateful ah!"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei taught a long lesson in a serious way. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Brother, no need for you to say, for the kindness of the master I have remembered in my heart, when I was treated as a falling dog, it was the master who saved me."
<br><br>"And I have also changed from a small little demon to the big demon I am today, all because of my master."
<br><br>"The most important thing is that without the master, how would I have known a good big brother like you?" The dog said with a deep emotion.
<br><br>"That's a good point."
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei was satisfied, then waved his hand and said, "Let's go, brothers, let's set out for the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Tribe and pick up Xiao Qingzi."
<br><br>"Oh heh."
<br><br>"Oooh, go."
<br><br>Excited voices came from the brothers, leading the few demons tethered to the tree and started running.
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>"Roar!"
<br><br>However, angry voices came from the black feather and other demons tethered to the tree on the side.
<br><br>In their opinion, the whole reason why they ended up in such a situation with their status was because of that damned human.
<br><br>And they couldn't exert their cultivation and break free from their bonds because that human had placed chains on them.
<br><br>But it would have been better if this human had dominated them.
<br><br>Despite being hateful, they had to admit that this human was really terrifying, so terrifying that it should not exist in the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>So, in front of that human, they endured for the time being.
<br><br>But damn it, when did a skeleton death spirit, a centipede, a dog, and a bear get to dominate them?
<br><br>Where was the majesty of being a demon immortal?
<br><br>Especially Black Feather.
<br><br>Where did such a mole-like thing have the guts to dominate him?
<br><br>So just now, with the same idea in mind, the four beasts emitted a roar at the same time.
<br><br>Despite the suppression of their cultivation level, their mighty pressure as demons on demons is real.
<br><br>Just like the four tigers, even though they were bound, the roar and the pressure they emitted could still deter ordinary little mice and rabbits.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Under their roar, this little skeleton, the little dog, would not be scared to kneel down?
<br><br>And yet.
<br><br>To their complete dismay, the brothers were not intimidated at all in the face of their intimidation.
<br><br>"What are these four silly things barking blindly about?"
<br><br>"Hell knows."
<br><br>"I guess they don't like us."
<br><br>"Oh ...... little thing, just beat it up."
<br><br>The voice fell and the brothers turned their eyes to the four black-feathered beasts.
<br><br>This pair of eyes actually really made Black Feather and the others have a creepy feeling.
<br><br>But after a few moments, they didn't care.
<br><br>Even though these guys actually ignored their anger, a few mole crickets really dare to make a move on them?
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just as such a thought rose to the surface.
<br><br>The fists, feet and sticks suddenly fell on their heads and beat them severely.
<br><br>The angry hissing sound came out from their mouths.
<br><br>They never expected that this group of molehills would really dare to beat them.
<br><br>But the reality showed them that the more they screamed, the harder that fist fell on their heads.
<br><br>The strong suffocation made them full of anger.
<br><br>This humiliation is really hard for them to bear.
<br><br>So the three of the Western Demon Forest looked at each other, and their hearts secretly hesitated whether to burn their cultivation and lives and fight back.
<br><br>But.
<br><br>They couldn't decide in their hearts, not knowing whether burning their cultivation and lives could break free from the chains.
<br><br>Unable to help, they looked at Black Feather.
<br><br>During these days, after private communication, they had long known the identity of Black Feather, a big brother from the immortal world.
<br><br>Adding to the fact that the fluctuations emanating from Black Feather made them submissive in their hearts, the three demons of the Western Demon Forest, at first, recognized Black Feather as their leader.
<br><br>So at this moment, as long as Black Feather felt that he could burn his life and cultivation to counterattack, then they would not hesitate to react.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>They, who were waiting for their Immortal Brother to make a decision, suddenly realized that their Immortal Brother, who had actually snapped to his knees, buried his head into the ground.
<br><br>?
<br><br>?
<br><br>The three major demon immortals of the Western Demon Forest were suddenly dumbfounded.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>A big brother of the Immortal World, so spineless?
<br><br>Just as they were questioning, Black Feather was busy winking at them while transmitting his voice to the three demons' minds.
<br><br>"Remember, the pattern."
<br><br>"The pattern is important.
<br><br>"Be a demon with a city and a pattern, reckless people will only die faster!"
<br><br>"The only way to be a demon on a demon is to be a demon in a gou."
<br><br>"If you stay in the green hills, you are not afraid of having no firewood to burn, first bow your head and then find the opportunity to take revenge."
<br><br>On hearing this, the three western demon forest dawned on them.
<br><br>Great admiration!
<br><br>The pattern!
<br><br>The city!
<br><br>As expected of a great demon in the immortal world, he is able to bend and stretch.
<br><br>Wouldn't they be reckless by comparison?
<br><br>Learned.
<br><br>At once, the three demons also lowered their heads.
<br><br>Seeing that the four beasts were honest, Bone Ben Wei and the others stopped and waved at the old man holding the boat in the distance.
<br><br>The old man came to support a bamboo raft, smiling without saying anything, but deep in his eyes was full of awe.
<br><br>"Let's go, brothers."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei ordered.
<br><br>The dog and the centipede hurriedly boarded the boat, and the four demonic beasts were also pulled onto the raft, but the black bear stood on the shore for a long time and refused to move.
<br><br>"Brother, I have a seal, I can't leave!"
<br><br>The black bear cried out.
<br><br>"Bullshit seal."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei behind him kicked Black Bear in the ass and sent him to the boat.
<br><br>Afterwards.
<br><br>The boat drifted towards the shore.
<br><br>"Oooh, brother, I really have a seal, I'll be struck by lightning when I disembark next." The black bear said tremblingly, his eyes staring overhead every now and then with a worried look.
<br><br>"Bear ah, the pattern is small ha." The dog said.
<br><br>"Yeah, from just now on, you are not the same person anymore." Centipede said with the same smirk.
<br><br>"Okay, well ......"
<br><br>Hearing this, the black bear only nodded his head with difficulty, but his eyes were still full of worry.
<br><br>And between the clouds, a subtle lightning light, began to slowly coalesce.
