Mao Lin's question, immediately let the three big martial spirit experts hold their faces red, the muscles on the face, but also can not help but draw animal.
<br><br>In the heart, want to kill Mao Lin's heart are there.
<br><br>His mother's eyes blind not?
<br><br>Opposite that what lineup you do not see, this lineup together to play the effect, not to mention their three martial spirits, even the three martial kings are afraid to plant here.
<br><br>Half a day and a half, the three people can not say a word.
<br><br>Only one idea in mind, that is, as soon as possible and Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce to draw a line, and then run away!
<br><br>This thing, this lineup, they can not afford to mess with!
<br><br>"Hmm? Three lords?" However, Mao Lin did not open his eyes and made another sound, blinking his eyes and casting a questioning gaze over.
<br><br>"I umm your mother."
<br><br>The martial spirit in the lead smacked Mao Lin's face, hitting his eyes with gold stars, while saying, "Chairman Mao, we've finished buying things, so we'll leave first."
<br><br>Obviously, they said this because they wanted the people of Castle Peak Sect to think that the three of them were here to buy things. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>After saying this, the three martial spirits hastily glanced at each other, and then they were ready to leave from the side, and soon they walked to the door, and no one stopped them.
<br><br>This made the three of them secretly relieved, with a smug smile on their faces.
<br><br>But just about to get out of the way, Mao Lin, who had received a slap before reacting, suddenly sent out a voice.
<br><br>"Three lords, what do you mean by this, didn't you just vow to help us get rid of these people, how come you suddenly left us hanging!"
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>These few words from Mao Lin instantly caused the three great martial spirits' faces to pale.
<br><br>Without daring to stay, the Martial Spirit aura on the three of them exploded, and as soon as their feet chopped the ground, they wanted to leave in the air.
<br><br>But just as they swept out, a dangerous aura came towards them.
<br><br>When they looked back, they saw Lu Qingshan, who was standing in the air, waving his hand, and the kitchen knife in his hand blossomed into a dazzling light, and then came out of his hand.
<br><br>Between the skies, the light of the kitchen knife became bigger and bigger, and finally reached a hundred feet, and slashed down horizontally.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>"Rumble ......"
<br><br>As a series of sonic booms rang out, countless buildings collapsed, and the blade mane left a gully hundreds of kilometers long in front of the three great martial spirits, bubbling up with sky-rocketing dust.
<br><br>The three martial spirits cold sweat, looking at the power of this chopper, but also directly stunned in place.
<br><br>Obviously this gully in front of them is nothing, and can even easily sweep over, but now it has become a gulf, so they dare not cross.
<br><br>Because the heart knows, move another step, the chopper is afraid to fall on top of their heads.
<br><br>This knife, is too terrifying!
<br><br>"It seems that you three, also involved in this matter?"
<br><br>High in the sky, the stern gaze of the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak cast over abruptly, and a majestic voice came out.
<br><br>And at the same time as he spoke, the other gazes of the Castle Peak Sect also looked over in unison.
<br><br>These gaze, looking at the three martial spirits creepy, under the pressure of this collection of people, spare to the three martial spirit experts, also can not stand, almost spiritual collapse.
<br><br>"Mao Lin, I said your grandma."
<br><br>Finally, in anger, one of the martial spirits turned back towards Mao Lin cursing, if this girl is not open-minded, at the critical moment to so a sentence, they would have fled.
<br><br>"I'm asking you, are you also involved in this matter?" The old ancestor of Qing Shan did not care about their dog bite dog, forcing the voice of questioning once again came out.
<br><br>Knowing that there is no way to avoid this matter, the three great martial spirits can only face it head-on, so they simply hardened up and said, "Yes, we did get involved."
<br><br>"But so what?"
<br><br>"Even if the three of us are not your opponents, but really want to strike at us, you have to weigh our status."
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's gaze narrowed slightly.
<br><br>"We are from the Nansha Sky Blast Gang, you have to understand that when my Sky Blast Gang was in its heyday, it was not something that your Castle Peak Sect could compare to." That martial spirit raised his proud eyes and said in a deep voice: "Even now, the Heaven Blast Gang is not as good as your Qingshan Clan, but a thin camel is bigger than a horse, if you really want to move us, you have to weigh it."
<br><br>The three great martial spirits showed a bullying momentum.
<br><br>At first, they were indeed shocked by the formation of the Castle Peak Sect, but remembering that with the Sky Blast Gang as their backing, the Castle Peak Sect really did not see the courage to make a move against them.
<br><br>And Mao Lin finally understood that the three martial spirits in front of him were not the opponents of the Castle Peak Sect people, and when he heard the words of the three, his face was flooded with light again.
<br><br>After all, they are now also a grasshopper on a rope!
<br><br>"What if, I am inclined to move you guys!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's pupils shrank slightly as he said morosely.
<br><br>"Then my Heaven Blast Gang will definitely not give up in kind, after all, we are the elders of the Heaven Blast Gang." That martial spirit threatened without any scruples, "Unless, you risk opening a sect war between your Castle Peak Sect and my Heaven Blast Gang and make a move against us."
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face flickered, unable to tell whether he was happy or angry.
<br><br>But in the next moment, he waved his palm, and his rolling voice spread across the sky.
<br><br>"Listen to my order, leave eighteen guardians to guard this place, the rest of the people will be led by Zhu Yun to set off quickly, within one day, destroy the Explosive Sky Gang for me!"
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Originally still emboldened by the three great martial spirits heard the words, the face suddenly changed greatly, the gaze deadly glared at the old ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>"You you you ......"
<br><br>"You actually want to exterminate my Explosive Sky Gang for the sake of a small matter of a mortal, how can you, how dare you?!"
