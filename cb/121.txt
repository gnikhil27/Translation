"Hiss!"
<br><br>Xu Mozhu's gaze was fixed on the old king-bird hanging on the tree, and his mouth drew a cold breath backwards.
<br><br>This old kingbug hanging on the tree seemed to be a demon emperor?
<br><br>He was a little unsure, after all, this kind of thing is too shockingly mundane.
<br><br>A demon emperor, but a demon emperor, A demon emperor has strength equal to hiimself. Xu Mozhu, ah, just hanging on the trunk of a tree?
<br><br>Can't help but, he looked to the side of Li Jiaxin.
<br><br>Li Jiaxin took a deep breath, her face showed a look of shock that could not be concealed, and also could not believe what she saw before her eyes.
<br><br>"The two of you aren't thinking about my old kingbug, are you?"
<br><br>Yi Feng saw that both have been staring at his old kingbug, can not help but board up the face, even if the two in front of him are martial cultivator he still said very hard: "This old kingbug I have to take it back to make stew for my disciple to supplement the body."
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, the heart of the two could not calm, instantly set off a thousand layers of waves.
<br><br>Like a thunderstorm!
<br><br>Demon Emperor strong.
<br><br>Taking back to stew to their disciples to supplement the body?
<br><br>Terrible as this!
<br><br>This kind of shocking mundane handwriting said, even if Xu Mo Zhu two people have seen a lot, but also a long time can not calm down.
<br><br>The two people no longer dared to have any doubts about Yi Feng's identity of possessing transcendent strength, after all, how could the existence that was going to stew the Demon Emperor in soup be mortal?
<br><br>So the two hastily explained: "Senior atonement, we do not dare to think about your ..., the demon ...... king!"
<br><br>Hearing this, Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief, but heard the two still called seniors, the heart could not help but spit, these two martial arts cultivation is stupid, caught him a mortal called seniors, is simply a strange story for the ages!
<br><br>So he added: "Both of you, I said, I'm not a senior, I'm just a mortal."
<br><br>The two people looked stunned, but quickly reacted.
<br><br>At their level, they naturally knew that there were many old monsters who liked to hide their cultivation and re-enter the mortal world to feel the ordinary life.
<br><br>I think this person in front of me is this kind of person.
<br><br>The two of them looked at each other and opened their mouths at the same time and said, "Sir, don't be angry, we didn't mean anything else, but we were attracted by the sound of your zither when we were passing by, your zither skill is simply extraordinary and superb, that's why we couldn't resist coming to disturb you!"
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng was slightly surprised and said, "You also like to play the zither?"
<br><br>"I am slightly involved, but compared to you sir, it is really a shame." Li Jiaxin hurriedly said, but this statement she slightly adulterated, for the zither she actually has a deep attainment, moreover, she has the name of zither nun.
<br><br>Only, usually let her quite proud of the qin art, in front of this one, she really feel unable to compare.
<br><br>"Slightly know some, slightly know some." And Xu Mozhu rubbed his forehead while also nodding his head hastily, although he didn't know the qin, but at the moment he didn't know it, he could only say he knew a little.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and nodded his head, his heart suddenly outline.
<br><br>No wonder two such powerful martial cultivators came to call him what senior, and so respectful, it turned out to be attracted by his zither sound.
<br><br>In terms of the zither art, although he is not a god, far from the gods, but even so, in this world is definitely considered a master, so in this regard was called a senior, but also understandable.
<br><br>"You're welcome, I'm just bored to talk about this zither!" Yi Feng lightly laughed.
<br><br>"Sir, you're welcome." The two hastily agreed: "It's just that the zither in your hand is so peculiar, we two have never seen it before, but I have to say that its sound is very unique and very pleasing to the ear."
<br><br>"Haha, peculiar, right!" Yi Feng laughed rather smugly, "This zither, ah, I made it myself, it's normal that you guys haven't seen it before."
<br><br>"So that's how it is, sir is really a great talent!"
<br><br>The two people nodded their heads in a hurry, admiration showing on their faces.
<br><br>"Since you guys like it, why don't I play another song for you?" Yi Feng asked with a smile.
<br><br>Upon hearing that, the two people's bodies shook.
<br><br>A look of surprise appeared on their faces and they cast a grateful glance at Yi Feng.
<br><br>After all, they hadn't forgotten the benefits that Yi Feng's zither sound had brought to the two of them just now, and although their strength hadn't grown, their state of mind had broken through by several points.
<br><br>The state of mind may seem useless, but it is often the bottleneck that blocks their progress.
<br><br>And mind breakthrough, cultivation breakthrough up again, when it will be unstoppable.
<br><br>And before, they only listened to half of Yi Feng's song, now if they listen to the whole song, when there will be more unexpected benefits.
<br><br>Can't help but, two people hurriedly in the green stone slab to sit down, holding their breath waiting for Yi Feng ......
