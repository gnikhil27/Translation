Boom!
<br><br>Just then, in the direction of the north, without any warning, there came a huge boom.
<br><br>The sound rumbled, like two big mountains colliding into each other, causing the entire North Sea Land to feel a strong tremor.
<br><br>At the same time.
<br><br>The sky over there became black and cloudy, just as if a black hole appeared out of thin air, and continued to spread and expand, swallowing up half of the sky.
<br><br>"This ......"
<br><br>"This can't be the legendary Lingxu Realm?"
<br><br>"So the Lingxu Realm really exists!"
<br><br>"North Sea, it's really going to change!"
<br><br>Jian Hengtian four people ignored their wretched appearance, raised their heads and stared at the sky, their eyes filled with a strong sense of incredulity.
<br><br>"To think that the Lingxu Realm, which is only rumored to exist, actually really exists." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Baier City's Night Energy father and daughter two are also equally full of shock.
<br><br>"Father, what exactly is the Lingxu Realm?"
<br><br>Night Yi asked nervously.
<br><br>"The legend of the Lingxu Realm ......"
<br><br>Night Energy took a deep breath and slowly told the story with the help of fragmented legends.
<br><br>"On the Immortal River Continent, every 100 million years is called an epoch, and during the transition of each epoch, the entire continent will fall into the Great Destruction."
<br><br>"Under the era of great destruction, people on the continent will die 90%, and only a few great powers, through reincarnation, self-sealing and various means can escape the interception of the great destruction."
<br><br>"But even if some people can be left behind, but the continental civilization will be extinct, and in order to continue the civilization, in a certain era, someone through the means of the heavenly creation of a small world."
<br><br>"And this small world is the Lingxu world."
<br><br>The night can explain one by one.
<br><br>"That's the same as saying that in this dark world, there exist people who have continued from the last epoch?" Night Yi asked gruffly.
<br><br>"Not from the last era, but from several eras ago, except that the Lingxu world has been in a closed state, and only after several eras did it see the light of day today!"
<br><br>"At the same time, this small world is not only able to escape the great breakup, but also able to circumvent the laws of the Immortal River Continent, such as ......"
<br><br>"The previous immortal path is broken!"
<br><br>Night can solemnly said.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Night Yi frowned.
<br><br>Circumventing the Immortal River Continent's Immortal Road Break, what does this mean?
<br><br>It meant that before the Immortal Road was broken, the ceiling of the Immortal River Continent was nothing more than the Ten Life Martial Emperors.
<br><br>This Lingxu Realm, on the other hand, did not have this limit.
<br><br>In other words, the battle power of the Lingxu Realm was not comparable to that of the Immortal River Continent at all.
<br><br>What's more, they are a civilization that continues from previous eras, with several eras of heritage.
<br><br>How can the Immortal River Continent, a civilization that has only passed 20 million years after the last era, be comparable?
<br><br>It can be said that it is very different.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>The appearance of the Lingxu Realm will overturn the existing power of the Immortal River Continent.
<br><br>"However, you do not need to be too nervous, after all, we have Mr. behind us."
<br><br>Night Energy softly comforted, "And as early as when Mister appeared, I had a hunch that something big might happen in the North Sea."
<br><br>"Because an existence like Mister should not have appeared in a place like the North Sea of the Immortal River Continent, so his appearance in the first place would have been somewhat representative."
<br><br>"That's also true."
<br><br>Thinking of that white-robed figure, a sense of security could not help but rise up in Nighty's heart.
<br><br>"I'm afraid that sir has long known that the Lingxu Realm will reappear in the world, and I'm afraid that the purpose of his coming to the North Sea is also closely related to the Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>Night Energy nodded solemnly.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>The entire North Sea, whether it was the many cultivators in the North Sea, or the peddlers in the mortal cities, were all talking about this vision in the sky.
<br><br>Whether or not they knew about the Lingxu Realm, the crowd felt a sense of the coming storm.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>There were also countless pairs of eyes staring in the dark ......
<br><br>Just then, a flying boat flew out of the black hole and crossed the sky of the Northern Sea Continent with the speed of a floating light.
<br><br>Ordinary people look at it, only thought it was a meteor passing by.
<br><br>But a little eye cultivator found that the flying boat alone, is the immortal weapon grade.
<br><br>Above the flying boat.
<br><br>Sitting on a cold-faced woman, her skin white, wearing a long white dress, like the snow lotus under the sky mountain.
<br><br>And behind her, there stood two white-robed old men.
<br><br>"The people here are pathetically weak, but there are parts of them that are not found in the Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>"Pass the voice down and tell the above Six Destiny Martial Emperors to come over here."
<br><br>A frothy voice came from the white-robed woman, then closed her eyes.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>One of the old men nodded slowly, his gaze moved, and opened his mouth to murmur.
<br><br>Also at the same time.
<br><br>All the experts above the Sixth Life Martial Emperor in the entire Northern Sea received a transmission in their minds.
<br><br>"Lingxu Realm Bai Yang True Palace Goddess Bai Shanyi, about all of you on the flying boat a renewal."
<br><br>"Father, what should we do?"
<br><br>Baier City, night Yi looked at the distant air flying boat, asked.
<br><br>"No harm, go and see first."
<br><br>Night can gaze slightly moved, father and daughter two towards the flying boat to step into the air.
<br><br>And in the night can father and daughter two past, the entire North Sea continent, countless open and secret experts, also have rushed towards the flying boat.
<br><br>"Let's go and see too!"
<br><br>Qingniu clan, Jian Hengtian four people looked at each other, also flew towards the flying boat.
<br><br>In a flash.
<br><br>The flying boat was filled with experts from all directions of the North Sea Continent.
<br><br>Everyone without exception revealed a grave look, a serious look at the woman in front of them.
<br><br>That woman just sitting there, it brings a heavy sense of oppression to the crowd, no one in the field can see through her cultivation.
<br><br>After a long wait, Bai Shanyi slowly opened his eyes, beautiful eyes toward the side of a light glance.
<br><br>"Since you received the transmission and still come so slowly, there is no need to come again."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>Her jade hand waved slightly.
<br><br>Then, she saw that several Martial Emperors who were still rushing towards this side in the distant air, exploded out of thin air and disappeared into a rain of blood.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Seeing this scene, the North Sea experts stirred.
<br><br>Because among those dead Martial Emperors, there was still an Eight Life Martial Emperor!
<br><br>This woman in white just waved her hand here, and that Eight Life Martial Emperor directly burst into flames and died.
<br><br>This hand is really shocking.
<br><br>"You called us here, what do you want?" At this moment, a Northern Sea Martial Emperor couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"To announce one thing."
<br><br>"My Bai Yang True Palace has decided to incorporate this part of the North Sea into my True Palace's affiliated land, and everyone will be under the control of my Bai Yang True Palace in the future."
<br><br>Bai Shao Yi said plainly.
<br><br>It was as if, talking about an extremely insignificant matter.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>There was another commotion from the crowd.
<br><br>There were angry looks on their faces.
<br><br>They were usually as the top experts and top powers of the North Sea, and suddenly such a Bai Yang True Palace ran out to treat them as slaves, how could this be tolerated?
<br><br>"I don't agree."
<br><br>One of the Sixth Life Martial Emperors stepped out and said with a cold face, "Who are you people, and why do you want us to come under your jurisdiction as soon as you come?"
<br><br>"I'm not discussing with you." Bai Shangyi glanced at him and said, "I am ordering you!"
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>This Sixth Life Martial Emperor hated his teeth, but due to the woman's strength, he didn't dare to lash out, so he could only say forcefully, "Anyway, no matter what, my Cloud Floating Sect, there is no way I will submit."
<br><br>"Very well."
<br><br>"Rather surprising to me."
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>"Very irrational."
<br><br>White shallow one slowly get up, Qian Qian body walk to the side of the flying boat, looking at the far side if thoughtful.
<br><br>"There, that is the Cloud Floating Sect, right?"
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>That Six Destiny Martial Emperor's face changed and he drank: "What do you want?"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>As soon as his voice fell, Bai Shao Yi's jade hand slowly pressed downward.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A huge boom sound spread throughout the North Sea, raising sky-high dust.
<br><br>The crowd saw that the Yunfu Sect, which was surrounded by clouds and fog and buildings towering in the distance, instantly became flat.
<br><br>The entire cloud floating clan.
<br><br>To stop the obliteration!
<br><br>"No!"
<br><br>"No!"
<br><br>"I'll fight with you."
<br><br>That Six Destiny Martial Emperor, with blood tears in his eyes, broke down and spoke out, staring at Bai Shanyi with a deadly stare, his body cultivation exploded and attacked towards Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>Bai Shanyi inclined his head and looked at him.
<br><br>The jade finger moved faintly.
<br><br>The six life martial emperor directly burst in front of the crowd, sprinkling a rain of blood sprinkled the crowd a face.
<br><br>This instant.
<br><br>Everyone in the room was enveloped in fear.
<br><br>Cloud Floating Sect is one of the largest sects other than the four clans, but let this woman in white wipe out with a wave of her hand.
<br><br>This kind of tactics.
<br><br>It was really too iron-blooded.
<br><br>"I am willing to submit."
<br><br>"I am also willing to submit."
<br><br>"Greetings to the Goddess."
<br><br>Immediately, the crowd in the field knelt down towards Bai Shanyi.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>In front of absolute strength, all dignity and unwillingness were vain.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>However, there were two people who did not kneel down and worship.
<br><br>It was the night can and night Yi father and daughter two.
<br><br>Standing, they stood out in the crowd of kneeling worshipers, immediately attracting Bai Shanyi's gaze.
<br><br>"You guys, are you not afraid of death?"
<br><br>Bai Shallow One's gaze came cheaply, and an icy cold voice came out.
