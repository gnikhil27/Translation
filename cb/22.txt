<br>"Sure enough, it's a nice looking piece of art."
<br><br>After some poking around, Yi Feng didn't find anything too substantial about this thing.
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>Easy Feng looked down at the fallen leaves on the ground, and it turned out that unknowingly summer had passed and it was already stepping into autumn.
<br><br>The autumn of this world is not like the autumn of the previous world, the autumn here is already very cold, in the winter is even more, everywhere snow-capped.
<br><br>For cultivators, this kind of weather does not affect them much.
<br><br>But for him, a mortal, it was enough to make him freeze like a dog.
<br><br>And this bead ......
<br><br>"You can use it as a furnace for me when it cools down in a few days haha, it's clean and hygienic and saves time."
<br><br>"The most critical thing is to save money on charcoal fire."
<br><br>Convinced by his own ingenuity, Yi Feng stretched, got up and walked to the front hall, and found Zhong Qing sitting on the threshold dazed. 首发 domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Easy Feng looked up slightly and found that the object of Zhong Qing's attention turned out to be the cultivators who swept by from time to time in the distance.
<br><br>"It seems that this child, still has a heart of cultivation!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed slightly.
<br><br>At the sound of his voice, Zhong Qing hurriedly got up and shouted respectfully, "Greetings, Master."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand.
<br><br>With his hands on his head, he approached Zhong Qing, looked up at the distant sky, and sighed, "I know, you are hiding something in your heart."
<br><br>Zhong Qing was slightly startled.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and just told him to sit down on the stool.
<br><br>Although the leaves fall in autumn, it is also a fruitful season. The streets in front of the door are still crowded with people, and the two men, master and disciple, sit in silence at the entrance of the martial arts school, relatively speechless.
<br><br>"Maybe, you don't really want to talk to me ......" finally, the voice came out of Yi Feng's mouth.
<br><br>Zhong Qing inclined his gaze over.
<br><br>"But no matter what, my master is not stopping you. The hall of Qingshan Gate absorbs fresh blood every ten days, so if you want, go and try your luck every ten days!" Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Zhong Qing clenched his teeth crown and was silent.
<br><br>Yi Feng also did not say anything again, and watched the street incessantly less people, then he got up.
<br><br>"It's time to cook."
<br><br>He said.
<br><br>"Master."
<br><br>Suddenly, Zhong Qing called out to him.
<br><br>Easy Feng slowly inclined his head and looked at the young boy whose face was dry and stirred by the autumn wind.
<br><br>"I have a grudge."
<br><br>"I have a blood feud!"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's eyes were red, tears were beating in his eyes, and he gritted his teeth and said towards Yi Feng, as if saying it would bring up very bad memories for him, so it seemed to take courage to say it.
<br><br>Yi Feng was silent.
<br><br>"The enemy is very strong, so strong that I can't breathe." Zhong Qing clutched the knife that Yi Feng gave him with a deadly grip and said tremblingly, "As strong as the eldest patriarch of the Qingshan Sect, or even the old ancestor!"
<br><br>Yi Feng's palm also subconsciously tightened.
<br><br>"I can only step into the cultivation path to perhaps have a glimmer of opportunity ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing looked at him with red eyes and said.
<br><br>There was a long, long silence before Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>Turn around.
<br><br>Also red-eyed.
<br><br>The heart is a little astringent, also hate, more indignant!
<br><br>The world is difficult, and Zhong Qing has to bear so much at a young age; he hates that he can't do anything about it, and he is only a mortal; he is even more angry that the Heaven is unfair, and Zhong Qing himself has no cultivation qualification.
<br><br>Cultivation of sects.
<br><br>After all, it is too far away!
<br><br>The kind of figures like the eldest patriarch of the Castle Peak Sect are already beyond the reach of mortals, and as for the ancestors of the Castle Peak Sect, mortals only hear rumors but never see them ......
<br><br>The next day.
<br><br>The Castle Peak Gate Castle Peak Grand Hall.
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qingshan sits at the top, his face excited with a little embarrassment.
<br><br>Since he borrowed the sword yesterday, he has been practicing hard for a day in seclusion, and this supreme divine sword did not disappoint him, directly raising his battle power by one level.
<br><br>But also because the martial intent in it was too profound to be fully flexible, during the hard practice, he accidentally split the Third Elder's palace and almost caused the Third Elder's most beloved disciple, Yu Wujie, to die in one go.
<br><br>"Cough cough, cough, cough, hold the sword for the first time, you guys don't mind too much."
<br><br>After a long, long time, the old ancestor of Qingshan looked at the two disciples with blue faces and said softly in a comforting voice.
<br><br>"It is a great honor for my family to receive the sword, it is just a small accident, not worth mentioning." <br><br>The third elder's heart was racing with 10,000 cao nima.
<br><br>His palace, not to mention the building, usually uses the convenience of the elders to raid the finances are countless.
<br><br>This chopper down, all fucking ruined.
<br><br>It is simply heart and liver pain!
<br><br>The company's main focus is on the development of a new product that will be used in the future.
<br><br>What's more humiliating is that when he was pulled out of the rubble, his pants were shattered under the strong knife Qi.
<br><br>Making him the butt of jokes in the Castle Peak Sect now, everywhere people talk about how ...... good he is.
