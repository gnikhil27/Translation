At least, there must be a normal person, right?
<br><br>Su Yunyun pressed on and ignored Bones Ben Wei, turned around and walked into the room and sat down on a plate.
<br><br>"Brother's road to love has not yet begun, and then ended."
<br><br>The dog sat on the shoulders of the milk agent, lying the dog's head on the fence, looking at the scene happening in the courtyard, could not help but lament.
<br><br>"Heaven is jealous of the talent, for sure!"
<br><br>The centipede snaps at the side.
<br><br>"Yes, God is jealous of the talents!"
<br><br>The dog also can't help but sigh, "But we as younger brothers, still need to help big brother more to relieve his worries ah!"
<br><br>"Yes, to find a way to find a woman for big brother ......"
<br><br>The room.
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun's face was full of darkness, and his heart was filled with irritation. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>I wanted to meditate and calm my mind and quietly wait for the time of the first turn of Nirvana to pass, but I was tormented by that black-robed dwarf who was so annoyed.
<br><br>From time to time, the window is bubbling at the mouth.
<br><br>From time to time, he poses in the courtyard again.
<br><br>Now and then humming outside again ......
<br><br>I really can't understand how Yi Feng got her such an oddball.
<br><br>She originally thought that ignoring this shorty, this shorty made a fool of himself and stopped, but she completely underestimated the resilience of this shorty.
<br><br>One day he brought her a petunia flower.
<br><br>Tomorrow, he brought her a cup of hot water, the name of the warm man's care.
<br><br>The most annoying thing is that the shorty also took advantage of the moonlight and stood on the fence reciting a limerick that he didn't know where he heard from.
<br><br>Once it was dark.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>The shorty climbed the fence again, eyes glancing at her room from time to time while reciting a serious limerick.
<br><br>"Love is like poop, you can't stop it when it comes!"
<br><br>"Love is like poop, the water flushes and never comes back ......"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun Yun felt like her head was going to explode, finally rushed out from the room and drank: "Are you annoyed, say, in the end, what do you want to be able to leave?"
<br><br>"Guliang, you are so weak, without my protection is not possible." Skeleton Benway said seriously.
<br><br>"I'm weak?"
<br><br>Su Yun Yun directly angry laugh, she tang immortal emperor reincarnation, although now the strength is not restored, but the second turn immediately after the breakthrough of the martial emperor.
<br><br>This kind of realm was indeed nothing in her previous life.
<br><br>But in the Immortal River Continent, it was also the top top battle power, but in the mouth of this dwarf became weak?
<br><br>"Do you know about Martial Emperors?" She asked in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor?"
<br><br>"What the hell is that?"
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei shook his head.
<br><br>Su Yunyun was completely choked speechless.
<br><br>The Martial Emperor had never been exposed to it, but he had always heard of it, but it turned out that this dwarf didn't even know what a Martial Emperor was, how ignorant must he be!
<br><br>"Forget it, I don't have the heart to fight with you, I'll just tell you one thing, I don't need your protection, if there's really any danger, it's not something that you, a guy who doesn't seem to have the slightest strength, can protect." Su Yunyun said with an icy face.
<br><br>"Woman, you so look down on this scum, but will regret it!" Bone Ben Wei said with special anger.
<br><br>"Regret?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun's face was full of speechlessness.
<br><br>What could she regret?
<br><br>She was eager for this shorty to leave.
<br><br>"Okay, it seems that you, a woman, do not deserve my love, then this shorty will leave, but remind you, if you really come across anything, hide inside the martial arts school and do not come out."
<br><br>"Bye."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei left in anger, taking a few of the dogs with him, and reappointed the little lady from the other day.
<br><br>Seeing Bone Ben Wei leave.
<br><br>Su Yunyun suddenly felt that the world was clear.
<br><br>Whew!
<br><br>She stood at the door and exhaled a foul breath, just as she was about to turn around and enter the martial arts school, a sudden fluctuation came from the darkness behind her.
<br><br>Three figures, directly from the void, walked out.
<br><br>"Immortal Emperor Yun Yun, you're really not dead, long time no see!"
<br><br>Three people emitted ice-cold voices, looking at Su Yun Yun with a smiling expression.
<br><br>Hearing the voices, Su Yun Yun Yun's hair and bones creeped out as she fiercely turned to look at the three people behind her, and suddenly her face was grave.
<br><br>"You guys."
<br><br>"Is it Chen Yizhen's people?"
<br><br>Su Yunyun asked with a face full of gravity as she stepped back slightly on her paws.
<br><br>"Not bad, exactly!" The three people sneered.
<br><br>Receiving confirmation, Su Yun Yun Yun's brow furrowed even tighter.
<br><br>She never expected that Chen Yi Zhen, the one who had framed her to death, actually knew that she was not dead, and even sent people to chase her here, wanting to chase her to death.
<br><br>"We are here today to relieve Immortal Emperor Yi Zhen's worries and eliminate future problems!"
<br><br>The three of them looked icy cold as they forced themselves towards Su Yunyun step by step.
<br><br>"Hmph, Chen Yi Zhen personally appearing in front of me would indeed make me scare, but with just the three of you trash, do you really think you can deal with me?" Seeing the three people forcing their way, Su Yun Yun Yun said in a deep voice.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>One of the old men laughed out loud.
<br><br>"Su Yunyun, Su Yunyun, if it was you in the past, you could indeed crush us with just one finger, but now?"
<br><br>"Really think you're still the old you, when we don't know anything."
<br><br>The old man's words.
<br><br>It instantly made Su Yunyun's face sink.
<br><br>She had wanted to swindle these three so that she could buy herself some time to think of a way to deal with them, but she never expected to be punctured by this man's words.
<br><br>"Don't make a pointless struggle, just tie your hands and capture them."
<br><br>The three people looked ice-cold, in a semi-encircling direction, and forced towards Su Yunyun.
<br><br>In the next instant.
<br><br>The three of them made their moves at the same time, and their powerful attacks came towards Su Yunyun in a tricky manner.
<br><br>Su Yunyun's face changed greatly.
<br><br>Wanted to step back, but behind herself was the martial arts school.
<br><br>If she entered the martial hall and was blocked, with her current state of Nirvana, she would undoubtedly be running into a dead end.
<br><br>As for Bones Ben Wei's advance before he left, she completely ignored it.
<br><br>These three in front of her, at least, were Heavenly Immortals.
<br><br>She didn't think that this one mortal's broken martial school could still help her block the Heavenly Immortals.
<br><br>The good thing is.
<br><br>She was reborn, and not completely unprepared.
<br><br>The palm of her hand quickly took out a scroll and unfolded it with it.
<br><br>In a flash, Su Yunyun disappeared in place and teleported outside of Pingjiang City.
<br><br>The three people pounced on the empty space.
<br><br>"Hmph, I had expected that you might have this tactic, good thing we weren't unprepared."
<br><br>The old man smiled icily and took out a compass.
<br><br>The compass flickered and faintly trembled, then pointed to one side.
<br><br>"Not much farther, chase!"
<br><br>The three of them turned into three streams of light and immediately chased out towards the outside of Pingjiang City.
