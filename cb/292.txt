It seems that he saw through what he was up to long ago and just didn't care to make a move on a character like her before letting her off the hook!
<br><br>"Many thanks."
<br><br>Shui Xing said gratefully and quickly disappeared in the fog.
<br><br>And soon after Shui Xing walked, the fog also quickly dissipated.
<br><br>And Yi Feng followed Desolate Pathless also finally crossed the mountain range as he wished and arrived at the city.
<br><br>The name is Shanshui City.
<br><br>This Shanshui City is really true to its name, to this point Yi Feng counted know what is called beauty.
<br><br>Here, there are no flat streets and roads, all the buildings, are located on the rugged mountain peaks, cliff sides, before the waterfall.
<br><br>And these buildings are also designed in a ghostly way, completely integrated with the landscape.
<br><br>"Seconds and seconds!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but lament that this place was simply a perfect combination of nature's devilish workmanship and human power. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"Haha, it's good that the former ...... old brother likes it."
<br><br>Desolate WuJi laughed loudly, but after knowing Yi Feng's true identity, to continue to call Yi Feng like this, really consumed a lot of his courage.
<br><br>Shortly after, Desolate Wujing brought Yi Feng to a small courtyard.
<br><br>The courtyard.
<br><br>There were waterfalls and pavilions.
<br><br>"Haha old brother, is there any wine?"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but ask as he sat down on a stone bench.
<br><br>"There's wine, there's wine, let you have a good time today." Desolate Wujing hurriedly called people to send a variety of wine, but also called a group of young ladies to accompany the dance for fun.
<br><br>After drinking a cup with Desolation Trail, looking at the lost Bone Ben Wei sitting on the side, Yi Feng's gaze slightly moved.
<br><br>The heart is quite a bit intolerant.
<br><br>There is also some guilt that he just hit a little harder.
<br><br>After all, although this thing does not let him save his mind, but accompanied him for so long, Yi Feng heart has long treated him as one of their own.
<br><br>"Just now did not break you where, right?" Yi Feng pulled Bone Ben Wei aside and touched his bones up and down through his black robe, while asking.
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei shook his head.
<br><br>But the appearance, but full of aggression.
<br><br>"Rarely come to such a good place, you go to have a little fun yourself!" Yi Feng took out a money bag, counted it, and handed it over to Bone Ben Wei with a meaty face.
<br><br>"Get lost!"
<br><br>Seeing this, Bone Ben Wei's body shook and became energetic, and his hands hurriedly took the money bag.
<br><br>Watching this scene, Desolate Pathless's eyes moved darkly.
<br><br>This black-robed man, despite being aggrieved in front of Yi Feng, was an existence that he didn't dare to offend easily to him.
<br><br>"Yun Lang, hurry up and take this, this brother around for a stroll." Desolate Wu Dao hastily instructed.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Yun Lang hurriedly nodded, nowadays he also did not dare to take it lightly in the slightest, also long ago understood his previous short-sightedness.
<br><br>At this moment, Bone Ben Wei that happy, urgently greeted the dog, and walked out of the courtyard with Yun Lang.
<br><br>"Haha, trouble old brother, it's just us two brothers left, let's drink to our heart's content." Yi Feng raised his glass of wine and laughed.
<br><br>"Good, good, let's drink to our heart's content."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing similarly raised his cup.
<br><br>"Desolate Wujing, so you really came back."
<br><br>Just as the two were drinking to their heart's content, a voice came from outside the courtyard door.
<br><br>Seeing this, Desolate Wu Jie's face changed slightly and he hurriedly put down his wine cup and said, "Old ...... brother, I'll go for a moment and come back immediately."
<br><br>"Be my guest, old brother."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled and said.
<br><br>Receiving Yi Feng's permission, Desolate Pathless hurriedly walked out.
<br><br>Outside the courtyard door, a long-skirted beautiful woman and a gray-robed old man were standing there.
<br><br>"What are you two shouting about?"
<br><br>Desolate Wu Jie drank without good grace, "Say, what do you want from the old man, if nothing, hurry up and leave, I have things to do and don't have time for you."
<br><br>"Yo, Desolate Wujing, you have a high tone nowadays, you're actually so impatient with us, who are you drinking with that you're drinking yourself so high?" The long-skirted beauty twitched her nose and asked rather mockingly.
<br><br>"What do you care about me, hurry up and go go go."
<br><br>Desolate Wujing said with a stern face and waved his palm impatiently.
<br><br>"Hmph, Desolate Wujing, we came to see you to discuss these few heartbreaking problems of the five elements, this is a matter of business." Long-skirted beauty woman said solemnly.
<br><br>"Then also give me go, nothing business is more important than what I am doing now." Desolate Pathless continued to give the order of expulsion and said.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Then in that case, then I just want to see which such an important person you are drinking with, and actually do not even have such a serious matter as the five elements in mind."
<br><br>The long-skirted beautiful woman was quite angry, and the aura of investigation suddenly diffused silently towards the courtyard.
<br><br>Then suddenly sneered out.
<br><br>"Desolate pathless you can ah, I thought what kind of person makes you so impatient with us, it turns out to be a mortal ah!?"
