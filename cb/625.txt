After Yi Feng promulgated this decision.
<br><br>Yi Feng promulgated two more decisions one after another.
<br><br>The first.
<br><br>Starting today, everyone in the martial arts school, as long as they are under him, can follow him out every first day of the month.
<br><br>The second.
<br><br>That is, people who go out, unless special circumstances, can not come back in.
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng also thought, can go out, but also all vowed to submit to him, then continue to stay here for what?
<br><br>This is not for no reason to increase his expenses and burden?
<br><br>So it is better to let them go out and develop themselves, the future development of good, the immortal world everywhere, then he Yi Feng is not the plum full of the world?
<br><br>Simply beautiful.
<br><br>"Okay, I'll be ready to go out later, is there anyone who wants to go out with me this time?" Yi Feng asked. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The field is silent, no one is to go out, more clutching the hoe in his hand dead not let go, afraid to ask him to go.
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng instantly confused.
<br><br>What.
<br><br>This group of people off stupid?
<br><br>This has the opportunity to go out, not go out?
<br><br>"Forget it, let it be."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand, and did not care about them, it just so happens that if he is ready to grow and expand here, he also needs to expand.
<br><br>Since we want to expand, we also need manpower.
<br><br>"Since you are not going, then you guys plant!"
<br><br>Yi Feng took out several sacks of seeds, which he had just exchanged from the system.
<br><br>After all, the Qi luck points of the Immortal River Continent would hit his card on time every month, so it was easy to exchange some seeds.
<br><br>"Give me good care of it, by the way, I'll give you a goal, I want the vegetation rate of Shadow Island, to reach more than ninety percent."
<br><br>Yi Feng commanded.
<br><br>The crowd at the bottom marveled.
<br><br>This goal.
<br><br>It was worthy of Mr.
<br><br>Shadow Island, such a hairless place, actually vegetation rate to reach ninety percent?
<br><br>This kind of horrible stroke.
<br><br>Simply terrifying.
<br><br>The most critical thing is, these vegetation is not ordinary vegetation ah!
<br><br>"Know what I mean?"
<br><br>Seeing that no one answered, Yi Feng increased his voice and asked.
<br><br>"Understand!"
<br><br>The crowd answered in unison.
<br><br>Knowing that Mr. this is to use Shadow Island as the foundation, to create a super immortal realm that surpasses the Heaven's Immortal Palace.
<br><br>"Old Gong, you come out with me!"
<br><br>Yi Feng sat on his butt on Slowly's back and squirmed as soon as his feet glared.
<br><br>Old Gong followed behind.
<br><br>Even more behind, a frog followed and croaked.
<br><br>A few moments later.
<br><br>Yi Feng led Gong Chen to inside a city not far from the Sun Moon Sect.
<br><br>The first step.
<br><br>He is ready to buy a house here.
<br><br>After all, there must be a place to live outside, or slowly looking for disciples at the same time, to figure out their own cultivation status.
<br><br>Originally this side of the house price is not cheap, with Yi Feng just came to the immortal world not long ago, it is impossible to have so much money.
<br><br>But the money left behind after the death of the Sun Moon Peak group of disciples were all scavenged into Yi Feng's hands.
<br><br>Several storage rings full of immortal crystals, how must also be able to buy a good house, the rest, perhaps also can recruit two maids with the side to give him a pinch legs, pounding shoulders.
<br><br>Life is not too good.
<br><br>"Old Gong ah, you go contact!"
<br><br>Yi Feng picked out a piece of feng shui treasure land.
<br><br>Gong Chen errands no words, soon contacted the city lord's office, ready to pay the money with one hand and call the deed with the other.
<br><br>But damn to pay the money, Yi Feng directly vomited blood.
<br><br>"Sorry this lord, now the currency of the immortal world has indeed changed, this is the notice issued by the Heaven's Immortal Palace two days ago, unified only recognize gold coins, who does not comply, the Heaven's Immortal Palace will descend punishment."
<br><br>"You also know, in the immortal world, the Heaven's Immortal Palace words no one dares not good, so this is also no way things, in short, immortal crystals, now collect rags no one use!" That is responsible for selling the house boy explained.
<br><br>"Kam ah!"
<br><br>"That murderous grandson did it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng blackened his face and roared directly in the same place, his face became twisted.
<br><br>Think about the beginning.
<br><br>He swore to come to the Immortal World with many sacks of gold coins, ready to live a good life, but learned that in the Immortal World gold coins were useless at all, and only recognized Immortal Crystals.
<br><br>This fact, Yi Feng took many days to accept.
<br><br>And very painful, very reluctant to throw the sacks of gold coins to the cesspit.
<br><br>Now it is easy for him to save ah save, and get several storage rings of immortal crystals, thought he was rich again.
<br><br>But who knows.
<br><br>The common currency of the immortal world has turned into gold coins?
<br><br>"Damn you, are you playing with me?"
<br><br>"Which grandson did this in the end?"
<br><br>"I curse you to be single for 10,000 years and never find a woman for the rest of your life!"
<br><br>Yi Feng completely disregarded his image and cursed.
<br><br>A hundred thousand miles away.
<br><br>Countless around the skeleton Ben Wei's girls, suddenly appeared all kinds of things, some to break through the departure, some of the family died away, in short, a variety of reasons various.
<br><br>Less than a few moments, the box only a few dogs left.
<br><br>Empty.
<br><br>At the same time, skeleton Ben Wei directly sneezed, and then sat on his butt on the ground.
<br><br>"It's over."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei secretly exclaimed.
<br><br>The tube does not care about the dog next to him, rushing up to the sky.
<br><br>"Brother eh, what happened to you?"
<br><br>The dog shouted.
<br><br>"I was cursed, have to ask that kid from Heavenly Way to change the currency back in order to break ......"
<br><br>"Your brother, I don't want to be unable to find a woman for the rest of my life ......"
<br><br>And here in Yi Feng.
<br><br>See Yi Feng so scolded, that the boy trembled with fear, and quickly reminded, "the adult cautious words, cautious words ah!"
<br><br>"I am careful to say you paralyzed."
<br><br>Yi Feng was furious.
<br><br>Gong Chen on the side looked straight shiver.
<br><br>Sir is really sir.
<br><br>Which of the other senior people are not end to end pretending.
<br><br>Only Mr. true nature.
<br><br>Also love money.
<br><br>Can really grounded.
<br><br>Good thing, Gong Chen there are still some gold coins, although also do not know what he used before, but at least solve the urgent needs of Yi Feng.
<br><br>Finally a house was bought.
<br><br>After settling down, Yi Feng began to think about his cultivation situation.
<br><br>Still can't think all the time.
<br><br>Desperately want to find someone to spit.
<br><br>After glancing at Old Gong who was respectfully at the side, he pondered slightly and then asked, "Old Gong, do you know what cultivation level I am?"
<br><br>"That, my subordinate does not know."
<br><br>Gong Chen respectfully replied.
<br><br>"Ugh."
<br><br>"To be honest, I don't know what cultivation level I am either." Yi Feng rubbed his forehead, worried.
<br><br>Gong Chen was shocked.
<br><br>Sir's cultivation level.
<br><br>Was it already so high that he didn't even know the realm himself?
<br><br>In other words, breaking through the barrier of the immortal realm and reaching the point where no one has developed it?
<br><br>"Harm."
<br><br>"I don't know if you can understand me, but in any case this feeling."
<br><br>"So annoying!"
<br><br>Yi Feng was full of depression.
<br><br>"Annoying?"
<br><br>Gong Chen's face twitched.
<br><br>Good.
<br><br>So damned Versailles!
<br><br>The heart is even a big surprise: I also want to have such a trouble ah!
