"What?"
<br><br>"Yi Feng?"
<br><br>The moment these words fell.
<br><br>It could be said that a stone had set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>It set off a big wave in the scene.
<br><br>Whether it was Guo Shijie or Liu Yan, each and every one of them showed an unbelievable look.
<br><br>"Patriarch, is there a mistake!"
<br><br>"The strength this kid showed before was only an Earth Immortal, how did he manage to kill so many of my Sun Moon Peak disciples?" Guo Shijie shouted incredulously.
<br><br>"Yes Sovereign, could there be a mistake?"
<br><br>Liu Yan also spoke out anxiously.
<br><br>Although the death of the Sun Moon Peak disciples made her feel relieved from the bottom of her heart, if it was really Yi Feng's doing, then I'm afraid no one would be able to protect Yi Feng. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This matter, is really too big.
<br><br>"This is the result that the elders and I came up with together, there will be no mistake!" Sima Zhen said in a deep voice.
<br><br>As soon as Sima Zhen confirmed, Liu Yan's face turned white and he immediately took two steps back.
<br><br>Guo Shijie, on the other hand, shouted loudly.
<br><br>"Good boy."
<br><br>"Hiding really deep!"
<br><br>He tugged his fist deadly tight, gritting his teeth, and a strong killing intent flowed in his eyes.
<br><br>But he profoundly understood that Sima Zhen was here, and it was not his turn to be executed, so he knelt on the ground and said, "Please also ask the Sovereign to execute this poisonous son and give us an explanation for Sun Moon Peak!"
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The other Sun Moon Peak disciples also followed suit and knelt on the ground at once.
<br><br>"Please execute this poisonous son and give an explanation to Sun Moon Peak!"
<br><br>"Please execute this poisonous son and give an explanation to Sun Moon Peak!"
<br><br>The voices shook the sky for a moment.
<br><br>And seeing this, Liu Yan also knelt down, followed by the rest of Star Peak.
<br><br>"Sovereign, even if it was done by Yi Feng, there is a hidden agenda, please find out." Liu Yan said anxiously.
<br><br>"Hmph, Liu Yan you stinking bitch, shut up, what hidden agenda can there be, even if there is a heavenly hidden agenda, it is not an excuse for him to massacre my Sun Moon Peak disciples!" Guo Shijie shouted.
<br><br>"Guo Shijie, you'd better keep your mouth shut, what if you Sun Moon Peak surrounded him and forced him to do it?" Liu Yan said in a tit-for-tat manner.
<br><br>"Shut up."
<br><br>Seeing that the two were getting more and more quarrelsome, Sima Zhen let out a heavy shout.
<br><br>Under Sima Zhen's scolding, the scene was silent.
<br><br>Then, Sima Zhen said in a deep voice: "This matter may have a hidden agenda, but after all, thousands of lives are at stake, I will find out, and those who should be dealt with will be dealt with, you do not need to say anything."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Liu Yan instantly changed color.
<br><br>Guo Shijie, on the other hand, laughed out coldly and hurriedly kowtowed: "Thank you, Sovereign."
<br><br>"Alright, the Grand Competition is terminated, open the Grand Competition barrier and let them out!"
<br><br>Sikong Zhen said with a lift of his palm.
<br><br>At these words, the elders behind him raised their heads and started the formation at the same time.
<br><br>A spatial door appeared across the sky, connecting the back mountain.
<br><br>The site of the Grand Competition.
<br><br>Yi Feng coldly glanced at the many Star Peak disciples behind him who didn't dare to breathe, and laughed in his heart.
<br><br>Think of yourself just now.
<br><br>What a fucking pretender!
<br><br>But he is at least a horizontal expert in the immortal world, can not show the end in front of them.
<br><br>High hand.
<br><br>You have to have the style of a master.
<br><br>Have to end.
<br><br>Looked up.
<br><br>"Ahem, the barrier is open, go out!"
<br><br>He faintly spoke out.
<br><br>Yang Yi and the others heard the words and hastily responded respectfully, then collectively walked towards the exit.
<br><br>As the teleportation doors connected, one by one, the disciples began to walk out of the teleportation doors and arrived at the martial arts arena in an orderly manner.
<br><br>"Peak Master, we have so many dead disciples, is it really enough to kill one Yi Feng?" Bai Jing asked in a small voice as he was beside Guo Shijie.
<br><br>"Humph, what do you know?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie said in a deep voice: "This is such a big deal, do you really think the patriarch will let it go? I can say that today that little bastard Yi Feng will not only die, Star Peak will certainly not escape the blame."
<br><br>"Although this is so, but our loss is still significant ah!" Bai Jing said.
<br><br>"So what?" Guo Shijie said in a deep voice: "Although many people died, but they are just a group of bottom-level disciples, our Sun Moon Peak's real three elites, but they are still there."
<br><br>"Peak Master, what do you mean?" Bai Jing's eyes lit up and said, "You are talking about the three from the Heavenly Mansion Kingdom?"
<br><br>"Good, as long as they are safe and sound, the others will die, disciples of this level can be received casually in the Immortal Realm, on the contrary, being able to use their deaths in exchange for the Sovereign's suppression of Star Peak is absolutely worth it." Guo Shijie said in a deep voice.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Bai Jing's eyes lit up and couldn't help but give a thumbs up, "Master, you are so smart!"
<br><br>"Hmph, learn it well!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie, stroked his beard, a cold smile on his face, while his eyes subconsciously looked at the exit, waiting for Yi Feng to come out.
<br><br>But the next moment, his palm shook.
<br><br>Almost pulled the beard off.
<br><br>"What's wrong with the master?"
<br><br>Bai Jing asked.
<br><br>While asking the question, he followed Guo Shijie's gaze.
<br><br>"Quack!"
<br><br>A dry duck-like cry came out from his throat.
<br><br>It was because they were seeing that Yi Feng had walked out from the teleportation formation, and along with Yi Feng, there were their three proud geniuses.
<br><br>They were bowing and clustering around Yi Feng with a pandering posture.
<br><br>"Grand Master Yi, we had heard of you before the Grand Competition."
<br><br>"Yes, at that time we thought that Grand Master Yi was not an ordinary person."
<br><br>"That's right, Grand Master Yi is a genius who has succeeded in cultivating the One Thought Finger in one ye!"
<br><br>The three people desperately bragged.
<br><br>But yet they also took it very well, and did not lift out Skeleton Grand Master, after all, looking at Skeleton Grand Master's appearance of running away at that time, they surely did not want this one to know that Skeleton Grand Master had been in contact with them.
<br><br>Yi Feng face flat, continue to end, to the three people love to ignore.
<br><br>But in his heart, he was laughing.
<br><br>The big brother who rose 50 levels in a row is different!
<br><br>Although these three pussies blow him a little disgusting, but still inexplicably soothing ah!
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>Directly let Guo Shijie gas straight cramp.
<br><br>He, the three geniuses, how did he get mixed up with Yi Feng?
<br><br>"Li Tian, Li Di, Li Ren."
<br><br>He shouted in anger.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The three glanced at him and directly ignored him, continuing in clustering in front of Yi Feng, acting like they were pandering.
<br><br>"Damn, damn, what the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie covered his chest, almost did not breathe over.
<br><br>And the moment Yi Feng walked out, countless disciples of the Xuantian Sect's enforcement team surrounded towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Other eyes, too, looked at him in unison.
<br><br>"Yi Feng, who the hell are you, and what exactly is your purpose in coming to my sect?"
<br><br>Sima Zhen stepped out, his aura revealed, and asked directly to the point.
<br><br>The elders behind him also stepped out in unison, and immediately surrounded Yi Feng in the middle.
<br><br>This battle immediately caused an uproar in the whole room.
<br><br>Even the angry Guo Shijie was speechless.
<br><br>This, isn't it just Yi Feng?
<br><br>Even if he killed all the disciples of Sun Moon Peak, but the patriarch personally went out and took him down?
<br><br>But now he is making such a scene, and he wants all the elders to come together?
<br><br>"What do you mean by that?"
<br><br>Looking at this battle, Yi Feng's eyebrows also instantly frowned.
<br><br>"You don't have to pretend, just now we divined the death of Sun Moon Peak disciples, and when we divined you according to the list, you were the only one who was blank."
<br><br>"This means that your strength, at least, is the same level as mine!"
<br><br>Sima Zhen said word by word.
<br><br>As Sima Zhen's voice fell.
<br><br>The whole room was once again in an uproar.
<br><br>Guo Shijie and Liu Yan, in particular, had their mouths open wide and their expressions were filled with dumbfoundedness.
<br><br>Yi Feng.
<br><br>He was actually at the same level as the Patriarch?
<br><br>No, did you hear it right?
<br><br>This news is too shocking!
