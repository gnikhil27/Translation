But in the end.
<br><br>He also did not see a reason.
<br><br>"It's really strange."
<br><br>Desolate Wuji muttered secretly.
<br><br>Because with the strength of his guard Yun Lang, even if he hid his cultivation, there was no way that the phrase of losing his footing and falling into the water could exist.
<br><br>He originally thought that Bone Ben Wei was some kind of low-profile expert that caused this.
<br><br>But now it seems clearly impossible.
<br><br>Because no matter how he observed, this escort of Yi Feng is just an ordinary to not be able to ordinary mortal.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>There is also a possibility.
<br><br>That is, the strength of this escort Yi Feng, so powerful that he desolate pathless also can not see through. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But is this possible?
<br><br>Desolate Wujing obviously does not think so.
<br><br>The reason is that the person who can drip in front of him, at least cultivation is also much stronger than him.
<br><br>However this kind of person, Desolate Wuji does not think will appear in a place like Nansha.
<br><br>"It seems that it's all your fault." Desolate Wujing lectured in a deep voice, "I'll warn you one last time, if you do it again, go stay at the Heartless Cliff by yourself!"
<br><br>Yun Lang sweated coldly and apologized repeatedly, claiming that he would not do it again.
<br><br>Night.
<br><br>Deserted Pathless re-rented a big boat.
<br><br>On the bow of the boat.
<br><br>Four enchanting and beautifully dressed young girls were crowded next to Yi Feng and Desolate Wujing.
<br><br>In the laughter, between the flowers and wine, along the river watching the beautiful scenery along the way, simply fast.
<br><br>The corner of the cabin, skeleton Ben Wei holding the dog looking at the scene on the bow of the boat, eyes full of sorrow.
<br><br>Look at people.
<br><br>And then look at yourself ......
<br><br>What for?
<br><br>However, what makes Bones Ben Wei feel most uncomfortable is not just that, because there are many similar boats on the river.
<br><br>And it just so happens that there was a flower boat about the same size that crossed their boat lengthwise.
<br><br>And the scene that happened on the prow of the boat over there is what made Bones Ben Wei feel the most solid.
<br><br>Because on that boat, a man was surrounded by a dozen good-looking ladies, and caught hide-and-seek blindfolded.
<br><br>"Hahahaha, I caught it."
<br><br>Just when that boat is just the closest to the skeleton Ben Wei, the blindfolded man caught two young ladies at once, holding in his arms, emitting a joyful laughter.
<br><br>This scene, simply look at the skeleton Ben Wei tender.
<br><br>The most damn let him feel jealousy and hatred is that the boy on the boat is also a damn bald ass.
<br><br>"On what basis ......"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei could not help but mutter.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, your son loose a loose, I can not breathe." The dog Ao Qing rose his face and passed out his voice shouting.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Life is tasteless!"
<br><br>Seeing this, skeleton Ben Wei just let go of the dog son who subconsciously hugged tightly, heavily sighed and emitted a sad voice.
<br><br>And the opposite side of that boat scene, also by Yi Feng looked at the eyes.
<br><br>A monk, playing so high.
<br><br>It simply also made him feel speechless.
<br><br>"Old brother, I'll give you something."
<br><br>Two cups of wine down, desolate no path is more and more chat with Yi Feng, put down the wine cup from the pocket took out a jade pendant.
<br><br>"This, old brother what are you doing?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the jade pendant in Desolate Wujing's hand and asked in confusion.
<br><br>"It's nothing, I just feel like I've met you before, so I want to give you something." Desolate Wujing smiled and said lightly.
<br><br>"You, my lord?"
<br><br>However, Yun Lang's eyes widened when he saw this jade pendant, and his mouth couldn't help but shout out.
<br><br>Because other people might not know the function of this jade pendant, but he knew exactly what it was.
<br><br>This is a treasure of honorable quality!
<br><br>Wearing it on his body could automatically protect the master, and it could even withstand a blow from the strength of a martial dweller.
<br><br>Even he, Yun Lang, did not have a few such treasures on him, yet His Holiness gave it to a mortal?
<br><br>This instantly made him feel unbalanced in his heart.
<br><br>Desolate Wujian secretly glared at Yun Lang, who then dared not continue to make a sound.
<br><br>"Older brother, remember, you should always carry this jade pendant with you, in the future, you will always know my good intentions." Desolate Wuji handed the jade pendant to Yi Feng and solemnly explained.
<br><br>However, he didn't explain too much.
<br><br>Because he did not want to put too much pressure on Yi Feng, and the purpose of his move was purely out of concern for Yi Feng.
<br><br>After all, Yi Feng was only a mortal anyway, and it was inevitable that he would encounter danger in this cultivation world, and with this jade pendant, he was basically able to keep Yi Feng worry-free.
<br><br>"Older brother is also really too polite, and actually gave me a souvenir."
<br><br>Yi Feng took the jade pendant and hurriedly said thank you.
<br><br>In his heart, he said that this Desolate Pathless was too polite, and let him carry the jade pendant with him, so he seemed to be a true friend of the people!
<br><br>But he also knows the principle of courtesy and reciprocity.
<br><br>After thinking about it, he took out a small wooden carving and placed it on the table.
<br><br>"Older brother, what is this?"
<br><br>Desolate Wuji looked at the small human-shaped wooden sculpture on the table.
<br><br>"Old brother, this is the gourd boy I sculpted." Yi Feng laughed.
<br><br>"Gourd boy?"
<br><br>Desolate Wujing was filled with bewilderment.
<br><br>"Anyway, it's just a small gadget, also this is my gift to you, for the sake of our friendship, you should also carry it around with you, don't forget me oh." Yi Feng smiled and pushed the gourd doll towards Desolate Wujing.
<br><br>Desolate Wujing was stunned.
<br><br>He knew that Yi Feng had misunderstood what he meant by carrying it around with him.
<br><br>However, he did not pick it up, but laughed with Yi Feng and said, "Fine, fine, I will carry it with me too, I will definitely not forget old brother."
<br><br>With that, he put the gourd doll away.
<br><br>Of course.
<br><br>In his heart, he also only regarded this object as a souvenir.
