Not long after.
<br><br>Yi Feng finally came to Wolong City alone.
<br><br>Originally not so alone, but Wu Yonghong's family just happened to have an urgent matter inside.
<br><br>As for Skeleton Ben Wei ......
<br><br>Yi Feng thought of this one and felt a headache.
<br><br>Is Yi Feng and that zombie face playing chess that day, this guy and Yun Lang also went outside together to drink.
<br><br>But you say drinking on drinking, he that skull frame is how to drink also first not to pursue.
<br><br>But the hell is, after you drink, people throw the embroidered ball you a broken skull head to go together what hilarious?
<br><br>Got.
<br><br>And really fucking robbed.
<br><br>Once you think of the trouble, Yi Feng really do not know what to say. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>But also can not let Zhong Qing a person outside dry waiting, this is not he had to be alone first Zhong Qing received said.
<br><br>As for the matter of skeleton Ben Wei, I can only wait to go back and then slowly solve it!
<br><br>Soon after coming to Wolong City, I finally saw my little disciple who I hadn't seen for days.
<br><br>Do not say.
<br><br>This little guy changed really big, not only became the spring, even the clothing also changed a lot.
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>There are women is good ah.
<br><br>The hateful thing is that he, the master, is still a single dog.
<br><br>"Drink?"
<br><br>Looking at the restaurant next to him, thinking that it has also arrived at mealtime, Yi Feng could not help but ask towards his young apprentice.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, good."
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his head, still the same ignorant and naive look.
<br><br>The master and disciple sat down against the window, ordered two small dishes, and served a pot of good wine.
<br><br>After the master and disciple drank a glass, Zhong Qing coyly seemed to have something to say.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>He held it for a long time, and only then said with a red face, "Master, men, are they that hard?"
<br><br>"What do you mean?"
<br><br>Yi Feng frowned.
<br><br>"It's just that ......"
<br><br>Zhong Qing red face, moved the stool towards Yi Feng came together, said: "is the dream day, right, everything is good, is that is ......"
<br><br>"Look master, I've been concealed recently ......"
<br><br>"Thin?"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Zhong Qing blankly, apparently still did not understand what Zhong Qing was going to say.
<br><br>"Aiya Master you ...... how come you just don't get it?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing shook his head with an ugly look on his face and said, "Forget it, in retrospect it's understandable that you don't understand, Master."
<br><br>"What do you mean by that again?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked as he put down his glass of wine.
<br><br>"Master does not need to blame himself, although master is over, but you are only a single dog." Zhong Qing explained, "So it's only right that a single dog can't understand my suffering."
<br><br>"Hey, you little arm-child, burying your master?"
<br><br>Yi Feng felt a knife stabbed in his chest, and he was so angry that he knocked a violent chestnut towards Zhong Qing's head.
<br><br>Zhong Qing held his head in pain and asked aggressively, "Master, why did you hit me?"
<br><br>"Tell me clearly what is going on." Yi Fengwu said with a black face.
<br><br>"That's right, Meng Tian Tian is pestering me day after day, pestering me several times a day." Zhong Qing said with a red face, "This is not, I rushed all the way here, my legs and feet are weak."
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng just sort of dawned on him.
<br><br>But suddenly.
<br><br>He was a little heartbroken his little disciple.
<br><br>Motherfucker several times a day, is it a human thing to do, or is this world so fierce people?
<br><br>This makes Yi Feng just rose, is not to give Zhong Qing find a master mother's idea, immediately suppressed.
<br><br>Otherwise, he could not stand it.
<br><br>"So, this is the reason why you left so soon?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Mm."
<br><br>Zhong Qing nodded with difficulty and said with embarrassment, "So I told Meng Tian that there was something going on in Pingjiang City, so I would be separated for a while."
<br><br>"Hard work."
<br><br>Yi Feng patted his little disciple's skinny little shoulder, sighed, and softly comforted, "But don't be afraid, when we return to Pingjiang City, I'll get something to give you a good tonic, and keep it so you can spoil your masculinity."
<br><br>"Thank you, Master."
<br><br>Only then did Zhong Qing's face overflow with a strong smile.
<br><br>Just at this time in the inn.
<br><br>A woman in black came in.
<br><br>Her face is stunningly beautiful, tall, three thousand green silk draped behind the shoulders, with a faint fragrance, a pair of slender thighs on both sides, don't a circle of black cloth band, bring a different visual touch.
<br><br>Her appearance.
<br><br>Immediately let a lot of people eating in the restaurant, cast a pair of piggy eyes.
<br><br>"Sorry guest, there are no seats available for the time being."
<br><br>The store assistant hurriedly ran up and said embarrassedly.
<br><br>"This, what can be done?"
<br><br>From the mouth of the woman in black, a moving voice came out, carrying a sense of seduction since.
<br><br>"Girl, how about this side to sit?"
<br><br>"Girl, come this way come this way."
<br><br>"Girl, I'll move to the side, you can just sit down."
<br><br>"Girl, it's better this way ......"
<br><br>And the crowd of people who were concerned about the woman heard that there were no more seats, they suddenly became enthusiastic and passed out an invitation towards her.
<br><br>Smell.
<br><br>The corners of the black-clothed woman's mouth were slightly outlined.
<br><br>After a simple disguise, she also deliberately dressed up, while choosing this time period without empty seats to come, want to play exactly such an effect.
<br><br>And the effect.
<br><br>The effect is also very obvious.
<br><br>However, for these people's invitation, she does not care.
<br><br>She was waiting.
<br><br>Waiting for the pair of master and disciple by the window to extend an invitation to her.
<br><br>She didn't believe that everyone else in the restaurant had extended invitations to him, and this master and disciple pair could be surprised?
