"I just happened to be passing by and stopped by to see how your Star Peak disciples are doing with their practice."
<br><br>Guo Shijie lifted his robe and sat down on the chair in the hall with a big grin.
<br><br>"Recently, the disciples have all gone to the Immortal Technique Pavilion to pick out their immortal techniques and refine them as well. You know, some of my Sun Moon Peak's disciples have already broken through to small success."
<br><br>Said Guo Shijie, laughing out loud.
<br><br>"Xiao Cheng ah, Xiao Cheng! You should know what the concept of practicing to small success within a few days is!"
<br><br>"Speaking of which, I'm also curious about your Star Peak's most powerful disciples, are there any small successes now?"
<br><br>"Hey, it's really a bit hard to say small success." Guo Shijie said, looking at Liu Yan with a regretful face, the tone is incomparable sneer, "after all, human immortal such trash you Star Peak are accepting, what good pups can come out of the trash pile?"
<br><br>Liu Yan looked at Guo Shijie, he sat on the chair, his face can not hide the look of excitement and pride.
<br><br>Garbage heap ......
<br><br>Liu Yan's hand under his sleeve clenched his fist.
<br><br>Thinking about the human immortal that he had not yet figured out, at this moment Liu Yan couldn't care less about anything else. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>She sneered at Guo Shijie, "A mere small success is also worth such excitement and thrill for the peak master Guo? He even came all the way to my Star Peak to show off."
<br><br>"Peak Master Guo is also really too pattern-less."
<br><br>"A minor accomplishment? District?" Guo Shijie snorted, full of disdain, "Then please ask Peak Master Liu to find me a disciple who has only practiced for a few days to become a District Minor Achievement."
<br><br>"I don't have one that has achieved a small success." Liu Yan said.
<br><br>"Haha!" Guo Shijie laughed out loud, his words were all mocking, "Reasonable, understand understand, after all, looking for gold in the garbage pile is simply a fool's dream!"
<br><br>After saying that, he got up, looked at Liu Yan's blackened face, laughed loudly, ready to go out and go.
<br><br>Liu Yan took a breath and suppressed the turbid air in his heart.
<br><br>"A few days to refine into a small into such trash I do not have." Liu Yan said out loud, "There is one who has practiced to perfection."
<br><br>Guo Shijie's feet that crossed the threshold of the hall stalled.
<br><br>"Sorry, just said the wrong thing."
<br><br>Liu Yan suddenly said again, his body leaning back, slightly lazy.
<br><br>At that, Guo Shijie let out a sigh of relief, and his foot that was stuck in mid-air was put down.
<br><br>Just a sigh of relief, he heard Liu Yan's voice behind him sounded again.
<br><br>"To be precise, not a few days, but a night, to say the least, it should only count as half a day."
<br><br>After a pause, Liu Yan raised the corner of his mouth and said, "So Lord Guo Feng, so it's correct to say that Xiaocheng is the district, right?"
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>Guo Shijie first froze, and then snorted in disbelief, "Is Peak Master Liu daydreaming?"
<br><br>"A night of consummation, haha, you can really put the joke."
<br><br>"Than it's okay, try hard, the garbage pile also find the remnants of the root leftovers well."
<br><br>"Bragging is your fault."
<br><br>Liu Yan calmly looked at Guo Shijie, "lie to you, not so much. Guo Fengmai is also too high on himself."
<br><br>Seeing this, the mockery and playfulness on Guo Shijie's face faded away.
<br><br>"Impossible, just one night and you want to practice to perfection, the lowest level of gong method is impossible." Guo Shijie said, thought of something and looked askance at Liu Yan, "Practicing to perfection, it wouldn't be a mortal gong method, right?"
<br><br>Liu Yan sneered, "My Sun Moon Sect's One Thought Finger is a mortal merit method?"
<br><br>"One Thought Finger?"
<br><br>Guo Shijie's eyes narrowed with scorn and suspicion, "If there really is such a person, you tell us who it is?"
<br><br>"What's the hurry, Guo Fengmai calm down a bit." Liu Yan said warmly, "What is there to be anxious about when the One Thought Finger is perfected in just one night's practice?"
<br><br>After saying that, she picked up the tea cup and lightly sip the tea.
<br><br>"Impossible, never ......"
<br><br>"Why is it impossible?"
<br><br>Liu Yan interrupted Guo Shijie's speech, impatient with his incessant questioning and disbelief.
<br><br>"You have not seen it can only say that you have seen the world or too little. Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist." Liu Yan directly spoke sarcastically.
<br><br>Guo Shijie was made a little angry by Liu Yan's direct dislike back, he sneered, "More talk is useless, you just pull out the disciple who practiced the One Thought Finger to perfection in one night, so that I can see the world."
<br><br>"Indeed you should, or let Peak Master Guo see the world."
<br><br>"Don't be in a hurry, he should be here soon."
<br><br>Shortly after the words fell, someone came in from outside.
<br><br>"In reply to Peak Master, the man has been brought."
<br><br>"Just in time, let him come in." Liu Yan commanded.
<br><br>And then turned his head to look at Guo Shijie, "Peak Master Guo, the time has come for you to see the world."
<br><br>Guo Shijie smiled and couldn't help but brace himself to look at the entrance of the hall.
<br><br>Emotions brewed in his eyes.
<br><br>The next moment, Guo Shijie saw the visitor.
<br><br>A mouthful of lifted breath loosened up.
<br><br>He laughed out loud, "The one that Peak Master Liu told me could be practiced to perfection in one night, it wouldn't be this Human Immortal, right?"
<br><br>"Exactly."
<br><br>"Hahahaha!" Guo Shijie's laughed out loud, "Using a human immortal to stall me, not so much!"
<br><br>Liu Yan frowned at Guo Shijie's laughing appearance. Said once not believe twice not believe, and still such a face.
<br><br>The same as a fool who has never seen the world.
<br><br>It is really disgusting.
<br><br>Next to Guo Shijie is still laughing, as if he heard some big joke.
<br><br>He reached out and pointed at the human immortal, "If this trash human immortal can cultivate the One Thought Finger to perfection in one night, I'll eat shit on the spot!"
<br><br>As soon as Yi Feng came in, he heard Guo Shijie's mocking laughter, and this extremely contemptuous remark, and his face darkened.
<br><br>This idiot, actually here again!
