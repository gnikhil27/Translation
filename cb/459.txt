<br><br>But this black-robed man was thrown out of sight in an instant?
<br><br>After the shock.
<br><br>He raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>Sure enough, it was the person he needed to find, and he didn't look at the wrong person.

<br><br>The appearance of the centipede immediately made the onlookers watch and point.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"Rob you so what, this big master is bullying men and women."
<br><br>The dog likewise covered himself up with his black robe and emitted an arrogant voice.
<br><br>And as the voice fell, he hurriedly winked at the dark Bones Ben Wei and shouted in a low voice, "Brother, the girl is coming, get ready to strike, remember to move fast and have a handsome posture."
<br><br>Sure enough.
<br><br>At the side of the street, a sword-wielding girl with good looks and a pretty figure, slowly came this way.
<br><br>Seeing this, Bone Ben Wei's eyes lit up.
<br><br>Tied black robe on top, wearing tight pants underneath, feet on bean shoes from mid-air, a heel landed in the field.
<br><br>A group of dashing.
<br><br>"Tie, where the thieves, under broad daylight, actually dare to bully men and women?"
<br><br>"See how this slag man will do justice to heaven."
<br><br>After saying that, Bones Ben Wei slapped a palm towards the dog.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>The dog let out a miserable cry and flew out backwards, clutching his chest and saying reluctantly, "Good, what a powerful slap, today I concede, count yourselves lucky!"

<br><br>"Doing the right thing for heaven is all due, due haha ......"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei arched his palms towards the surrounding area, and passed out a polite voice.

<br><br>Finally, when that woman came closer, Bone Ben Wei feet bean shoes on the ground gently crushed, in place turned around, will be propped up palms on the wall next to her, full of deep emotion to look at her.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The woman but directly brushed past ......
<br><br>Just passed by.
<br><br>Didn't even look at Bones Ben Wei.
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei was dumbfounded and hurriedly transmitted a voice for help.
<br><br>"Dog, what's wrong, said that the girl would throw herself at me?"
<br><br>The dog rushed out from nowhere and said schematically, "Don't panic, big brother, this is a normal reaction."
<br><br>"What does that mean?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei asked.
<br><br>"Brother, think about it, women are shy, out of women's reserve, plus this public, she certainly not good for you to embrace ah."

<br><br>"Auntie stay."
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei shouted behind him.
<br><br>"What is it?"
<br><br>Finally, the woman turned back to look at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Among the many beings, we can meet, do you think we are not destined to meet?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei approached with deep emotion.
<br><br>"In my heart, the girl's heavenly appearance, perfect, just like, just like this beautiful rose in my hand ......"
<br><br>Saying that, Bones Ben Wei remembered the details of the dog's command, stepped on the beans shoes and turned around in place, and pulled the rose out of his pocket by hand.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>But only a lone stick remains.
<br><br>Skeleton Benway was dumbfounded and hurriedly turned over his pocket, finding that the petals had long since fallen out of his pocket.
<br><br>"Boring."
<br><br>The woman's eyes flashed a touch of disgust, plus the previous skeleton Ben Wei that despicable acting by her a glance through, the heart directly identified this black robe is not a good person.

<br><br>The skeleton Ben Wei held up the branch, frozen in place, Chu Chu pitiful.
<br><br>"Big brother, carry on."
<br><br>Seeing this, the three dogs hurried to follow, all kinds of comfort.
<br><br>"Big brother, that must be a realistic woman."
<br><br>"Yes, she doesn't deserve your love."
<br><br>"This kind of woman, too pretentious, obviously like you in your heart, but also pretend to be noble, this kind of woman should not be."
<br><br>The three of them chattered and said.
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei half-heartedly.
<br><br>"Definitely yes."
<br><br>The three patted their chests.
<br><br>"So that's how it is, this Jagged Man almost doesn't feel confident in himself." Bone Ben Wei stuck his waist up and laughed out loud, "That's right, it's just a realistic woman, don't want it."
<br><br>On the restaurant.
<br><br>Lv Xinwei, who witnessed the whole thing, had a wonderful face.
<br><br>He thought these few goods planning something big, but it turns out this is it?
<br><br>That despicable acting skills and embarrassing manner, simply make him cry and laugh.

<br><br>Before the skeleton Ben Wei ignored him out of arrogance.

<br><br>Looking at the arrogant Lu Xinwei, Bone Ben Wei inclined his head and faintly glanced at him.
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Popping out a word from his mouth plainly, he led the few dogs away.
<br><br>And then.
<br><br>There was no more then ......
<br><br>The air, it just froze ......
