At this moment she saw that in the dirt at the feet of that Yi Feng, there was a small shovel stuck in the dirt.
<br><br>"This shovel is ......"
<br><br>Li Jiaxin hold back the heart of the appalled, gaze dead on this shovel, at first look, simply did not find it out of the ordinary, look carefully only surprised to find that the aura that emanates from it also affects her divine will, especially above there is a wisp of the power of the great dao.
<br><br>This is the treasure of the Dzung, no, the holy product?
<br><br>At the same time, Xu Mozhu on the side also saw this scene, his face was also filled with incredulity.
<br><br>His strength might be slightly lower than Li Jiaxin, but he was at least the Grand Elder of the Imperial Sword Sect, so his eyesight would not be lower than that.
<br><br>He obviously also recognized that the small shovel seemed to be a Saint's Grade treasure.
<br><br>But at that moment, another item was inadvertently discovered by the two.
<br><br>It was a sickle in a bamboo basket next to the boulder, which was inadvertently placed and just missed a corner, and was caught by the two men.
<br><br>Hiss!
<br><br>Two people subconsciously looked at each other.
<br><br>Both from each other's eyes, saw a strong shock, actually another piece of treasure with the same breath as the small shovel!
<br><br>The Saint's treasure, this person can actually just take out?
<br><br>The two people were like dreaming.
<br><br>"Have you ever seen an expert below Martial Saint able to take out two Saint-grade divine weapons with their hands?" Xu Mozhu subconsciously asked.
<br><br>"No, I haven't seen it."
<br><br>Li Jiaxin's body trembled slightly as she responded, one of these treasures would already be a heavenly gift, let alone two.
<br><br>"Then wouldn't that mean ......" Xu Mozhu said apprehensively.
<br><br>Before Xu Mozhu finished, Li Jiaxin picked up, "Martial Saint experts?"
<br><br>The voice fell, the two people's hearts slightly trembled.
<br><br>It also did not occur to them that their previous wrong guess about Yi Feng's Martial Sage realm was still wrong, this youth, was even stronger than they had imagined.
<br><br>But thinking about it, Li Jiaxin's heart is thick with ecstasy, for their own move to send out the ring of space also feel grateful.
<br><br>She was still drumming in her heart, giving a treasure like the Ring of Space to an Yi Feng, wasn't it a bit not worth it, but now it seems that it was totally worth it!
<br><br>"Since Miss Li gifted me this ring, then you friend I Yi Feng is sure to make." Yi Feng opened the storage ring, directly collected all those beast's corpses into it, and said towards Li Jiaxin contentedly.
<br><br>Hearing that, Li Jiaxin's excited mood was hard to calm.
<br><br>What she was waiting for, was these words!
<br><br>And Xu Mozhu also looked at Li Jiaxin, after knowing that Yi Feng might be a Martial Saint expert, he no longer dared to say that the ring Li Jiaxin gave out was not worth it, instead, he was filled with envy.
<br><br>Envious of the Li family, another big leg to hold on to.
<br><br>It's just that he, Xu Mozhu, simply can't get such a treasure, otherwise, he is bound to offer this one too.
<br><br>Such an expert's favor, than some extraneous things are much more precious ah!
<br><br>After some pleasantries, Xu Mozhu and Li Jiaxin then left.
<br><br>"Tsk, Li Gu, congratulations to your Li family!" Along the way, Xu Mozhu's words were still sour, it seems that the Li family is worthy of the Li family, this decisiveness is not comparable to ordinary people, and thanks to their Li family can be so strong.
<br><br>The hateful thing is, he Xu Mozhu hands have no treasure that can't be taken ah!
<br><br>And even if he has a good treasure, after the treasure out, I'm afraid it will not have that effect ah!
<br><br>For Xu Mozhu's congratulations, Li Jiaxin was extremely flattered, and also felt a little satisfaction for her previous decisive action of taking out the Space Ring.
<br><br>If it was not so decisive, I'm afraid it really would not have such a good effect ah!
<br><br>"Well, hurry up and find Renhao!" Li Jiaxin said.
<br><br>"Right, right, almost forgot about Renhao, he's not in any danger, right?" Xu Mozhu only suddenly remembered and let out a cold sweat, his precious disciple is not even out of danger yet.
<br><br>"There shouldn't be any danger." Li Jiaxin frowned and said, "I see that the demonic beasts in this large mountain range territory, since childhood including the demon emperor, have been used as game by that one."
<br><br>"That's true." Xu Mozhu then breathed a sigh of relief, the nearby mountain range, except for some small demons that can not yet be transformed, really can not see other demon beasts, and these small demons, with Li Renhao's strength, can completely solve.
<br><br>Sure enough, it didn't take long for the two of them to see Li Renhao sitting on the edge of a broken cliff.
