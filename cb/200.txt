"Thump, thump, thump ......"
<br><br>Guitar sound floated away.
<br><br>Due to the impact of the task, the recent Yi Feng is considered to have regained the pleasure of playing the guitar.
<br><br>Sometimes people are like that.
<br><br>Interest or something, if it is not used for a long time, it will slowly forget.
<br><br>After regaining, re-invigorated Yi Feng's love for the guitar.
<br><br>Qin, chess, calligraphy and painting four items, if you really say that there is interest, it is the piano, so even if the piano skills have reached the realm of God than, but Yi Feng will still play a daily play.
<br><br>Not for other.
<br><br>For the interest.
<br><br>Also for the sentiment.
<br><br>And in addition to Yi Feng, the bottom of the stage is also full of audience. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Weeding, loosening the soil, digging, carrying dung, in addition to the family next door, Master Wang, the opposite beef stall vendors, vendors next door selling pork Pork Rong, diagonally across the street selling rouge Flower Sister ...... and many others.
<br><br>At the moment, everyone is immersed in the sound of Yi Feng's piano.
<br><br>A song fell.
<br><br>The crowd was not yet finished.
<br><br>"Alas, sir's zither skill is really too superb, the dao contained in it, even to our realm, can't perceive its ten thousandth!" Wu Yonghong sighed.
<br><br>"No, if the realm is a little lower, I'm afraid I can only listen to the song, only know how good it sounds, but do not know what it means." Sun Zhuge also similarly lamented.
<br><br>"Let's have another song of the ordinary road."
<br><br>Looking at the admiration at the bottom of the stage, Yi Feng said with a smile, after all, the guitar he played, so many people like it, or quite a sense of accomplishment.
<br><br>Subsequently, a guitar song of the ordinary road, leisurely open.
<br><br>This song, Yi Feng will play every day.
<br><br>Not for other.
<br><br>Because like.
<br><br>Especially the true meaning of the song, and his life here also fits perfectly.
<br><br>Crossing over, he stumbled along the way, longing, fearful, also looked forward to seeing the world, also want to hold the green blade, stroll the end of the world.
<br><br>The chicken-ribbed system brought him a big blow at the time, making the ideal broken, helpless to cower in the martial arts school also once made him very resentful.
<br><br>But thinking back, life is not so!
<br><br>Although the world is not ordinary, but what about the cultivator, will also live to the end, will also be cut off by the sword.
<br><br>Rather, ordinary life, as an ordinary person.
<br><br>Comfortable is good.
<br><br>It is good to be dashing and at ease.
<br><br>"Grass!"
<br><br>"Luckily, my son hid well, otherwise he would have burped."
<br><br>Just then, Yu Wujie, who had just come out of the dirt, came from the street, and just cursed twice in his mouth, he saw a bunch of people gathered in front of the martial arts school.
<br><br>With the intention of watching the fun, he also quietly walked over.
<br><br>"Huh, I didn't know I was here, but it's this loser!" Yu Wujie looked at Yi Feng who was immersed in his guitar with his eyes closed, and a disdainful voice came out.
<br><br>However, when the guitar sound entered his ears, he was instantly surprised.
<br><br>This sound, so nice.
<br><br>And this song, also seems to be very wonderful ah, he a cultivator listening to this song mind are calmed down.
<br><br>Unknowingly, he also fell deep into it.
<br><br>After a long, long time, the sound of the guitar slowly stopped.
<br><br>Many people at the bottom of the stage looked at Yi Feng with gratitude and excitement.
<br><br>There are also many people who think it sounds good and clap their hands.
<br><br>"Tch, this punk is not very good at other things, but I have to say, playing this crap is really okay."
<br><br>In the corner, Yu Wujie couldn't help but nod his head as well.
<br><br>Although he despised Yi Feng, this punk, but this tune he didn't have to hack, even he left far and wide, this tune still echoed in his mind.
<br><br>"Yu Wujie, so you are here?"
<br><br>At this time, a figure swept in and stopped in front of Yu Wujie.
<br><br>It was none other than Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Yu Wujie's face changed slightly, full of embarrassment, his eyes not daring to look directly at Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>"Oh, yes, yes!"
<br><br>Obviously, the reason why he didn't return to the Castle Peak Sect and instead wandered around in this street was to avoid Peng Xian'er.
<br><br>After all, at that time, he swore that he would open the earth gate, but he hid in the dirt for many days.
<br><br>This, pressed no face to see.
<br><br>"You really surprised me, not only opened into the earth door opened the door to heaven, actually still unharmed." Under the veil, Peng Xian'er came out with an appreciative voice.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"Heaven's Gate?"
<br><br>"I opened the Heavenly Gate?"
<br><br>Yu Wujie's face was shocked and he asked with an incredulous face.
<br><br>"Didn't you open it?" Peng Xian'er frowned slightly.
<br><br>Yu Wujie's eyes twinkled and immediately understood the meaning of Peng Xian'er's words, obviously the Heavenly Gate was opened for some reason and Peng Xian'er misunderstood it was him, so he hurriedly said, "Ah, yes, yes, look at my memory, it was me who opened it, hahaha ......"
<br><br>It just so happens that he has no face to see Peng Xian'er, which is better to take the plan and answer it.
<br><br>"But after you opened the Heavenly Gate, why didn't you come to me?" Peng Xian'er leisurely asked: "Could it be, you don't want the reward."
<br><br>"This, what is there to find, after all, you are busy well, and open a mere heavenly gate to, what reward right!" Yu Wujie laughed with a snort.
<br><br>Obviously, he is still very weak-minded.
<br><br>Under the veil, Peng Xian'er's face showed surprise.
<br><br>The Yu Wujie in front of her seemed to be a little different from what she knew!
<br><br>With his piggish appearance, after opening the Heavenly Gate, he actually did not come to her to claim credit?
<br><br>This really made her impressed.
<br><br>"Then, in that case, why don't you follow me from now on?" Peng Xian'er's gaze moved slightly and said softly.
<br><br>"Haha, like this, is this good?" Yu Wujie still had no bottom in his heart, because he knew in his heart that the opening of the Heavenly Gate really had nothing halfway to do with him.
<br><br>"Could it be that you don't want to become my man?" Peng Xian'er threw out an olive branch, jade hand fell on Yu Wujie's chin, gently picking it up, leisurely said.
<br><br>This kind of attitude of Peng Xian'er immediately made Yu Wujie's mind feverish.
<br><br>Look to Peng Xian'er's gaze is full of fervor, also regardless of revealing or not, with this Peng Xian'er away.
<br><br>Days, quietly passed.
<br><br>All the forces are staring at Jiang Yu's tomb.
<br><br>And after so long, the organs inside seemed to have been exhausted, and the most terrifying black mist phantom, seemed to have dissipated.
<br><br>The crowd estimated that in half a day at most, they would be able to re-enter the ancient tomb.
<br><br>So at this moment, at the entrance of the stone door, countless cultivators had already gathered.
<br><br>The faces of every one of them were full of sufficient confidence, and they were determined to get the treasures inside.
