Originally, they wanted to crush with numbers, but they were completely crushed instead.
<br><br>The three men sweated coldly and pulled their legs out to run.
<br><br>However, however.
<br><br>A thousand yellow hair but two groups of two, rub up skills, five hundred rotating light ball instantly condensed out.
<br><br>"Oh TM take kidney Gan ......"
<br><br>"Oh TM take kidney Gan ......"
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>A neat voice came out from the mouths of a thousand people, and five hundred spiral pills smashed directly towards these thirty people.
<br><br>Instantly.
<br><br>Thirty people became ash.
<br><br>"Immortal beasts, out." Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The other elder was facing a monk in a robe.
<br><br>This monk looked mediocre, but this elder did not take the enemy lightly and summoned his contracted immortal beast right from the start.
<br><br>Once the immortal beast emerged, its aura was overwhelming.
<br><br>It swept up high and unfolded its sharp claw marks towards the monk and grabbed him.
<br><br>In an instant, the monk was caught in the hands.
<br><br>The old man's expression moved when he saw this, and he hurriedly shouted, "Kill him."
<br><br>The immortal beast exhaled its snort, and with a fierce movement of its eyes, it was about to grasp the monk into pieces.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>The monk, however, suddenly looked up at it, and the forced chattering voice continued to come out from the mouth full of saliva.
<br><br>"Man and demon spirit are both born of mother, the difference is that man is born of man his mother, demon is born of demon his mother ...... your mother's name?"
<br><br>"To be a demon is like being a human, you have to have a kind heart, with a kind heart, you are no longer a demon, a human demon."
<br><br>Once this voice fell, the immortal beast face continued to twitch, only to feel a mysterious force destroying its dao heart, holding its head launched a madness, picked up a knife on the ground and thrust it towards its heart.
<br><br>After a mouthful of blood was spat out, the immortal beast committed suicide and died.
<br><br>Along with the death of the contracted beast, the old man stared wide eyed suffered a backlash and also spat out a mouthful of blood as well.
<br><br>The monk turned his gaze to him again.
<br><br>The old man couldn't help but shiver, his heart and soul trembled tremendously, his eyes were filled with fear.
<br><br>"Master, what is your mother's name?"
<br><br>Finally, the monk's voice came out again.
<br><br>"Pfft."
<br><br>Another mouthful of old blood spat out, and the old man became insane, took out his dagger, and died by suicide.
<br><br>And at the moment the old man fell to the ground, another monk with a Dharma cap on his head, wearing a robe and holding a duster, rushed up to the sky next to him.
<br><br>"Carved insects and small skills, how dare you class the tiger."
<br><br>"Da Wei Tian Long, Da Luo Fa Mantra, Prajna Buddhas, Prajna Bama coaxing ......"
<br><br>"Great Mighty Heavenly Dragon, World Honored Earth Store, Prajna Buddhas, Prajna Bama Khong ......"
<br><br>The voice fell.
<br><br>The ground ruins exploded with a loud bang.
<br><br>Two old men of Baiyang True Palace died under the ruins at once.
<br><br>In the sky.
<br><br>A man holding a bow and arrow, pulling the bow and shooting arrows in one go, three old men of Baiyang True Palace were directly penetrated by the bow and arrow, but the arrow swept towards the mid-air.
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Wu Changan, who was lying on the recliner, jumped up in fright.
<br><br>"This guy, he's not going to fuck the sun down, is he?"
<br><br>The good thing was.
<br><br>It didn't happen as he expected.
<br><br>"Fortunately, these wood carvings are only the master's previous carvings, and are not fine products, if we take out his fine products, I'm afraid this sun will really be gone."
<br><br>Patted his chest, revealing a look of relief, re-lay down on the recliner.
<br><br>And seeing that so many people died on his side just after the battle, Lu Zhengyi stared with eyes full of gloom.
<br><br>"Can not continue to fight like this, all listen to my order, gather together, set up a formation to launch a true Yang strike." Lu Zhengyi shouted.
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>All the experts flew towards Lu Zhengyi and quickly came behind him, lining up in a "crowd" position.
<br><br>"Formation!"
<br><br>The leader, Lu Zhengyi, shouted, and his hand seals flew out.
<br><br>At the same time, the palms of all the experts of Baiyang True Palace fell on the body of one person in front of them, using this as a coal to concentrate the power transmission to Lu Zhengyi's body.
<br><br>This moment.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's hair towered, his eyes flashed red, and his aura rose to the sky.
<br><br>"Immortal Technique, True Yang Strike."
<br><br>As he let out a loud shout, a pillar of light that burned like the blazing sun coalesced among his hands and burst out.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>When this strike was struck, the heaven and earth changed.
<br><br>And the pillar of light, in the midst of shooting, also became larger and larger, so that the entire battlefield full of smoke, filled with light.
<br><br>And to perform this strike, Lu Zhengyi people's faces are bleached a lot, obviously is not a small consumption.
<br><br>And their eyes were staring at this pillar of light with dead eyes, full of expectation.
<br><br>If there is no accident, this strike should be able to destroy most of the wooden sculptures.
<br><br>But at that moment, a man with a long sword at his waist, a long hair tied behind his head, a slender but not coarse figure, with a pair of sword eyebrows suddenly appeared.
<br><br>His movements were flowing and fluid, just like a man of the wind!
<br><br>Immediately afterwards, he waved his long sword and one met this True Yang strike.
<br><br>"Humph, looking for death."
<br><br>Seeing this scene, Lu Zhengyi and the others revealed disdainful voices.
<br><br>Daring to face their True Yang Strike like this was undoubtedly seeking death.
<br><br>But the next moment.
<br><br>It made them dumbfounded.
<br><br>"Hassa, hassa, hassa to ......"
<br><br>The man shouted under his breath while waving his long sword, erecting a huge wall of wind in front of him.
<br><br>True Yang strike fell on top of the wind wall, it did not even set off a wave, directly disappeared.
