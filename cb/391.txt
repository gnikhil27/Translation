After descending into the Immortal River, Su Xuanjun looked straight at the direction of the island.
<br><br>"A group of mole crickets, for no reason delayed me so much time, took my immortal weapon, captured my subordinates, and even dared to offend my emperor, this is unbearable."
<br><br>"Today, this emperor will personally take action to exterminate your group of mole crickets."
<br><br>But just as he was about to kill, his footsteps suddenly stopped.
<br><br>There was a strong unbelievable look in his eyes, because at that moment the divine soul he left on the island suddenly discovered something.
<br><br>"This this this, what is this ......"
<br><br>The divine soul body was staring at a wooden sculpture not far away, and a panicked voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>It was a statue of a kitten, occupied with mud and undried water stains, resting upside down in the sandy ground like that.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>It was such a seemingly discarded wooden sculpture that made him feel his heart and soul tremble, and a glance with one of the cat's eyes almost made his divine soul directly destroyed.
<br><br>He hurriedly moved his gaze away from the wooden sculpture. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>By a good coincidence, he came face to face with another thing.
<br><br>It was a scythe thrown on the ground, with the same unclean water stains on it.
<br><br>But to a glance, the scythe seemed to tremble a little, invisible a flash of blade light directly towards him.
<br><br>"Ah!"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun's divine soul emitted a silent scream, this slash was actually weakening his divine soul by ninety-nine percent.
<br><br>The only remaining power of his soul was so fragile that if a slightly stronger force came, it would cause him to become nothing.
<br><br>He was terrified and tried to get away from the wooden sculpture and the scythe, but he had just moved a few steps when the scene came to his eyes, almost scaring him out of his mind.
<br><br>Where the sun shines, shelved all kinds of items, just like rags everywhere.
<br><br>And these items Su Xuanjun could see at a glance, none of them are ordinary goods.
<br><br>In addition to the existence of many immortal weapon level, there are even many so Su Xuanjun can not determine its level, only to feel the terror and power!
<br><br>The first thought when he saw these things, Su Xuanjun wanted to take them for himself.
<br><br>But when he thought deeper, he completely dispelled this idea.
<br><br>Such treasures, even one of them, are not easy to get, the owner either has a very high status, or is a superb strength.
<br><br>And he just like a rag on the ground, did not set up any protection, seemingly atrocious, but in fact, also indicates another layer of things.
<br><br>That is, the owner of these treasures, simply not afraid that someone hit the idea.
<br><br>A thought of this.
<br><br>Even Su Xuanjun's father, who was far away at the barrier between the two worlds, had cold sweat dripping from his forehead and could not help but feel fear.
<br><br>If he really had thoughts about these treasures just now, I'm afraid he would be dead by now!
<br><br>"It's just that ......"
<br><br>"Whose are these things anyway?"
<br><br>"Could it be that there is still a terrifying existence on this island that I can't discover?"
<br><br>Just as Su Xuanjun was standing at the barrier between the two realms frowning and thinking, he suddenly realized that his divine soul body had directly turned into nothingness because of a powerful fluctuation.
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>He was so shocked that he fiercely lifted his head to look, and immediately found that the fluctuation was coming from the direction of the island.
<br><br>He gritted his teeth and vanish towards the direction of the island.
<br><br>He also wanted to see what was going on.
<br><br>The two worlds barrier place is not far from the island, almost in a moment, he arrived at the periphery of the island.
<br><br>He just landed and saw a scene that made his scalp tingle.
<br><br>"Closer and closer to the goal of building the sect, Yi Feng cheer up, complete the task as soon as possible to become a cultivator."
<br><br>"Ollie give!"
<br><br>Yi Feng on the shore finished moving his body and raised his fist to the sky to encourage himself and cheer himself up.
<br><br>This fist, causing the entire sky clouds break open, a cloak of power directly through the dome of the sky.
<br><br>A fist broke the sky.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>"I'm fucking blind, I can't believe I didn't see that he was that terrifying figure!"
<br><br>This scene directly scared Su Xuanjun's soul, making his brain not even able to think, turning his head and running back towards the Immortal Realm.
<br><br>But just as he ran back to the Immortal Realm, he saw a scene that frightened him even more.
<br><br>In the sky of his Qingyu Immortal Continent, a huge fist shadow appeared, causing the entire Qingyu Immortal Continent to be enveloped in a dense pressure, and even more so, bringing about a great commotion.
<br><br>"It's him."
<br><br>"So the wisps that caused turmoil in the Immortal Realm, but made the Heaven's Immortal Hall unable to find the source, were punched by him!"
<br><br>Su Xuanjun stared in disbelief as he stood trembling in place, his heart completely overwhelmed with fear at this moment.
<br><br>He could never have imagined that the white-robed man whom he had despised and even boldly tried just now was the culprit of all this.
<br><br>"Who the hell is he?"
<br><br>"What exactly is his purpose!"
<br><br>"And that punch just now, was it aimed at the immortal world like before, or was it ...... aimed at me!"
<br><br>"But if it was directed at me, how did he let me go just now, with his strength, there is no way he didn't know that my real body was approaching the island ......"
<br><br>One by one, the riddle that appeared in Su Xuanjun's mind, so that his heart chaos like numbness, and fear intertwined, even the muscles of his face are trembling.
