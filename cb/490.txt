"It's Yin Jian."
<br><br>"Oh my, it's actually Yin Jian!"
<br><br>"He's actually not dead and is still within the Heavenly Spirit Sect."
<br><br>"Phew, I can't believe that Yin Jian has come out today, you know, he was the first genius of Yin Tianxiong's era."
<br><br>"Yes, rumor has it that he reached the peak of Xuan Xian long ago, only that he was not interested in the position of sect master, so he let Yin Tianxiong become the sect master, this is definitely one of the legendary figures!"
<br><br>The appearance of the man in white almost caused the entire crowd of onlookers to exclaim.
<br><br>His feet stepped on the mid-air, and a pair of sword eyebrows made the whole person permeated with a sharp color and an overwhelming aura.
<br><br>"Senior brother, this woman is very bizarre, in order to reduce the death and injury of my Heavenly Spirit Sect, I hope senior brother will personally kill this woman." Yin Tianxiong shouted.
<br><br>Yin Jian's gaze twitched.
<br><br>Apparently sensing Su Yunyun's extraordinary, a compelling aura was released from his body and locked straight onto Su Yunyun.
<br><br>The appearance of this person. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Also let Su Yun Yun frowned, a sense of crisis rose in his heart.
<br><br>This person, very strong!
<br><br>This was the first feeling that Yin Jian brought to Su Yun Yun.
<br><br>"It seems, do I have to be serious too?"
<br><br>But Yin Jian's strength did not make Su Yun Yun fearful, instead it stirred up that heart of battle within her.
<br><br>After a short confrontation.
<br><br>Yin Jian moved.
<br><br>The long sword in his hand pointed straight out, the human sword united, deadlocked Su Yun Yun Yun.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>He was just about to attack when the crowd of onlookers on the periphery, suddenly came a shout of alarm.
<br><br>"Look, who is that person?"
<br><br>"Yes, a big battle is about to happen, and this kid still dares to run towards there, does he not want to live?"
<br><br>Heard the words.
<br><br>Yin Jian, who was just about to make his move, inclined his head to look, and found a bald head tied with a cloak flying.
<br><br>Yin Jian's eyes narrowed slightly.
<br><br>Where did the bald ass come from, and also has a pair of dead fish eyes.
<br><br>The target.
<br><br>Seems like it's still him?
<br><br>"Interesting."
<br><br>Yin Jian raised the corners of his mouth, withdrew his attack on Su Yun Yun, and turned his head to look at the bald head that was darting towards him.
<br><br>It was close.
<br><br>The aura was strong.
<br><br>This was Yin Jian's first thought.
<br><br>Facing this kind of enemy who dared to take the initiative against him, Yin Jian never took the enemy lightly, his body sank slightly, and also made a serious stance.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just watching the bald head getting closer and closer, his heart battle passion are about to inspire out ......
<br><br>The bald head that came flying, but brushed past his body.
<br><br>Did not even look at him ......
<br><br>See this scene.
<br><br>Rao to Yin Jian immovable as a mountain state of mind, the face of the horizontal flesh can not help but jump straight.
<br><br>It was.
<br><br>Just ignored him.
<br><br>And caused him to pose for half a day for nothing, which made Yin Jian's self-esteem feel a great insult.
<br><br>"Senior brother, you're finally here, certain people are very angry because of your ignorance." Seeing this bald senior brother arrive, the corners of Su Yun Yun's mouth lifted and a meaningful voice came out.
<br><br>"Wow."
<br><br>"I'm not interested in him, go take a shit first, I've been holding it in for three days."
<br><br>Bai Qi Yu expressionlessly responded, then rushed into the toilet not far away, and sat down on the toilet seat.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>The corners of Su Yunyun's mouth twitched, and her face was full of speechlessness.
<br><br>While Yin Jian heard, the muscles on his face were throbbing non-stop, killing intent unconcealed flowed out.
<br><br>"Leave that woman to you guys first, I'll go deal with that bald ass first!"
<br><br>Yin Jian said in a hoarse voice.
<br><br>"Good!"
<br><br>Yin Tianxiong hastily responded, his gaze subconsciously glanced at the toilet.
<br><br>I don't know where the strange man came from, he had angered his senior brother as soon as he arrived, the consequences were serious ah.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"Pooping is really comfortable ah!"
<br><br>Sitting on the sitting toilet, Bai Qiyu took a diarrhea and breathed a sigh of relief, turning a deaf ear to the arrogant atmosphere outside, touching his pocket, pulling out a comic book and watching it in a serious manner.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>Just then, the entire toilet exploded, all leveled to the ground, scattering up a sky of dust.
<br><br>The dust cleared.
<br><br>Only Bai Qiyu was left holding a book, sitting on the pit with his bare buttocks.
<br><br>A gust of wind blew, buttocks cold, Bai Qi Yu looked up at the head full of cold Yin Jian, could not help but blink the pair of dead fish eyes.
<br><br>"You, too, come to take a shit?"
<br><br>Bai Qi Yu asked seriously.
<br><br>After saying that, he looked at the surrounding ruins, froze, and raised his head again and said, "But you have to wait, I'm constipated."
<br><br>After saying that, he re-read the cartoon.
<br><br>Yin Jian was instantly furious.
<br><br>The palm of his hand raised, a cold sword, stabbed straight towards Bai Qi Yu.
<br><br>Bai Qiyu expressionlessly deflected his head, easily dodged.
<br><br>Another sword cut came.
<br><br>Bai Qi Yu again to the left of the head, unharmed.
<br><br>Immediately after, the harsh sword light surged towards him, but without exception, were easily avoided by Bai Qi Yu tilted his head.
<br><br>Finally.
<br><br>Bai Qi Yu put down the comic book in his hand and looked up at Yin Jian again.
<br><br>"What the hell do you want?"
<br><br>Bai Qi Yu asked with a frown.
<br><br>"I have to say, you are very strong, get up and fight me!" Yin Jian said in a deep voice as a cold light flashed in his eyes.
<br><br>"Oh!"
<br><br>"You want to fight say so earlier."
<br><br>After saying that, Bai Qi Yu blasted out a fist, which landed on Yin Jian's chest in a devastating manner.
<br><br>After a punch, Bai Qi Yu continued to shit.
<br><br>But Yin Jian's eyes were shattered and a large mouthful of blood was spat out along with his internal organs, while his whole body flew backwards like a cannonball.
<br><br>"Boom boom boom boom boom ......"
<br><br>Smashed down a series of buildings, leaving a canyon-like gully on the ground, shocking to the eyes.
