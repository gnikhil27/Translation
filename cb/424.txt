The four men had a stomach full of fire.
<br><br>Although in recent years their four clans have fallen a lot, but not a mortal want to enter just come in.
<br><br>So the four spoke in unison, and an impatient voice came out.
<br><br>"Go go go, blast out blast out."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The disciples answered and hurriedly retreated.
<br><br>In a short while, the disciples pushed the people out.
<br><br>"Don't touch me, I'll go by myself."
<br><br>And the one who was pushed out the door was none other than Yi Feng, being blown out so unceremoniously, he cursed with a black face and shouted, "Tell your master, I am giving you a chance today, it's you who don't cherish it, you will definitely regret it in the future."
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng angrily left.
<br><br>Hm. Remember in one second http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Broken clan.
<br><br>Blind, I am such a promising genius, but I still reject the door.
<br><br>If you don't enter, you don't enter, I don't care.
<br><br>When I finish the system task, can cultivate, must be famous continent, then gas this group of yat.
<br><br>"Hey ah, this dog said the mortal, kinda jump, let me go shoot him."
<br><br>Hearing the shouting vaguely coming from Yi Feng outside, Jian Hengtian, who was already in depression, couldn't help but stand up and drink.
<br><br>He said he was about to get up and go out.
<br><br>"You're okay, it's just a mortal, what's the point of fighting with a mortal when you're the head of a family?" Li Canghai said in a good-natured way.
<br><br>"That's right, that's just a mortal who shouts and shouts, you, he can't really do anything in the future, why put it on your mind." Yun Tianlong also persuaded.
<br><br>"Look at you that little outburst."
<br><br>Liu Gu Yi even directly towards Jian Hengtian to transmit a disdainful voice.
<br><br>"You care about me?"
<br><br>"Competing with a mortal, that's all you've got, and you still want me to dress up in front of you, I pooh."
<br><br>"Hmph, I don't even care about it ......"
<br><br>In a moment, the sound of Liu Gu Yi and Jian Heng Tian's quarrel was heard again in the inner hall.
<br><br>And at this moment, Yi Feng had already made a big circle in Baier City, and he had tried several sects' recruitment points.
<br><br>But none of the sects dared to want him.
<br><br>"Ugh!"
<br><br>"Is it really impossible to join a sect."
<br><br>Yi Feng's face was filled with loss.
<br><br>However, just when Yi Feng was hesitating to give up and simply be a salted fish for the rest of his life, an abrupt voice came from the side.
<br><br>"Young man, although your talent is very poor, but a calm and steady mind, well carved and polished is also a buildable talent ah, do you want to join my Qingniu clan?"
<br><br>An old man, as thin as a bone, was looking at Yi Feng with a smile.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
<br><br>Is this a village of dark flowers?
<br><br>But he still left a point of caution, after all, he was also afraid of being sold out.
<br><br>So he suppressed the excitement in his heart and asked softly, "Is your Green Ox Sect a sect for cultivators?"
<br><br>"Of course."
<br><br>The old man stood with his hands on his head and slightly puffed out his chest.
<br><br>"Is your sect certified?" Yi Feng asked again.
<br><br>"That too, of course, the famous sect is authentic."
<br><br>The old man said in an immortal manner, "And my Green Ox Sect comes from a scary place, the master ancestor is Martial King strongman Wang Qingniu, with a great reputation."
<br><br>"Martial King powerhouse!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but be shocked.
<br><br>It sounds like it's very reliable, and this Martial King title also sounds very awesome!
<br><br>"Then I wonder if you are?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked again in a soft voice.
<br><br>"I am the third patriarch of the Green Ox Sect, Zhu Yingguang!" The old man raised his head and said proudly.
<br><br>"So it's Patriarch Zhu."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly arched his hand and asked tentatively again, "I guess Patriarch Zhu is also very powerful, I wonder if he has reached the Martial Spirit realm?"
<br><br>After saying that.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked his measuring gaze at Zhu Make Light.
<br><br>After all, he also knew that there was no pie falling from the sky for nothing, what if it was an extremely weak sect that tricked himself into digging and moving bricks?
<br><br>So naturally it is better to ask for clarification.
<br><br>"This patriarch happens to be a martial spirit." Zhu makes the light stand with his hands in the air, rather proudly said.
<br><br>Hearing this, Yi Feng's eyes instantly lit up.
<br><br>At the beginning, he had seen the power of Martial Spirit experts in Nansha, so since this Zhu Yingguang was able to reach the Martial Spirit realm, then this clan should be quite good.
<br><br>"You know about our clan almost well, are you interested in joining?" Zhu Make Light looked at Yi Feng and asked leisurely.
<br><br>"Yes, I'm in, meet the sect master."
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly arched his hand.
<br><br>Hearing that, Zhu makes the light raise his eyebrows, his face's filled with thick joy.
<br><br>Whoops.
<br><br>My goodness.
<br><br>Finally, I've coaxed one.
<br><br>At this moment, the corners of Zhu Huiguang's eyes directly moistened.
<br><br>Because the entire Immortal River continent has many requirements for the existence of each sect, the establishment of a sect needs to be qualified not to mention that the established sects also have an annual assessment.
<br><br>Of course, different grades of sects are facing different assessment standards.
<br><br>The sect rank is divided into one to nine grades, one grade is the strongest, nine grade is the weakest.
<br><br>Take the ninth grade sect, the minimum to maintain the sect has a hundred disciples, the minimum annual absorption of fresh blood ten people.
<br><br>And he Green Bull clan was created in the early days, under the leadership of the Green Bull Martial King, the most flourishing period is already developed to the eighth grade sect.
<br><br>But then gradually decline, and lowered to the ninth grade, to now the entire sect is only a few dozen people, so even the ninth grade can not be maintained, immediately facing dissolution.
<br><br>This is not, Zhu makes light as the patriarch personally down the mountain to collect people.
<br><br>But who knows, today's competition is actually so big, slightly talented disciples can enter the four clans, he such a small clan can not even drink soup.
<br><br>So, he can only coax some mortals to fill the number.
<br><br>But even more depressing is that even the mortals are not willing to join his Green Bull Sect, because as the locals know, his Green Bull Sect is about to face dissolution.
<br><br>The good thing is, the sky is not a burden to those who have a heart!
<br><br>Now together with Yi Feng, in pulling together some relatives and friends, his Green Ox Sect should be just enough to face this sect test.
<br><br>However, absolutely can not let this kid in front of me know the embarrassing situation of my Green Bull clan ah, or run away what to do?
<br><br>To know that some time ago he also coaxed a few, the results just into the sect ran away.
