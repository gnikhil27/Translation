"You'll see."
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>White Leader Sky held out a book with both hands and carefully placed it on the table next to him.
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Seeing this book, Yuen Long Tian's eyes stared like ox eyes and also trembled sharply.
<br><br>Under the glare and smacking his lips, he cheated his head and asked in a trembling voice, "Is this, is this that divine skill of Lord Wu Tian?"
<br><br>"Lord Wu Tian holds that divine skill as a supreme treasure and never leaves his form, this is not that book of Lord Wu Tian, but this one in front of me is exactly the same as that one!"
<br><br>White Leader Tian said solemnly.
<br><br>There was not the slightest surprise at this appearance of Yuen Long Tian.
<br><br>When he was at the banquet at the Imperial Palace, Wu Tian had brought out that divine skill together when he talked about that gentleman who had been kind to him.
<br><br>So they had the honor to witness it. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>All the people in the room were amazed, and could not forget that shocking scene for a long time.
<br><br>Now, when they see the same divine skill again, they can still keep the appearance of not losing their mind too much.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian cautiously stroked the book help, and his breathing was clearly and audibly rushed.
<br><br>"So this book ......"
<br><br>"Is it his?"
<br><br>Said Yuen Long Tian, turning his shocked gaze towards Yi Feng's room.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>White Collar Sky solemnly nodded his head.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian gulped and asked again, "In other words, this one is the same as Lord Wu Tian, who also received blessings from that gentleman?"
<br><br>Speaking of this.
<br><br>He finally understood why White Leader Tian was making that gesture at the entrance of Yi Feng's room just now.
<br><br>If that was really the case, then the actions of Bai Lingtian just now were really not at all excessive, and the slap he received was not aggrieved.
<br><br>After all, Lord Wu Tian, who was also blessed by that mysterious gentleman, relied on divine skills to become the first person in Wu Tian and became the king of Wu Tian.
<br><br>Then this person who received the same blessing, I'm afraid that the strength of the position is not far behind.
<br><br>Take a step back.
<br><br>Even if this person is not strong, just by the fact that he has a relationship with that mysterious gentleman, Wu Tian will treat him as a sitting guest because of that when he finds out.
<br><br>"I don't think so."
<br><br>White Leader Tian's pupils shrank and shook his head in response.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian let out a sigh of relief.
<br><br>If that was really the case, then things would be a big mess, especially with his previous move of preparing to break into the door, not to mention whether this one would be angry, if it reached Wu Tian's mouth, he was afraid that he would have to eat his words.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"Luckily."
<br><br>"Fortunately not."
<br><br>Thinking of this, he once again let out a big sigh of relief.
<br><br>Next to him, White Leader Tian glanced at him, then said more solemnly, "He should, be that gentleman himself!"
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Yuen Long Tian nodded consciously, secretly saying that as long as it wasn't the same kind as Lord Wu Tian, it would be fine.
<br><br>It's just that gentleman himself, there's nothing ......
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>"That gentleman himself?"
<br><br>Only at this moment did he suddenly realize what was wrong.
<br><br>The eyes fiercely stared, all like an electric shock in place, mouth loudly exclaimed: "You mean, this, is that gentleman himself?"
<br><br>"Not bad!"
<br><br>White collar days solemnly nodded.
<br><br>"Because Lord Wu Tian said, that gentleman, surnamed Yi!"
<br><br>"And this one, also surnamed Yi!"
<br><br>This cold confirmation caused a thunderstorm to resound in Yuen Long Tian's head, and even more so, he directly sat on his butt on the ground in shock.
<br><br>His face was ashen and filled with dullness.
<br><br>The side of Yuan Jing, is also staring beautiful eyes, jade hand tightly covered red lips, heart flooded with shock waves.
<br><br>She knew through the conversation between Yuen Long Tian and White Leader Tian that Wu Tian, the first person in the empire, had such a past, so she was curious in her heart about what kind of existence that mysterious gentleman who could raise such a person as Wu Tian's ruler was.
<br><br>And now it was a shocking discovery.
<br><br>The brother Yi, with whom she had been spending a lot of time, was the mysterious gentleman who had single-handedly raised the Wu Tian king!
<br><br>How could this not cause her to be shocked?
<br><br>"Daughter, daughter, tell me quickly, is this one really surnamed Yi?"
<br><br>The terrified Yuen Long Tian got up from the ground and hurriedly asked, "And this book, is it his or not?"
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>At this moment, Yuen Long Tian still had a trace of illusion.
<br><br>If this was really that gentleman, regarding what he just did in preparing to break into the door, such a big disrespectful act, if the king of Wu Tian knew about it, I was afraid that he would exterminate his nine clans.
<br><br>"His surname is indeed Yi!"
<br><br>Yuan Jing solemnly said, "And it is true that he took this book to me, and he told me to throw it away as trash."
<br><br>The two of them, White Collar Sky and Yuen Long Sky, choked.
<br><br>But they also knew in their hearts.
<br><br>The identity of this person should be eight or nine.
<br><br>Because although they had never met this person, they could have learned a lot from the Wu Tian Guojun during that wine banquet.
<br><br>They know that this gentleman's style never reveals the mountain nor the water, and always looks like a mortal.
<br><br>And all the supreme treasures and divine skills in everyone's eyes, in this gentleman's eyes, are just rare and ordinary things.
<br><br>The holy product to wipe the buttocks, the emperor product as a foot wipe, are the true picture of this one.
<br><br>In short.
<br><br>That time Wu Tian Guojun said a lot of many.
<br><br>At the end, he even left tears in front of all his ministers to express his thoughts about that gentleman.
<br><br>And at this moment.
<br><br>To take this book at hand, the move of throwing away as garbage.
<br><br>In the vernacular of their Spiritual Void Realm, such a vanilla act, I'm afraid that only this one can do it.
