On the grassland, a group of people eating skewers, dancing around the campfire.
<br><br>Each one had a look of joy on their faces.
<br><br>"This time we have taken down the entire Cloud Top Empire, which means that the Lingxu Realm is all within our grasp."
<br><br>Wu Tian held a wine cup in his hand and said happily, "I think this time, the master will definitely be impressed with us!"
<br><br>"No longer will he think that we are useless people."
<br><br>"Yes." The senior brothers and sisters next to us echoed one after another.
<br><br>You know that the Lingxu Realm is a stronger and independent existence outside of the Immortal River Continent!
<br><br>The crowd joked and laughed, imagining the scene of being praised by the master when they met him.
<br><br>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew by.
<br><br>"Poof!"
<br><br>Everyone looked over, only to see the skeleton Ben Wei, who had just shouted to continue playing music and continue dancing, suddenly lost his voice directly, and then knelt on the ground. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Grand Protector, what's going on?"
<br><br>The crowd was still stunned, they saw a person appear out of thin air and slowly landed.
<br><br>A body of white clothes, windless.
<br><br>Both hands behind, floating and independent.
<br><br>Looking down at them from above.
<br><br>The next moment, the crowd reacted and knelt down.
<br><br>"See the master!"
<br><br>Yi Feng stood in the air and looked coldly at the people kneeling on the ground with his hands behind his back.
<br><br>"Master, we ......," Wu Tian said happily to Yi Feng.
<br><br>Just before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by Yi Feng, "I told you guys to come out and mix up as human beings, and this is the explanation you give me?"
<br><br>"Uh ......" Wu Tian was stunned.
<br><br>Yi Feng's gaze moved away from Wu Tian and swept over a group of people behind him, "Before leaving the mountain, I told you to come out and mix up your human appearance, and this is the human appearance you mixed up?"
<br><br>A sweeping gaze fell on the still-burning campfire, next to the iron shelf is still roasted full of uneaten meat.
<br><br>He became more angry and waved his hand, and the rack fell down with a bang.
<br><br>He said sarcastically, "Is this how you are willing to fall?"
<br><br>He shouted, "Can you have some ability?"
<br><br>"Can you have some pattern?
<br><br>Ah ...... It turned out that the Lingxu realm they were complacent and proud of could not even enter the eyes of their master ......
<br><br>They also celebrated for this.
<br><br>At this time, listening to Yi Feng's teachings of the crowd coincidentally lowered their heads, like the frosted eggplant, each wilted head.
<br><br>Do not dare to say more.
<br><br>Looking at the people are wilted head, Yi Feng angrily long sigh.
<br><br>And then his gaze once again fell on Wu Tian.
<br><br>"What did you just want to say?"
<br><br>"Uh ......" Wu Tian smiled, his face turned red with shame, and hurriedly returned, "Because I didn't break into anything, I wanted to ask Master to condemn me just now!"
<br><br>"Humph!" Yi Feng coldly snorted from his nose, "If next time I see you guys, you still look like this untalented ghost, don't recognize me as a master!"
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng glared at Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>Although kneeling honestly with head bowed.
<br><br>But Yi Feng seems the moment Bone Ben Wei neck subconsciously a shrinkage.
<br><br>"Dog thing, you also know fear?!" He said angrily, carrying Bone Ben Wei a few disappeared in place.
<br><br>To be sure that Yi Feng is no longer there, the crowd has to look up.
<br><br>All of them were full of complicated faces.
<br><br>"Master actually did not even put the Lingxu Realm in his eyes." One of them sighed and said, "Master is still Master, the pattern is simply not something we can compare to."
<br><br>"Still compare, we can't even imagine it." Another person said.
<br><br>"But now it seems that Master doesn't even put the Lingxu Realm in his eyes, what else can he put in his eyes?" Wu Tian couldn't help but frown and ponder.
<br><br>Hearing this, several people looked at each other.
<br><br>Could it be that ......
<br><br>Immortal World, right?
<br><br>"In that case, it seems that Master probably wanted us to make a name for ourselves at first, that is to say in the Immortal Realm." A disciple said, "And not in the Lingxu Realm at all!"
<br><br>"So that's how it is!" The crowd said, remorseful and ashamed, "It's a shame that we are still complacent because we have taken in a mere Lingxu Realm."
<br><br>"That's right, we are sweating!"
<br><br>"In that case, let's depart now!" Someone said, "Right now, let's go to the Immortal Realm and break into the world!"
<br><br>"Good! Let's go now!"
<br><br>"Go!!!"
