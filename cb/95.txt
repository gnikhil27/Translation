"Hiss!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face changed greatly.
<br><br>This was, a Martial Emperor powerhouse.
<br><br>The Explosive Heavenly Clan was actually hiding so deep, and there were still Martial Emperor powerhouses.
<br><br>Finally, the white-robed man cast his gaze over and indifferently asked, "Little Green Mountain Sect, actually daring to attack my Explosive Heavenly Clan, how dare you!"
<br><br>The Old Ancestor of Castle Peak's face was gloomy, but he did not lose his composure and said with his head held high, "I wonder if your Excellency is?"
<br><br>"Ye Bei!"
<br><br>The white-robed man emitted an indifferent voice.
<br><br>"Ye Bei?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Qing Shan was shocked, remembering a legend of Nansha, a genius expert came out of nowhere ten years ago, reached the realm of Martial King at the age of twenty, but just as the sun was shining, this person faded into silence, many people speculated that he died in some secret realm.
<br><br>However, I did not want to join the Explosive Heavenly Gang and become a Martial Emperor powerhouse from Martial Spirit in ten years. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>This kind of talent.
<br><br>Simply terrifying!
<br><br>"I never thought I would run into you here." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said in a deep voice, "But do you know that three elders of your Heaven Frying Gang have been acting recklessly outside and have offended people they shouldn't have offended."
<br><br>"So what?"
<br><br>Ye Bei said indifferently.
<br><br>"You ......" Old Ancestor Qingshan's face turned blue with anger, "So, it was your Heaven Frying Gang that encouraged the three of them to offend the seniors?"
<br><br>"I don't know about their affairs." Ye Bei said indifferently.
<br><br>"Good, since your sect doesn't know, then naturally you won't provoke our sect's war." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said in a deep voice: "But I need your Excellency to hand over those three people, I need to go back and give my word to that senior."
<br><br>At those words, Ye Bei's eyes were raised.
<br><br>"You blew up the flesh of three elders of my clan, and now you're actually coming here to ask for them, you have a big mouth." Ye Bei said in a cold voice: "Isn't what you are considering now how your Qingshan Sect should get out of it?"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak's face was suffocatingly ugly, but still said stiffly, "Your Excellency, this matter is not because of my Castle Peak Sect, but it is about another senior, I hope you can consider it solemnly."
<br><br>"There is no need to consider, there is no way I can hand over the person!" Ye Bei said with an indifferent expression, "Even if there really is any senior to ask for someone, then tell him to roll over himself."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan said in anger: "Well, well, I hope that when you say such words, you measure the consequences clearly?"
<br><br>"You're threatening me?"
<br><br>Ye Bei's face sank, and his palm, which was standing with his hand in the air, suddenly came out.
<br><br>In the next instant, a thick palm print was released bigger and bigger in the sky, like a heavenly might pressing down.
<br><br>Under this pressure, the eighteen guardians beside the old ancestor of Castle Peak could not stand up and fell to the ground, and Zhu Yun in the formation also showed a strong look of concern.
<br><br>"Martial Emperor powerhouse, really powerful!"
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak had a grave look on his face, and did not dare to be careless in the face of such a strong person, the kitchen knife in his hand was immediately sacrificed, and slashed towards the big palm that came from the sky.
<br><br>"Snort!"
<br><br>Under this knife, the sky glowed with dazzling light, and then the terrifying palm print was torn apart and turned into nothingness in mid-air.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Ye Bei, whose face was always calm, finally showed an incredulous look when he saw this.
<br><br>"A small Martial King, actually able to easily break my palm, you are not simple!" Ye Bei said with a cold color flickering on his face, "If you give me that sword, I can bypass your lives."
<br><br>"Humph, no way!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face showed a firm look, this blade was given to him by Yi Feng, how could he hand it over?
<br><br>"No handover?"
<br><br>"Then I'll just have to rob it."
<br><br>Ye Bei's voice had just fallen, and in the next instant, he had already reached the Green Mountain Old Ancestor's eyes, and then a palm slashed over.
<br><br>This palm set off a gust of wind, the air was close to distortion.
<br><br>The old ancestor's face changed greatly, and the kitchen knife in his hand subconsciously slashed out.
<br><br>"Hm?!"
<br><br>A palm chop on the kitchen knife, Ye Bei's face changed greatly, the whole person flew out backwards, and then look at its palm, has become unshaped, emitting intense pain.
<br><br>"Really did not expect, a small Martial King, actually wounded me."
<br><br>Ye Bei narrowed his eyes.
<br><br>"But this kind of supreme divine blade is not something that a punk like you can use, only I, Ye Bei, deserve to have it."
<br><br>With that, he exploded into full speed, and his ghost-like body surrounded the Qingshan Ancestor, launching a harsh attack.
<br><br>Under such a strong attack, space was close to distortion, the ground left a gully, and dust rushed to the sky.
<br><br>At first, the old man could still rely on his divine sword to resist, but the Martial Emperor was one realm higher than the Martial King, so gradually he was unable to do so.
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>"Bang Bang Bang Bang ......"
<br><br>After a series of sonic booms, when the last to sonic boom fell, the old ancestor of the green mountain suddenly flew backwards out, just to get up, a foot palm guessed directly to his chest.
<br><br>"The knife, it's mine."
<br><br>Ye Bei said condescendingly, snatched the knife from the hands of the old ancestor of Castle Peak.
<br><br>"You ...... this is something gifted to me by the senior, you dare to snatch it privately, if it causes the senior's anger, you Explosive Sky Gang should cease to exist!" Qingshan old ancestor shouted angrily.
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>"A mouthful of seniors, I would like to see if there is really such a person?"
<br><br>Ye Bei said disdainfully as his palm snapped open and landed on the top of the Castle Peak Elder's head.
<br><br>"Soul search!"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's face changed greatly, desperately struggling, but powerless, only felt his memories gushing out.
<br><br>A long, long time before Ye Bei raised the corner of his mouth.
<br><br>"There is indeed such a person, but it does not seem to be good, well?"
<br><br>"However, since he was able to gift you with such a divine weapon, I think there must be other good things, in that case, then I will make another trip to find him, just in time for the rise of my Explosive Heavenly Gang, to lay a good foundation!"
<br><br>Saying that, he landed his foot on top of the body of the Old Ancestor of Castle Peak, whose body flew out backwards and landed in the middle of the big formation.
<br><br>"You bunch of trash, just take care of yourselves here!"
<br><br>Saying that, the corner of his mouth raised, his gaze looked in the direction of Pingjiang City, and with a swipe of his body, he flew out.
