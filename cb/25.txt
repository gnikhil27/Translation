 After saying that, Yi Feng mouth corner twitched, this is not cold.
<br><br>Of course, at the beginning Yi Feng is not without speculation, this guy will not be a certain cultivation of the hermit high people, right?
<br><br>But the contact for a long time, Yi Feng has long dispelled this idea.
<br><br>Which hermit senior would be such a look, is not the vertical cloud, high above it?
<br><br>Just think of him as a teenager, there is a dream of cultivation, the change in age, and did not let the second breath with the reduction.
<br><br>Just two well.
<br><br>Yi Feng can also understand, who has not been in the second.
<br><br>In the previous life, the martial arts film watched too much, the bamboo sharpened into a longsword model behind the back, out of the sword always the countryside grandma's doorstep dog tail grass cut a clean, mouth inside also self-matched sound effects.
<br><br>Of course, such a large age is still in the second, really rare.
<br><br>Then Yi Feng went into the house to move out a small table, while also holding a homemade chess set.
<br><br>As a native Yan Huang people, how can not bring this essence to the other world, of course, this is also Yi Feng can not be more to beat the time of things. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The reason why he met with old man Wu is also because when Yi Feng was teaching an old man from the neighborhood to play chess, he happened to pass by and had a great interest in it.
<br><br>Since then, he came to find Yi Feng, not for other things, only for playing chess.
<br><br>Outside the street, the autumn wind was sluggish.
<br><br>Gradually, a drizzling rain fell, slipping down the eaves of the house, dripping down the steps of the table, squatting an old man and a young man.
<br><br>A man in white robes.
<br><br>One person Demoiselle.
<br><br>Any wind and rain lightly brush and come, the two do not move like a mountain, eyes dead on the chessboard.
<br><br>"To be honest, at the beginning, I thought I was on the same level as you." Old man Wu said as the chess pieces fell from his hands while raising the corners of his eyes.
<br><br>"Huh."
<br><br>Yi Feng laughed but did not say anything.
<br><br>"But when I look closely, I can't see through you again." Old man Wu frowned again and said.
<br><br>"Of course you can't see through me." Yi Feng smiled, his face flashed meaningful, while the gun carriage in his hand fell silently, his heart was quite a bit smug, his layout how can old man Wu see through it, a few more steps, he can general.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words made old man Wu frown.
<br><br>Because it is not like talking big.
<br><br>Especially the look of self-congratulation on Yi Feng's face, it was simply a look of taking things for granted.
<br><br>"Could it be, is he really better than me?"
<br><br>Old man Wu had some hard feelings in his heart, perhaps he wouldn't have the slightest obsession for other things, but in this situation, the same two people, it was inevitable that he wouldn't let a trace of climbing heart rise up.
<br><br>No.
<br><br>He quickly dispelled the idea in his heart.
<br><br>The whole world is so big, all kinds of techniques and secret arts are abundant, Yi Feng cultivated a kind of technique that makes others can not see through the cultivation, it is not at all excessive.
<br><br>Just because he couldn't see through it didn't mean he was really inferior to him.
<br><br>"Old Brother Yi, you are complacent when you say that." Old man Wu smiled, while the chess piece in his hand captured one of Yi Feng's knights, and after collecting Yi Feng's chess piece he said meaningfully, "Even though I can't see through you, I think we are still at the same level."
<br><br>"That's not necessarily true."
<br><br>Yi Feng's face is still confident, capturing him a knight, how can he be at the same level with him? You don't know that this horse is for him to eat on purpose, because there is only one step left, he can general.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's face with that look of confidence, old man Wu's heart trembled again.
<br><br>Could it be that he is really better than me?
<br><br>Otherwise, why is he so confident?
<br><br>However, if there really is such a person, he is not an unknown person in the cultivation world, why have I never heard of him?
<br><br>Yi Feng dropped the chess piece in his hand, smiled and stretched, his mind came out of the chess game only to find that it was a bit cold, then walked into the house and lifted out his little sun.
<br><br>Subsequently, gently rested under the table.
<br><br>Old man Wu's eyes fiercely stared, and his body could not help but tremble a little.
<br><br>This is?
<br>Flame beads?
