The two generals of Feng Yun's scalp tingled, if they let these two lords continue, they would have to die violently on the spot.
<br><br>So the two of them hurriedly and urgently said, "No, it's really not like that."
<br><br>"Yes, yes, things have completely changed, and the target person we knocked down has not opened the seal of the barren land at all."
<br><br>Once the two voices fell.
<br><br>The atmosphere in the field instantly froze.
<br><br>The faces of the originally smiling World Exterminator and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch also instantly turned sullen.
<br><br>"What did you just say?"
<br><br>The Destruction Kingdom Monarch said in a hoarse voice, "You said that there was a change of heart and that the target hadn't unsealed the seal at all?"
<br><br>"Tell me quickly, what is going on?"
<br><br>The two Wind and Cloud Generals trembled in fear, but they had to stiffen their heads and say truthfully, "Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Lord Perdition, the target has indeed not unsealed the Desolate Land, as if the seal was not found at all."
<br><br>"What?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>When Destruction World and Genting Kingdom Monarch heard this, they also panicked at once.
<br><br>Exterminating World even grabbed the two of them and asked in a deep voice: "Then I ask you, where is he now, is he still in the barren land?"
<br><br>"No, no."
<br><br>The wind general said in cold sweat, "He has long since flown away."
<br><br>"Flew away?"
<br><br>The World Exterminator and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch were directly confused.
<br><br>"But it's not right!" At this time, Destruction quickly reacted again and said, "If this person did not unseal the Yellow Sky, how could the Qi Immortal Pillar have a foreshadowing?"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Genting king also instantly reacted, also surprised: "Yes, although the qi immortal pillar will also produce some small changes on their own, but the aura in front of you can definitely not be any small changes, can cause this kind of change, there must be a decision of the major qi things have changed."
<br><br>"Say, are you guys lying to me?"
<br><br>Just still full of smiles cloud top king, a hand will wind and cloud two general grabbed over, majestic power like a suction cup, sucked them in mid-air.
<br><br>"The king doesn't dare, it's not that we lied to you, but we haven't finished our words yet." The two generals of Feng Yun cried and said with difficulty.
<br><br>"Then you guys don't finish your farts at once?" The Genting kingdom ruler said with a face full of anger, and slapped the wind and cloud two generals over to the ground again.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Wind and cloud two generals tears are about to fall down.
<br><br>It is obvious that you two do not have the opportunity to say anything, so I do not have the opportunity to say anything.
<br><br>Of course, this kind of slander only dare to think in the heart, not dare to say out, so hurriedly will follow the things said: "Although the target did not break the seal directly away, but then Huang Tian climbed out from the seal itself."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>When these words fell, it directly set off a thousand waves.
<br><br>What's more, it made the Exterminator and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch's eyes widen, and the expressions on their faces changed extremely quickly.
<br><br>"Hahahahaha!"
<br><br>Until finally, the two looked at each other and suddenly burst out laughing.
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>"What a heavenly help!"
<br><br>The laughter of these two people made the two generals of Feng Yun confused again.
<br><br>These two lords, were they confused in their heads?
<br><br>Were they unable to understand the seriousness of the matter themselves?
<br><br>They hadn't finished speaking, and they were laughing again?
<br><br>Both of them looked urgent, wanting to hurry up and say what happened at the end in one breath as well.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Only when the two people opened their mouths, the ruler of the Genting Kingdom came over with a new face and gently lifted them up.
<br><br>"Aiya, two Aiqing ah, just now it was Zheng who misunderstood you."
<br><br>The Genting king said in a pleasant manner, "Although there was a change, but this change happened just as we wanted!"
<br><br>"After all, no matter how much we plan, that target person is distant from us, there will always be some karmic power involved."
<br><br>"But if Huang Tian broke the seal and ran out on his own, it would be completely different, the same as if we were not involved in any karma and achieved the same effect we wanted.
<br><br>"Hahahaha!"
<br><br>"So you two don't need to panic, Zheng ah still want to reward you heavily."
<br><br>"Yes, the king is right, this change is just what we want." Extinguisher's face is also a wave of a few turns, again into a smiling look, pick up the cavity, "so for you two meritorious officials, not only a heavy reward, is to be a big reward!"
<br><br>"Congratulations to the king, congratulations to the Lord of extinction."
<br><br>"A thousand generations of my Cloud Top Empire!"
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>The entire palace was filled with the color of joy, and countless experts in the imperial court knelt down and passed out warm congratulations.
<br><br>But the two Wind and Cloud Second Generals had tears in their eyes in a hurry.
<br><br>Congratulations to your sister ah!
<br><br>What the hell is in line with the heart.
<br><br>What the hell a thousand generations.
<br><br>Listen to the two of us first to finish the words ah!
<br><br>So the two people kneeled down and anxiously sent out their voices: "The king, the Lord of extinction, really not, please listen to my words first ......"
<br><br>But their words were once again interrupted by the Genting kingdom ruler.
<br><br>"Hush!"
<br><br>He raised his index finger and placed it by his mouth, and said softly: "The precursor of the qi immortal pillar has passed, and soon the big changes will start, my Genting Empire will also follow the Lord, and the qi will increase greatly, this epic moment, everyone silence me and shut up, observe well!"
<br><br>Said.
<br><br>He waved a big hand.
<br><br>A powerful force pervaded the entire palace, isolating all sound transmission.
<br><br>After doing all this.
<br><br>The Genting Kingdom Monarch and the Exterminator looked at each other, raised the corners of their mouths, and dropped their sharp gazes towards the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar.
<br><br>The other experts in the palace were also showing their anticipation.
<br><br>Together, they waited for the big change that was about to happen to the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar!
