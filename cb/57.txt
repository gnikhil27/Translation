Soon.
<br><br>With Ning Xuanwu as the leader, they soon arrived at the dark place not far from the door of the small martial arts school.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"A tiny mortal actually wasted my daddy's time for so long, let's see how I'll slap him into a meat cake." Ning Xuanwu said angrily.
<br><br>"Master, I think we'd better be careful for a second, it's best to ask for some proof if the information Xu Kun got is accurate before we say it?" Demon Ling'er frowned her pretty eyebrows and said with a worried face.
<br><br>"Humph."
<br><br>"A small mortal you actually told me to be careful?"
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu said angrily.
<br><br>"Master, I always feel as if there is still something abnormal, and you see ......" Demon Ling'er turned her sharp gaze towards the martial arts hall and said in a grave tone: "This martial arts hall is clearly under our surveillance, and he suddenly sat in front of this door with A few old men, don't you think it's fishy?"
<br><br>"Humph, this is just an oversight of your surveillance." Ning Xuanwu said disdainfully, "And mortals have many relatives, these few old men are just the kind of second grandfather, third uncle role."
<br><br>"In my eyes, regardless of whether he is the second eldest or the third uncle, mortals are just mortals, they are all like ants." One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Ning Xuanwu snorted angrily, feeling extremely obstructed by the existence of this martial arts school, his body aura revealed, his body dragged out a residual shadow in mid-air, carrying a huge might to envelop towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>In the blink of an eye, it arrived in the sky above the martial arts school.
<br><br>The four people who were sensing the martial intent on the martial word plaque, felt the aura fluctuations coming from above their heads and opened their eyes suddenly.
<br><br>Four Ling Li gaze, towards Ning Xuan Wu shot over.
<br><br>Who in the end, so bold dare to send an attack on this martial arts school, and what's more abominable, actually disturb them to feel the martial intent?
<br><br>However, the angry Ning Xuanwu directly ignored the four people's gaze.
<br><br>Four mortal old man, and this broken martial arts school all die out!
<br><br>"Gryphons, go to hell."
<br><br>Cold laugh, carrying a strong qi palm in mid-air a flip, a monstrous palm print followed cover down.
<br><br>This act directly stimulated Wu Yonghong's four people to rage, and the four people stood up fiercely, with a vast and profound Martial Sect aura erupting from the four people's bodies.
<br><br>With this aura impact alone, the entire sky instantly became oppressive.
<br><br>"Martial ......"
<br><br>"Martial Zong?"
<br><br>And is in mid-air Ning Xuan Wu felt these four strong qi, face suddenly changed greatly, speech are stuttered, eyes are about to burst out.
<br><br>These four sitting at the entrance of the martial arts school are actually four martial arts clans!
<br><br>He is a small Martial King, actually towards the four Martial Sects a slap, this is not a fucking head iron well?
<br><br>The next moment.
<br><br>The next moment, he seemed to have sensed something, his body cold sweat also rose up.
<br><br>The abacus, is the clan treasures heavenly opportunity plate?
<br><br>There is only one person who owns this treasure, and that is the life-threatening Abacus Li Mo Xie!
<br><br>And that unique costume covered with bones ......
<br><br>Also fiercely reminded Ning Xuanwu a character, a sentence out of the clan after the clan will be slaughtered, but also the clan's senior skulls polished into artifacts hanging on the body of the absolute madman, Chu Lion Mad.
<br><br>The other thin man, it seems to be that legendary Sun Zhuge who grew up with broken meridians, and then cultivated evil kung fu to change his life against the odds.
<br><br>The last one holding a rake head like a farmer ...... seems to be that Wu Yonghong who was cheated in a certain city, slaughtered the whole city in a fit of rage, and later silenced the relics.
<br><br>Recognized the identity of these people, Ning Xuanwu felt like he was about to cry.
<br><br>These four chaotic maniacs who had long ago silenced their voices and relics actually arrived at the entrance of this martial arts school at the same time, what the hell is going on here?
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>In front of these four, he a small Martial King, simply a brother, people famous when he Ning Xuanwu is still passing open crotch pants!
<br><br>Almost instantly, he was just bursting with energy, like an eggplant - absent-minded!
<br><br>He did not care that he suffered a backlash, forcibly withdrew his attack, not even daring to look at the four people, a roll in mid-air, and then pull out his legs and run!
<br><br>It must be said, Ning Xuanwu some series of movements, that is called a smooth, can be described as flowing water.
<br><br>He was sweating and stepping in the air, just wanting to escape from these four people as soon as possible.
<br><br>However, the next moment ......
<br><br>The next moment, he changed his face and felt a chill down his back.
<br><br>A let him not break free of the aura towards the spread of wrapped and came, will he locked in place out of thin air, and then pulled him back across the air.
