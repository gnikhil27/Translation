Lingxu Realm.
<br><br>Genting Empire.
<br><br>The large Imperial City Hall was currently filled with people.
<br><br>These people could be considered the pinnacle of the Lingxu Realm's battle force.
<br><br>Because the Genting Empire was the real giant in the Lingxu Realm, the rest of the empires were only its vassal states.
<br><br>As for the other sects in the Lingxu Realm, they also need to make annual contributions to the Cloud Top Empire.
<br><br>Among this group of peak experts, the leader is the dragon robed King of the Cloud Top Kingdom.
<br><br>Next to the Genting ruler, there is also a red-robed, red-haired man, it is the Chaos Hall in the world of extermination.
<br><br>With the change in the number of heavenly determinations, coupled with the original 234 people died and left, the matter of the Immortal River Chaos Monument naturally came to an end.
<br><br>Therefore, the world of extermination directly dispatched the few remaining people and came to the Cloud Top Empire.
<br><br>Just. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>At this moment, the world of extermination, and the king of the Cloud Top Empire, led the people to kneel on the ground respectfully.
<br><br>In the sky above their heads.
<br><br>A vortex appeared.
<br><br>Within the vortex, a face that could not be seen surfaced.
<br><br>"Greetings to the messenger."
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>Both the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch and the Exterminating World both emitted respectful voices.
<br><br>"Perish the world, although this time the Immortal River Chaos Tablet has changed, but the Lord does not blame you, the next time, only you and the Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch need to join hands, according to my guidance, plunder the Immortal River Continent Qi."
<br><br>A deep voice came from overhead, causing a shiver to run through Perdition's body.
<br><br>"Thank you, Lord, and thank you, Messenger."
<br><br>"I will definitely serve the Lord!"
<br><br>Exterminator said with a face full of gratitude.
<br><br>"En, Yun Ding, did you hear what I said?" The face turned its gaze to the king of Genting again.
<br><br>"My subordinate obeys the order, and will definitely cooperate well with Exterminating World to solve the Lord's problems!" The Genting Kingdom Monarch said with full respect.
<br><br>"En!"
<br><br>A satisfied voice came from that face.
<br><br>Under the black mist.
<br><br>A pillar of light descended into the great hall.
<br><br>"This is the Immortal Pillar of Qi Luck, representing the Qi Luck controlled by my lord in the Immortal River Continent, through the pillar you are able to observe the Qi Luck controlled by my lord in the Immortal River Continent at any time."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Extinction and Cloud Top Kingdom Monarch looked at each other.
<br><br>At once, they found that the foot-high Immortal Pillar of Qi Luck was already two-thirds filled with chaotic colors.
<br><br>They understood in their hearts.
<br><br>I'm afraid that this two-thirds of the controlled Qi luck is because of the Cloud Top Empire.
<br><br>After all, the Cloud Top Empire was the most powerful force in the entire Immortal River Continent including the Lingxu Realm, plus the countless vassal empires and sects under its control, it made sense that it would occupy two-thirds of the continent's Qi luck.
<br><br>"In addition, this is the guidance."
<br><br>Another stream of light descended, and a heavenly book carved with golden runes landed beside the two.
<br><br>"You only need to follow the things on the guide, and every thing you accomplish will increase the Qi luck that my Lord controls in the Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"Remember."
<br><br>"Make sure to make the qi pillar reach the realm of perfection, the Immortal River Continent was once the land of immortals after all, a realm on par with the Immortal Realm, and this realm's qi is of vital importance to our Lord."
<br><br>"Another point also need to remind you, do not be too open, it is best to lay a plan behind the scenes, lest the Lord bring too much karma, especially the killing karma, the last resort should not dip!"
<br><br>"Control qi luck, and grasp how to control!"
<br><br>The deep voice continued to come, word by word account of the two.
<br><br>"We obey the order."
<br><br>Genting king and extermination nodded their heads.
<br><br>Also understand the importance of cause and effect.
<br><br>Furthermore, qi luck was mysterious and not something that could be achieved by brute force.
<br><br>If not, unleashing the Genting Empire and exterminating the entire Immortal River Continent, wouldn't that put the entire Immortal River Continent's qi luck under control?
<br><br>But if this is the case, there will be thousands of karma entangled.
<br><br>On the contrary, the gains are not worth the losses.
<br><br>"Perish the world, you seem to have something to say?" At this time, the face inclined its head to look at the Exterminator and asked.
<br><br>"Messenger, I suspect that someone is behind this, especially the last Immortal River Chaos Tablet, so do you think you should ......"
<br><br>Exterminate asked cautiously.
<br><br>"The matter of the Immortal River Chaos Tablet has already passed, so you don't need to be too nagging, the Lord's matter, I'm afraid not many people dare to interfere yet."
<br><br>"Take a step back, even if someone is just a small nuisance, no need to put it on your mind."
<br><br>The voice from the black hole slowly said: "All you need to do is to fulfill what I just said."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The world of extinction nodded respectfully.
<br><br>The heart is also completely at ease.
<br><br>In retrospect, it was true.
<br><br>Even if there were people in the Immortal River Continent, it was not a big deal, could it be better than the Lord?
<br><br>The two are simply not a level of strength.
<br><br>At present, all you need to do is to follow the guidelines and do what the messenger has ordered.
<br><br>After the emissary left, the Genting king and the exterminator got up and looked at each other.
<br><br>"According to what the messenger's guidance said, the first thing to do is to release a Yellow Heavenly Giant Beast that was sealed several eras ago in the Immortal River Continent."
<br><br>"This beast has once been guided by the Lord, so it will definitely serve the Lord if it is released."
<br><br>"In addition, if it can recover after sealing, it has a battle power no less than you and I. Completing this task will enable the Qi Luck Immortal Pillar to grow significantly." Perish the world said.
<br><br>"That said, but it's not easy."
<br><br>Genting king frowned and said, "This beast is sealed by others, if we release him will be tainted with karma, and we represent the Lord, will not it be tainted with karma for the Lord?"
<br><br>"So we must lay out a layout so that someone who has nothing to do with us will release this beast."
<br><br>"This is indeed a difficult problem."
<br><br>Perishable frowned slightly and nodded likewise: "Plus the ancient seal, not very human can be solved, so this candidate, plus how to unlock the seal is also a big problem."
<br><br>The good thing is.
<br><br>Trouble is trouble, but the entire Genting Empire is controlled in the hands, after all.
<br><br>Want to set it all up behind the scenes, it is not impossible!
