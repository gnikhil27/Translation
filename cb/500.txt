"Grand Elder?"
<br><br>Burial Five blinked and froze, reacted and said breathlessly, "Are you teasing me, Fourth Brother, the Grand Elder of my Heaven and Earth Sect is able to destroy the Immortal River Continent with one punch, as for this Grand Master, he is a boat-holder and has not been able to enter my Heaven and Earth Sect yet."
<br><br>"Old Five how do you talk?"
<br><br>Burial four heard a sudden anxiety, said: "How can you how to say so this senior, in case the senior is angry ......"
<br><br>Just as his words fell, the old man next to him said with a smile, "Young man, he's right, the little old man I am a boat-holder!"
<br><br>"As for entering the Heaven and Earth Gate ......"
<br><br>He looked up at the mountain gate of the Heaven and Earth Gate in the distance and sighed, "That is my lifelong dream, but naive talent is not enough, so I can only be a dream in this life."
<br><br>"However, to be able to have the privilege of holding the boat here, is also already a great honor for my little old man!"
<br><br>"What, you really ......"
<br><br>Burial four incredulous, quickly pulled burial five again and asked, "Old five, you sure you're not lying to me?"
<br><br>"This one is able to jump three feet high under this gravity, at the very least he is a Xuan Xian level character, really just a boat propper?" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Aiya, you say fourth brother I lie to you for what, do not believe you look over there again." Burial Five said with a smile.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Burial four followed the direction of burial five to look, and immediately found that on top of the island, there is a group of old mothers gathered.
<br><br>With dynamic music, they were dancing neatly on the edge of the lake, bouncing and jumping around.
<br><br>Just in time.
<br><br>The music high ah tide came.
<br><br>Many big mothers collectively split a fork.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Burial four stared, just about lost his voice and screamed.
<br><br>Look at the group of ama's gaze, as if they saw what a great beauty, full of hot, full of unbelievable.
<br><br>To know.
<br><br>In the island under this kind of gravity, to do this group of aunt this kind of how difficult it should be.
<br><br>This is like an ordinary person, carrying a thousand pounds of heavy load continuous jumping also splits, and still can face not red heart not jump.
<br><br>What does this prove?
<br><br>Prove that this group of ama is also very strong, at least it must also be similar to the old man who is holding the boat in front of you.
<br><br>"She-she-she, they, this group of big moms, they are?"
<br><br>For a moment, he couldn't help but point to the trembling palms and ask out towards the burial five.
<br><br>"They are, in our Heaven and Earth Gate is just a group of ordinary amahs, occasionally will go to our Heaven and Earth Gate to pick up rags, help with odd jobs, so it's just, fourth brother does not need to be too surprised." Burial Five explained with a soft smile.
<br><br>"Picking up rags and doing odd jobs?"
<br><br>Burial four swallowed hard.
<br><br>For some reason, listening to Burial Five's words, he wanted to beat up this cute younger brother.
<br><br>That's too damn pretentious!
<br><br>But then he could hear that Burial Five was not exaggerating, but was seriously telling a fact.
<br><br>And the bemusement and disbelief on his face was not faked.
<br><br>This means that the old man who holds the boat or the old woman who dances is a common thing for him.
<br><br>"Old five, I want you to tell me, you really did not lie to me?" Burial Four looked solemnly at Burial Five, already with a huge change of heart from when he arrived, and asked word for word: "Heaven and Earth Gate, is it really as powerful as what I see before me?"
<br><br>"Of course not."
<br><br>Burying Five responded.
<br><br>"That's good."
<br><br>Burying Four patted his chest.
<br><br>It was really like what Burying Five said, that the Xuan Xian level characters were all just holding up the boat and doing odd jobs, then this Heaven and Earth Sect was indeed too terrifying.
<br><br>But yet.
<br><br>Burial five next cold sentence, let him petrified on the spot.
<br><br>"This grandparents where able to represent my Heaven and Earth Sect, what you see is only the mere maw of my Heaven and Earth Sect."
<br><br>"After all, which clan mopping up and propping up boats, can represent a clan anymore?"
<br><br>Burial Five had already taken the shocked Burial Four onto the island, while introducing the island's customs and people.
<br><br>"Look, that one is Pork Rong, that pig killing knife in his hand, I thought it was an intermediate level immortal weapon at first, but now I found out it's an advanced level immortal weapon, but it might actually be higher."
<br><br>Burial Five slowly introduced, "I was also shocked when I first arrived, but now I'm used to it, after all, there are too many things of this level on the island."
<br><br>Burial Four stared at the pig killing knife in Pork Rong's hand, his eyes were about to go straight.
<br><br>He had never seen anything so advanced in his life.
<br><br>"Look, that scale is also, and the walking stick in that old man's hand, and the hair band on that woman's head is also, too many, I won't count them all, you can see for yourself." Burial five said carelessly.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Burial four stared at the eyes.
<br><br>Sure enough, as Burial Five said, everything he saw in front of him was astonishing.
<br><br>"Look."
<br><br>Just when Burial Four was in shock and couldn't stop himself, Burial Five pulled him again.
<br><br>He hurriedly looked to the side.
<br><br>The stare was wide eyed.
<br><br>Only to see a man picking a pair of dung buckets, running raised are about to take off, busy that call.
<br><br>Burial four cold sweat.
<br><br>Has been this pick of dung to the shock of speech.
<br><br>Pick a pile of dung, a jump is two feet away, the blink of an eye has disappeared at the end of the street.
<br><br>This kind of toughness is not the group of dancing aunt and the old man holding the boat can be compared to.
<br><br>"How terrifying."
<br><br>He couldn't help but murmur out.
<br><br>"That's certainly."
<br><br>"This one is more than the grandparents, is considered our real Heaven and Earth Sect people, is my Heaven and Earth Sect's full-time dung picking ambassador, once also received my master's praise, such aspirational glory in the entire Heaven and Earth Sect is also rare, even when our brothers and teachers see it, they will politely shout out Ambassador Lu!"
<br><br>Burial Five faintly explained.
<br><br>"But Lu ambassador also does not represent my heaven and earth door, after all, my heaven and earth door hidden dragon crouching tiger, in addition to the master and many division brothers, there are also face value excellence four scum group, protect the mountain divine beast slowly God, do not serve on the dry Qing elders ......"
<br><br>"Of course, the backyard does not look right sweeping monk also seems to be very strong ......"
<br><br>"Brother, you do not say."
<br><br>Burial four directly gagged burial five, said with a face full of fervor: "Tell me, how can I join the Heaven and Earth Sect?"
<br><br>PS: work and rest chaos, yesterday a night without sleep, off the plane slept for two hours, in the Internet cafe knocked out a chapter, slow see baby.
