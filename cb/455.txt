"I was thinking, where do you get the face to say that?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an put his two legs together and said with narrowed eyes, "You're not to blame?"
<br><br>Wu Chang'an was directly amused.
<br><br>This hall of a big sect's patriarch, no brain?
<br><br>But it's true.
<br><br>No matter in the previous life or here, there are always some brain-dead people who are unbeatable, unable to recognize themselves and challenge authority.
<br><br>When things don't go as he imagined, he will always comfort himself and refuse to acknowledge the facts in front of him.
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi's face was ironic.
<br><br>"Then what do you want to do?"
<br><br>"Leave that woman behind." Wu Chang'an pointed at Bai Shanyi and said, "This woman has repeatedly cursed my master, her sin is unforgivable."
<br><br>"In addition, you have destroyed the painting and wooden carving that my junior sister Xiaodai gave to her parents, hand over all the treasures of your clan as compensation." First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>The faces of the people of Baiyang True Palace changed greatly.
<br><br>It's really a big lion's demand.
<br><br>"You don't want to bully people too much."
<br><br>Lu Zhengyi said in a hoarse voice: "Although these wooden sculptures are strong, but our Baiyang True Palace is not easy to mess with either.
<br><br>"Then you guys are asking for your own luck."
<br><br>Wu Chang'an smiled lightly, and did not nag, simply eyes narrowed, towards the recliner trip down.
<br><br>Also at the moment Wu Changan lay down, hundreds of wooden sculptures out of the characters as well as monsters, have stared at the Baiyang True Palace crowd.
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The faces of the Baiyang True Palace crowd were grave.
<br><br>"What should we do Sovereign?"
<br><br>The crowd turned their gazes to Lu Zhengyi.
<br><br>"Humph, bullying people too much, do you really think that my Bai Yang True Palace is easy to mess with?"
<br><br>Lv Zhengyi said with a sullen face, "Don't be afraid, these wooden sculptures look strong, but they are dead things after all, and they are only consumables, as long as we delay until they run out of energy, they are only fish meat on our chopping board."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>White Sun True Palace experts nodded solemnly.
<br><br>One after another, they drew out the weapons in their hands, lingering with an eerie glow and a chilling aura.
<br><br>"Kill!"
<br><br>Deafening shouts of killing came out from their mouths, actually killing towards the hundreds of wooden sculptures first.
<br><br>After all, they also knew that since they couldn't get away, they might as well attack first and strike the momentum.
<br><br>As they made their moves.
<br><br>A variety of knife techniques, palm techniques, energy shock waves mixed together spread, the entire sky deafening, a spatial rift directly tore open.
<br><br>And in the Baiyang True Palace experts action, hundreds of wooden sculptures also moved.
<br><br>Ten auspicious clouds black-robed men scattered in all directions, their floating bodies swept through the ruins, and while they swept, their palms were also madly forming seals.
<br><br>"Spicy Heavenly Race!"
<br><br>"Follow through, water cultivation ha."
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>A single skill was released from the hands of all ten people.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The sky was filled with black fog, and countless crows covered the open.
<br><br>On the ground, a large flood tilted in.
<br><br>The whole space, the power of water, fire and lightning intertwined.
<br><br>On the other side, dozens of giants stood up with a bang.
<br><br>Leaving a huge crater in the ground, while the palms crossed into a cross, the right hand in unison emitted a dazzling ray of destruction.
<br><br>In addition to this, other wooden sculptures also came out with various means, each showing its own magic.
<br><br>Instantly.
<br><br>The two sides battled together.
<br><br>The sky roared and the sound of blasting continued.
<br><br>Countless brutal breaths intertwined in the sky, turning into a wind blade, cutting through space.
<br><br>Berserk aura spread out from all directions, and the entire Baier City had turned into a human purgatory.
<br><br>An old man of Baiyang True Palace, alone facing a woman with an enchanting and exposed figure, suddenly revealed a cold smile.
<br><br>Such a delicate woman, what strength could she have?
<br><br>However, just as he made his move, a red love heart struck out from this woman's hand and landed on the old man's heart.
<br><br>"Uh ......"
<br><br>"What's going on?"
<br><br>The old man abruptly froze.
<br><br>The body, actually uncontrollably, went towards her?
<br><br>His eyes widened and he looked up at the woman.
<br><br>The woman, however, smiled at him, and a seductive voice came out leisurely.
<br><br>"Daji accompany you to play."
<br><br>As soon as the voice fell, the woman flashed to his side, and at the same time a mysterious force fell into the old man's body.
<br><br>The old man's body stiffened and fell to the ground with an incredulous face.
<br><br>On the other side.
<br><br>A middle-aged man of the Heavenly Immortals swept up with his sword, dragging out a long blade light.
<br><br>However, he was just about to slash out when a sturdy man jumped overhead.
<br><br>"Demacia."
<br><br>A large treasure sword was stuck above the man's head.
<br><br>Man.
<br><br>Pawn!
<br><br>In the ruins.
<br><br>The three elders met the exploding-headed yellow hair that had blown up the flying boat earlier.
<br><br>"This man is not weak, let's move directly to kill him, sacrifice the divine talisman of the clan, sacrifice the doppelganger to use the advantage of numbers to deal with him."
<br><br>An old man said.
<br><br>As his figure fell, the three of them simultaneously drew out ten golden talismans.
<br><br>Under the flickering light of the talisman papers, each person manifested ten doppelgangers.
<br><br>"Although the divine talisman only lasts for a moment, each of the doppelgangers has our own strength, thirty of us is enough to crush this yellow hair."
<br><br>The old man at the head of the group shouted, "Let's go!"
<br><br>Thirty bodies attacked out towards Huang Mao from all directions.
<br><br>But in the face of their siege, Huang Mao formed hand seals in place.
<br><br>"Multiple, the art of shadow splitting."
<br><br>As soon as his hand seals fell, a burst of white smoke emerged from the surroundings, and then one by one Yellow Hair jumped out from the white smoke, there were thousands of them.
<br><br>"Gah!"
<br><br>The three old men were directly dumbfounded.
