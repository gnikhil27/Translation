 "Yes, yes, yes, even if the lady wants to like, she will like the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber and the Supreme Treasure, she will not like this kind of mortal." Mao Mao said meaningfully with a mischievous look.
<br><br>"Shut up." The woman knocked Mao Mao's little head, while her pretty face said worriedly again, "But do you think that he will also be a mortal?"
<br><br>"Well ......" Mao Mao bored little head thinking: "I think it should not be, you see that the Supreme Treasure inside the character although and our cultivation is not the same, is not also very powerful, even if you want to make up, itself must also There is a certain understanding of cultivation, in order to write this kind of book, right?"
<br><br>"Right."
<br><br>The woman gave an appreciative glance at Mao Mao, she also thought so, a simple romance novel, perhaps really may be written by mortals, but the Supreme Treasure is also a world of cultivation ah, the characters in it is often a hundred thousand miles, more top treasures such as the Moonlight Box, such a world, with the eyes of mortals and how to write out?
<br><br>"Then Mao Mao, from today onwards, you help me search for this gentleman with all your might, I want to see him in the fastest possible time." The woman explained in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Good, good, miss, know your mind, I will immediately send a message out." Mao Mao covered her mouth and laughed lightly, before retreating.
<br><br>In the room.
<br><br>Yi Feng changed his clothes and wiped them down before he felt quite comfortable.
<br><br>Subsequently, and grabbed a rabbit from inside the bamboo basket, came to the open space in front of the house. Rushing a day's journey oil and water did not enter, now settle down, say what also want to treat themselves well.
<br><br>Immediately, they set up a barbecue.
<br><br>Soon, a fragrant rabbit was grilled out by Yi Feng, greasy but not greasy, especially after Yi Feng sprinkled with seasoning, but also emitting a tempting fragrance.
<br><br>"Mmm, fragrant!"
<br><br>Smell, Yi Feng is not in a hurry to eat, after all, just baked things to eat especially easy to fire, but again the ground dug a small pit, from the bamboo basket inside the pheasant has been wrapped in lotus leaves, buried in.
<br><br>Then, forked up a grilled fish.
<br><br>Not much time, the roast fish has been cooked, the fish skin baked crispy, looks full of appetite.
<br><br>Called chicken also similarly out of the ground, the fragrance is overflowing.
<br><br>Although he is only a mortal, but treat his life Yi Feng is never ambiguous, even if you can not eat all, but always eat a good.
<br><br>"And a pot of good wine, simply beautiful."
<br><br>Yi Feng will also take out the wine gourd, everything is done, Yi Feng only satisfied clapped his hands.
<br><br>A chicken leg, a mouthful of wine down, Yi Feng is satisfied.
<br><br>Although it is late autumn, but there are still a lot of small animals inside the mountain, there is a burst of chirping like cicadas, and there are many moths come to the fire.
<br><br>Yi Feng looked up.
<br><br>The moon is high, the white moon in the sky, a few mouthfuls of wine down, although not drunk, but also a little bit of alcohol.
<br><br>In the heart, it is actually remembered the hometown of the previous life.
<br><br>The long-lost high-rise summer, the city's traffic, forgetting the King's Glory and League of Legends, and his family, the former life of his brothers and friends ......
<br><br>"Raise your head to look at the moon, head down to think of the hometown ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised his cup to invite the moon, his eyes are actually at some point filled with mist.
<br><br>"Gongzi not only good poetry, it seems to be a person with a story." Outside the courtyard, two silhouettes appeared and sent out a voice, also when the voice fell, the woman hid in the eyes of the coldness also quietly dispersed.
<br><br>In fact, the two have been observing for a long time.
<br><br>Shogun Mountain here, the matter is important.
<br><br>On the surface, the two women love the clean, play in the mountains, secretly they are stationed here, to eliminate all accidents.
<br><br>For two years, never into a living person, Yi Feng a living person, making such a big noise, even if he is only a mortal, but also has attracted the attention of the two women.
<br><br>But now it seems that it is the two of her overthinking.
<br><br>"So it's the two girls, I'm sorry."
<br><br>Yi Feng was busy making a bow, while inviting the two women into the fire, apologizing, "It's only good that I didn't disturb you two, I was going to sort out this food and send it to you two, but since I'm here, why don't we eat some together?"
<br><br>The woman in white glanced at Yi Feng.
<br><br>For some reason, to this mortal youth, actually some different feelings, originally not interested in these mundane grains and so on, she actually ghost to sit down.
