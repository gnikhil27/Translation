And at this moment, Ye Tianzhi, but already about to cry.
<br><br>Just now he was ready to make a move, but what did he see?
<br><br>Li Shuhua, Yang Tianyu, Xue Qinzhu, Yun Haotian, and so on a group of Nan Sha's super big shots, in addition to that, there was also his Snow Blowing Villa's Villa Master Fifth Tianming and Young Master Fifth Changkong.
<br><br>Of course, the most frightening to him was the youth in the caravan and that black robe.
<br><br>He was fortunate enough to rush over to the edge of the South Sand that day, but witnessed with his own eyes how that black robe killed the Demon Emperor level demon beast.
<br><br>Also witnessed how that youth was leisurely sleeping under the demon emperor level battle.
<br><br>He knows exactly what this group of people are!
<br><br>Asking him, a small Martial King, to ambush them, this is not a fucking shit-shell boy moving a big mountain - self-important?
<br><br>Despite not knowing why he came across this group of people, but at this moment he only has one belief.
<br><br>Run.
<br><br>In this group of big brother did not find him, run as far as possible the better. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"This ...... this this, what the hell is going on here?"
<br><br>And left behind Ye Wuchen is equally difficult, his brother said he would help him take revenge, but for good reason how come he ran away?
<br><br>"Then I, then what should I do?"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen looked anxious, circling around for a long time, also ready to cry and leave, after all, there are martial spirit experts in this group of people ah.
<br><br>But just as he turned his head, he came face to face with a face that sent chills straight up his spine.
<br><br>"Aba Aba."
<br><br>The voice came, Ye Wuchen's mouth immediately let out a scream, the pain he had just tasted yesterday was experienced together again, the sourness went straight to his brain, making his whole face turn distorted.
<br><br>What made him even more desperate was that the black-robed man also stripped him of his clothes and hung him from the tree.
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"What the hell is wrong with this!"
<br><br>Ye Wuchen cried and wailed, emitting a wailing voice.
<br><br>I thought it was his time to take revenge, but I never thought it would turn out like this ......
<br><br>At this time.
<br><br>In the clouds high in the sky.
<br><br>There were two figures standing, looking through the clouds at the scene happening below.
<br><br>The leader is a woman, she is a long black skirt windless, face cold, standing in the air and emitting a unique aura, giving people a kind of high above the model.
<br><br>Another person is an old man, dressed in a Taoist robe, seemingly old eyes but with a color of insight into the sky.
<br><br>"These people from Nansha are really ridiculous, how to look at it is only a mortal, but hard to brainstorm this person as some kind of supreme expert!"
<br><br>The woman said with a slightly teasing look in the corner of her eyes, expressionlessly: "I don't know what kind of compelling language that youth used, actually made this group of people hard to believe in, there are also two Second Life Martial Emperors, really slippery world ......"
<br><br>"A group of foolish people just, it is not necessary to care about them."
<br><br>The old man laughed, obviously not putting this group of people in his eyes.
<br><br>"However, is that boy really of the God bloodline?"
<br><br>The woman asked again, her sharp gaze locked on Zhong Qing's body through the clouds.
<br><br>"According to the calculations I borrowed from the celestial signs, the God bloodline does appear in this part of Nansha, and after our observation during this period of time, I'm afraid that this boy is fifty percent true."
<br><br>The old man said with a slightly excited expression, "This is the first God bloodline to appear in two million years, ah, his appearance, for us, especially for you, is not trivial ah!"
<br><br>The woman frowned slightly and asked in a deep voice: "Only fifty percent, and can not be completely sure?"
<br><br>"Gods bloodline, can calculate fifty percent, has consumed my life's work." The old man said with a bitter smile.
<br><br>"Then, there is no other way to activate my physique?" The woman asked again.
<br><br>"No."
<br><br>The old man shook his head: "The method of dual cultivation is the only way to activate your bloodline!"
<br><br>The woman rubbed her brow.
<br><br>She had the body of a divine phoenix, but she was bitterly unable to activate it.
<br><br>Originally, this bloodline, which was just as rare as the divine bloodline, was not something she had any hope of activating.
<br><br>But now they are in a situation where there is no other way but to activate the bloodline in her body to turn around.
<br><br>But the conditions for activating the divine phoenix bloodline are extremely demanding, that is, you have to double-cultivate with the divine bloodline to obtain, but it is not easy to find a divine bloodline, but still can not be fully confirmed.
<br><br>If it turns out that the other party is not of the divine bloodline, she would have lost her wife and lost her army?
<br><br>"In other words, I must be completely confirmed before I can act?" The woman asked.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>The old man responded, hesitating for a moment before adding, "Of course you can also take risks."
<br><br>The woman shook her head.
<br><br>This kind of risk was not something she dared to take.
<br><br>"Then how can I confirm it?" The woman asked again.
<br><br>"There is only one way, get close to him, you are of the same ancient bloodline, when you stay together, you might be able to cause some bloodline reaction." The old man said.
<br><br>"That's fine, I'll just go and capture him."
<br><br>The woman said in a cold voice and was about to make her move.
<br><br>"Wait."
<br><br>The old man hurriedly blocked: "I am talking about dual cultivation, not simply physical, if the other party's will is not strong enough, you can not activate the divine phoenix bloodline, only the extreme will of both parties to cause resonance can."
<br><br>"So, if you make the boy feel bad about you and resist you, even if you confirm that he is of the divine bloodline, you will not necessarily be able to activate your bloodline if you forcefully double cultivation with him."
<br><br>The woman withdrew her hand, and her brow furrowed once again.
<br><br>In other words, not only did she have to approach the other party, she also had to please him as much as possible?
<br><br>"So, it may be necessary to condescend to you, find an identity to approach them, as far as possible not to arouse the boy's ill feelings at the same time, to confirm whether the boy is a god bloodline or not!" The old man said again.
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>The woman's face instantly revealed a look of disgust.
<br><br>That is to say, she also needs to be like those foolish palmistas in Nansha, cooperating with the acting to be a brainiac?
