"Doggie, go!"
<br><br>Come inside the mountain, Yi Feng directly put the dog in the ring released.
<br><br>After all, hunting well.
<br><br>With a dog is still very necessary!
<br><br>And this journey is also considered to have a companion.
<br><br>"Woof woof woof!"
<br><br>With the dog's bark, one person and one dog deep into the Shade Mountain Range.
<br><br>The sky.
<br><br>A human figure flew by.
<br><br>It was a charming silhouette.
<br><br>Her figure is tall, bare feet in the air, dressed differently from the norm, beautiful to the extreme. The first domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>But her beauty is not the kind of small family beauty, but the kind of wild and unrestrained beauty, this appearance gives people a different kind of attractive h sense.
<br><br>"I really didn't expect that inside this little pimple in Dongsheng, a Heaven-devouring Demon Wolf with its own heaven and earth vision was actually born."
<br><br>"Since I'm here this time, I must take this little wolf away!"
<br><br>There was a glint in her eyes.
<br><br>The mind was thinking about something important.
<br><br>"Hm?"
<br><br>"This is?"
<br><br>Suddenly, her eyes picked up a different aura that she sensed not far away in the mountain.
<br><br>Even though this aura was not released on its own, she still felt it as a demonic beast essence.
<br><br>"This demonic beast's aura is a bit special, I actually can't tell what kind of demonic beast it actually is!"
<br><br>"It's rather strange, I'd like to see what it really is."
<br><br>Slightly hesitant, she then turned around and swept out.
<br><br>She also wanted to check it out.
<br><br>"Woof woof woof!"
<br><br>The dog barked.
<br><br>Seems to be something found.
<br><br>Yi Feng took the bow and arrow and hurriedly followed, and saw a white skeleton lying in the weeds in front.
<br><br>And the dog's target, it is this one skeleton.
<br><br>"Small sample, can ah!"
<br><br>Yi Feng couldn't help but jerk the dog's head, then dropped his gaze on the skeleton.
<br><br>The skeleton itself was no big deal, but the ring that he carried on his white palm bone was particularly conspicuous.
<br><br>Storage ring.
<br><br>Yi Feng knew this thing.
<br><br>And in this world, can have a storage ring, either rich or noble, or is a cultivator.
<br><br>Yi Feng peeled off that storage ring.
<br><br>"Let's guess what good treasures are inside!"
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a smile, full of expectation.
<br><br>"Woof woof woof!"
<br><br>The dog barked a few times in response to Yi Feng, and after barking, glanced meaningfully in a certain direction.
<br><br>But seeing that Yi Feng seemed to be completely unconcerned about that direction, he didn't care either.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>"This look, is it finding me out?"
<br><br>Far away in the dark, the woman raised her eyebrows slightly, remembering that gaze of the dog just now, she always felt that it meant a lot.
<br><br>But soon, she shook her head again.
<br><br>"It should be that I am overthinking, how could they have found me, it should just be a coincidence."
<br><br>"Just let me still do not quite understand, this dog demon is obviously in the form of a dog demon, but there is no half of the dog demon's breath, really strange!"
<br><br>"But this is not important, what is important is that it, as a demonic beast, would actually stoop to follow the side of a human?"
<br><br>Thinking about this.
<br><br>She furrowed her brow.
<br><br>Hardly.
<br><br>Was it being controlled?
<br><br>The more she thought about it, the more she thought that was the possibility.
<br><br>Because demonic beasts and humans have always been at odds, so demonic beasts simply will not be with humans.
<br><br>Therefore.
<br><br>This guess is not far off.
<br><br>Unbidden, anger rose in her eyes.
<br><br>"A tiny human, I don't care what method you used to control this dog demon, but if you dare to treat my demon beast lineage like this, then the only way to pay for it is with your life."
<br><br>Her body demonic energy began to slowly rise up.
<br><br>In her heart, she also intended to solve this human and free the dog demon.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Just when the woman was ready to wield her hand to exterminate Yi Feng, Yi Feng, who was not far away, also opened his storage ring.
<br><br>The eyes looked at it, and it was brilliant gold.
<br><br>"Gold coins."
<br><br>"Damn it is gold coins, there are tens of thousands of them."
<br><br>"A big profit!"
<br><br>"Hahaha."
<br><br>These tens of thousands of gold coins were definitely a windfall for Yi Feng at this period of time, which made him extremely happy.
<br><br>"Oh yeah!"
<br><br>With happiness, he couldn't help but clench his fist and "oh yeah" towards the sky!
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>The woman who was closing in on Yi Feng suddenly gave a speed bump in mid-air and raised her head to look high into the sky.
<br><br>"This punch."
<br><br>"This punch is ......"
<br><br>She stared with a jealous eye, her mouth shivered, and her body couldn't help but tremble.
<br><br>Because this punch.
<br><br>She was too familiar with it.
<br><br>But wasn't it the same punch that suddenly appeared in the sky some time ago?
<br><br>At this moment.
<br><br>Countless old monsters of the Immortal River Continent, after having appeared some time ago, had once again come out in unison, their gazes also staring deadly at the high sky.
<br><br>"That punch."
<br><br>"It's appeared again."
<br><br>"This level of attack, is it really struck by a human?"
<br><br>"The immortal path has been broken, how could someone send out an attack of this level, could this be due to some kind of heaven and earth vision?"
<br><br>Immortal Realm.
<br><br>Countless immortal world bigwigs gathered.
<br><br>"That punch, it's appeared again." Someone said with a gloomy face.
<br><br>"Yes, this punch, even stronger than the last one, overlapped with the location of the last one, causing a hundred thousand miles to turn into chaos and the center ten thousand miles to turn directly into nothingness." Another person said.
<br><br>As soon as these words fell, a strong sense of crisis surged on everyone's face.
<br><br>This punch.
<br><br>Was it a warning from some kind of existence.
<br><br>Or was it the harbinger of some unknown realm that was about to attack the Immortal Realm?
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>Everyone is in danger.
<br><br>Because often this kind of impervious to touch, and can not find the source of the unknown things, is the most people feel the most fear.
<br><br>And in the Makufu Mountain Range.
<br><br>The woman who witnessed this punch with her own eyes had long since turned into a yellow leopard, prostrated on the ground, her whole body almost cowering inside the mud, not daring to move.
<br><br>She never thought that she would be fortunate enough to witness this punch, how it was struck.
<br><br>What was even more ridiculous was that she actually tried to attack the other party, all unaware that the other party was such an existence.
<br><br>And she finally understood why that dog demon would willingly follow this person's side.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>She would be willing to do it even if she was left alone.
<br><br>However, despite all the thoughts in her head, the fear that filled her heart was the one that could not dissipate.
<br><br>Because this inexplicable punch.
<br><br>It was more like she was attacking the One, and the One was warning her.
<br><br>The more she thought about it.
<br><br>The more terrified she was in her heart.
<br><br>If he really got angry, I'm afraid ten of her would not be enough to die.
<br><br>However, what made her feel relieved was that Yi Feng didn't take care of her, but quickly left.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>"It's too scary!"
<br><br>"I'd better hurry to the Heaven Devouring Demon Wolf Clan and take that little wolf and hurry out of this place!"
<br><br>She lifted her head after the robbery.
<br><br>Then shifted direction and rushed towards the Sky Devouring Demon Wolf Clan.
