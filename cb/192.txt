Green Mountain Gate.
<br><br>Wind and Cloud Valley's Yun Xian Que descended with Lin Bo.
<br><br>After all, Feng Yun Valley was a big power in the whole South China Sea.
<br><br>In comparison, his Qingshan Sect was a small sect in a remote mountain village.
<br><br>Just entered the door.
<br><br>The Lin Bo, who was following Yun Xian Que, intentionally or unintentionally leaked a breath.
<br><br>This is also considered to be the usual style of action of the big sects, sometimes take the strength to speak to save lip service more.
<br><br>Sure enough, Lin Bo aura reveal, green mountain door of the senior face immediately held ugly, apparently all suffered a small pressure.
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>This Lin Bo, is a martial dwelling expert.
<br><br>However, Lu Qingshan's calmness made Lin Bo's face sink slightly. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>A small sect's ancestor, facing his oppressive pressure actually did not react?
<br><br>Can't help but, his breath heaved a few points, and even turned his gun towards Lu Qingshan's direct intimidation.
<br><br>But Lu Qingshan's condition, once again exceeded his expectations.
<br><br>This.
<br><br>How is it possible?
<br><br>He is a martial dweller, why is his pressure ineffective against him?
<br><br>Feeling the pressure coming from Lin Bo, Lu Qingshan couldn't help but smile coldly in his heart.
<br><br>Perhaps in the past, when he saw a martial dweller, he would still tremble and not know what to do.
<br><br>But this time is different.
<br><br>Now in front of him, so what if he is a martial artist.
<br><br>Did he really think that he was a turtle and had never seen a Martial Dignity?
<br><br>"Elder Lin doesn't have to be so polite, right? You want to give me a big gift as soon as you come? Although my Qingshan Sect is only a small sect, but I, Lu Qingshan, am only one foot short of you!" Lu Qingshan said leisurely.
<br><br>At the same time the body cultivation also exploded out.
<br><br>"Half ......"
<br><br>"Half Zun?"
<br><br>Lin Bo's face was full of incredulity, only then did he realize that Lu Qingshan was actually at the half-exalted realm, while Yun Xian Que on the side also opened her red lips slightly, filled with shock.
<br><br>When did an ancestor from a remote area have a half-exalted cultivation level?
<br><br>In their opinion, having the cultivation level of a Martial Emperor was even very good.
<br><br>Obviously, this was far beyond their expectations.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan with a faint smile, really think that he often accompany the sir around is posing to see?
<br><br>His talent is poor, but under the kind of Mr. smashing to general chance, even a pig can pile up.
<br><br>So he Lu Qingshan is a half-esteem, is in the normal.
<br><br>"I really didn't expect that Old Ancestor Qingshan was actually a half-esteem cultivator, it's my fault for being abrupt." Yun Xian Que did not move to put away the shock on his face and turned towards Old Ancestor Qingshan with a smile, "Please also forgive me, Uncle Lin meant nothing."
<br><br>Obviously.
<br><br>A half-exalted book was enough to make Yun Xian Que treat it this way.
<br><br>"Miss Yun is polite, naturally the old man will not take it to heart, please sit down." Old Ancestor Qing Shan reached out his hand to gesture.
<br><br>After the two people took their seats, they did not ambiguity, after a slight pause Yun Xian Que then opened the door and said, "Old Ancestor Qing Shan, the reason for coming here must be clear to you, how about, our two doors cooperate, with the cultivation of Lin Bo plus your cultivation, in addition to the convenience of the Qing Shan door as a local, the chances of us taking this cave can be much greater than others. "
<br><br>"Heh."
<br><br>The old ancestor of Castle Peak picked up the tea cup next to him and moved the lid lightly with his palm clamped, laughing leisurely, "Miss Yun, sorry, my Castle Peak Sect is not involved in this matter."
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que smiled, put the teacup in her hand and stood up fiercely.
<br><br>Those sharp eyes looked straight at Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>"Old Ancestor Qingshan, in that case, you are already cooperating with other powers?" Yun Xian Que asked with narrowed eyes.
<br><br>"No, Miss Yun you misunderstood, we don't cooperate with any forces." Old Ancestor Qing Shan said bluntly.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's beautiful eyes narrowed once again.
<br><br>After observing Old Ancestor Qing Shan for a long time, she suddenly raised her red lips and smiled, "So that's how it is, I understand ......"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan's gaze moved slightly and looked at Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>Then, Yun Xian Que's voice came leisurely, "How about this, I can make the decision, as long as your Qingshan Sect cooperates with my Feng Yun Valley, after the matter is completed, you can share 30% of the benefits of your Qingshan Sect, what do you think?"
<br><br>Old Ancestor Qing Shan shook his head with a bitter smile and explained, "Miss Yun, it's not a matter of profit sharing."
<br><br>However, Yun Xian Que frowned and asked in a deep voice, "You still don't agree?"
<br><br>"It's really not a profit issue." Old Ancestor Qing Shan continued.
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's face turned cold.
<br><br>The eyes then looked at Lin Bo.
<br><br>Obviously, in this matter, having the help of the Castle Peak Sect could make it quite convenient for them to get the treasure more easily, not to mention the battle power of the Castle Peak Old Ancestor Half Dignity.
<br><br>She was asking if Lin Bo could make another concession.
<br><br>Lin Bo pondered slightly and nodded towards her.
<br><br>Seeing this, only then did Yun Xian Que clenched her teeth and said, "In this way, I will take it upon myself to give you Castle Peak Sect 40% of the profits again, you must understand that there are definitely countless benefits from the Martial Saint Cave, with this 40% of the profits, it is enough for your entire Castle Peak Sect to soar, and you can even have a place in the entire South Sand."
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Lu Qingshan's attitude was once again out of her expectation.
<br><br>Once again, he refused her!
<br><br>"Bang!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's face was cold, her palm fell next to the wooden table into crushing, looking deadly at Lu Qingshan asked word by word: "Old Ancestor Qingshan, I suggest you know what you want, could it be that you, a small Qingshan Sect, still want fifty percent?"
<br><br>"Miss Yun, as I said, you misunderstood."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan face also turned slightly nonchalant, stood up and said in a deep voice: "As I said, it is not a matter of profit, but my Qingshan Sect does not participate in this matter, even if you give me ten percent of the profit, we will not get involved."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que said with a cold face, "You think this through? This is the Martial Saint's cave."
<br><br>Lu Qingshan smiled and nodded his head.
<br><br>"Fine, fine."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was obviously furious and got up and wanted to take Lin Bo away.
<br><br>"Wait for Miss Yun."
<br><br>Looking at the backs of the two leaving, Old Ancestor Qingshan pondered slightly and said, "Although we had a bad time today, but Wind and Cloud Valley used to take care of my clan, so there is a piece of advice I want to tell you."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que turned to look at Lu Qingshan.
<br><br>"It's best that you guys don't dip into this messy water either."
<br><br>What Yi Feng said echoed in Lu Qingshan's mind, and a solemn voice was transmitted towards the two.
<br><br>"Oh, according to you, are you asking us to give up this treasure directly to the Blowing Snow Villa and the Heavenly Sword Sect?"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que's pretty face was filled with frost as she snorted disdainfully.
<br><br>"Alarming words!"
<br><br>Saying that, the two continued to sweep away into the air.
