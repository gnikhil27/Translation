"Wastes!"
<br><br>"A bunch of trash, can't even handle such a little thing, what's the use of me raising you?"
<br><br>In the great hall of the Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, Mao Lin looked at the few men kneeling under his hands, and while his palm fell towards the table, a violent voice came out of his mouth.
<br><br>During this period of time, he had been under great pressure.
<br><br>Especially after the defeat of his daughter personally, but also facing the opposition of the entire Chamber of Commerce senior.
<br><br>There was no way out, so he came up with such a solution.
<br><br>Since Yi Feng could not work for his Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce, then directly destroy, so that can also help Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce out of trouble.
<br><br>However, he never expected that he could not come up with such a ploy easily, but it did not work at all.
<br><br>"The president redeems himself." The leader's men knocked their heads on the ground and explained with respectful faces, "We didn't know that Yi Feng didn't come, it was his disciple who came!"
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>Mao Lin coldly snorted, "Since you guys later knew that it wasn't Yi Feng, why did you still make a move to alarm the snake, after this made Yi Feng get defensive, wouldn't it kill the chance to make a move on him next time?" One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>"This ...... we see that it is not Yi Feng are indeed ready to call it a day." The leader of the men said with an ugly face: "But, after that disciple of his saw that our target was Yi Feng, he himself took the lead in striking at us, and this little bastard is not badly equipped, and killed several of our brothers with his bare hands before he was killed."
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"You guys just know how to find excuses."
<br><br>Mao Lin could not rest in anger, this time did not kill Yi Feng, next time to find the opportunity, I'm afraid it will not be so easy.
<br><br>"Forget it father, let's bypass them!"
<br><br>At this time, a young man dressed in fancy clothes walked in with a faint smile on his face, the visitor was Mao Lin's son, Mao Yun'er's elder brother Mao Yi.
<br><br>"Yi'er, what time is it now, why are you still so relaxed?" Mao Lin broke with a reproachful look at Mao Yi, said in a serious tone: "Do you not know that I do these things, even at the expense of your sister, are for you, if I am down this president, you want to ascend to this position in the future, I'm afraid it is more difficult than ascending to the sky!"
<br><br>"Father you misunderstood." Mao Yi said with a smile, "Father's mind I certainly know, just you blame them also useless, and, is not a small Yi Feng, can write two books and so, what is the big deal, to kill him is not easy!"
<br><br>"But Yi'er, from what Yun'er said, this Yi Feng is not as simple as it seems!"
<br><br>Mao Lin said in a serious tone: "I heard that there are also cultivators close to him, and his relationship with the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce is not trivial ah, you must understand, the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce blatantly steal our business we do not dare to make a move against them, because Yin Xiong's baby daughter in the Castle Peak Gate ah!"
<br><br>"That has nothing."
<br><br>Mao Yi sneered: "Even if he is not simple, he is at most a low-level cultivator, and as for him and the Baofeng Chamber of Commerce, it is only a relationship of interest!"
<br><br>"But even if he's a low-level cultivator, he's still a cultivator at least!" Mao Lin still said with concern.
<br><br>"Father, you are at least the president of the Chamber of Commerce, high profound cultivators are indeed out of our reach, but cultivators who can deal with Yi Feng, we don't necessarily can't afford to hire ah!"
<br><br>Mao Yi laughed meaningfully.
<br><br>The voice just fell, from the door came in three men, three people with a profound aura, with a murderous aura, as soon as they walked in gave Mao Lin a lot of pressure.
<br><br>"This ...... these three are ......"
<br><br>Mao Lin stared and said.
<br><br>"These three are the cultivators I invited, they will help us directly solve Yi Feng, and their cultivation level, is already to Martial Spirit!" Mao Yi said leisurely.
<br><br>"Martial Spirit!"
<br><br>At those words, Mao Lin's heart thudded.
<br><br>Never thought that these three people were actually Martial Spirits, this was a character that he usually couldn't even come into contact with.
<br><br>"So say father, just put a million hearts into it!" Mao Yi said with a smile on his face, "With three Martial Spirit experts, a little Yi Feng, even if he has a little cultivation, he is still not the one to be crushed to death?"
<br><br>"But ......"
<br><br>Mao Lin came closer to Mao Yi and asked softly, "To invite these three, it should have cost a lot, right?"
<br><br>"Father, you can rest assured, we mortals and other treasures they do not see ......" said Mao Yi, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, said: "They only need me to help them find a hundred wonderful women! "
<br><br>"A hundred wonderful women?"
<br><br>Mao Lin was overjoyed.
<br><br>If that was the case, it seemed that this deal was a blood money for their father and son!
<br><br>And with three Martial Spirits out there, there would definitely be no problem killing Yi Feng.
<br><br>So Mao Lin smiled and said towards the three, "Three lords, as long as you help us take care of this matter, I will help you find two hundred wonderful women, not to mention a hundred."
<br><br>"Very good!"
<br><br>The three sat down on their asses, listened to Mao Lin's words, nodded in satisfaction, raised the corners of their mouths and sneered: "After we rest for a day, the little bastard you are talking about will be left to us."
<br><br>PS: I'm a little late today, there are two more chapters.
