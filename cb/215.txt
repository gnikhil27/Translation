"Here you go."
<br><br>Yi Feng poured the spicy bar on the ground, stroked the dog's dog head and laughed.
<br><br>The dog gobbled up the food, and then ran away from the shadow.
<br><br>Looking at the many spicy strips just poured on the ground, the dog ate, the hearts of the people dripping blood, should have known just not polite to eat two more ah!
<br><br>At this time, Yi Feng looked at the people sitting, then remembered the purpose of this group of people, can not help but pinch the nose embarrassed smile: "you guys to lift my name to come, I should have played a few songs to everyone to express gratitude, but unfortunately, the piano broke a few strings, so no way sorry!"
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>Several people immediately revealed a look of loss.
<br><br>Although most of the people in the field, in addition to the book, qin and painting, most of them are not cultivated by the qin, but this one painting a word contains a powerful mood and martial intent, if you can listen to this one song, I'm afraid you can also get a lot of benefits ah!
<br><br>Now it seems, I'm afraid there is no such chance.
<br><br>No!
<br><br>But the crowd instantly reacted again, this matter is not so simple. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>Because this store just about anything is a treasure, so how could this one's strings break?
<br><br>It is.
<br><br>They rushed in in a flurry, thinking only of how to get a chance on this one, even after having already eaten the chili fries, observed the calligraphy and painting and other chances, without the slightest indication of themselves.
<br><br>This has obviously caused this person's displeasure.
<br><br>And just now the spicy strips directly poured to the dog to eat, I'm afraid it is also this reason.
<br><br>After reacting, Shu Qinhua hurriedly bowed and said, "Sir, it just so happens that I still have a Heavenly Toad Silk there, if you need it, I will send it over as fast as possible."
<br><br>"Damn it!"
<br><br>"Preempted by this woman!"
<br><br>Seeing that Shu Qinhua was one step ahead of them, the rest of them slapped their thighs and revealed a look of remorse, and what shocked them even more was that this woman was planning to send out their Heavenly Demon Sect's Heavenly Toad Silk, the treasure of the sect.
<br><br>You know, their Heavenly Devil ancestor's Heavenly Devil zither only got a small piece of Heavenly Toad Silk on it, even so, once the Heavenly Devil zither came out, there were not many rivals in the whole South Sand.
<br><br>Now he intends to send out the entire Heavenly Toad Silk, really willing to pay the blood money ah!
<br><br>It is angry that their clan does not have a treasure that can be used as a string, want to compete with the book qin painting, there is no way ah!
<br><br>For a while, the crowd could only hate Shu Qinhua, but there was nothing they could do about it.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled with surprise when he heard that, he was indeed struggling to find the string because it was broken.
<br><br>I didn't expect this sister to actually have one.
<br><br>Then since that was the case, then he was directly nonchalant and said with a smile, "Then thank you, Miss Shu, and of course I don't want yours for nothing."
<br><br>Speaking of this, Yi Feng slightly hesitated.
<br><br>I wanted to give money, but looking at this girl's dress and the fact that she would come here because of his zither sound, I think she must also be an artiste.
<br><br>This kind of person, give her money instead of too vulgar.
<br><br>After thinking about it, Yi Feng said, "Miss Shu, I saw you looking at my calligraphy and painting just now, I think you should be involved in calligraphy and painting besides the zither, right?"
<br><br>"Indeed some involved, just do not dare to compare in front of Mr. yet." Book Qin painting hastily got up and said.
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled.
<br><br>He didn't think this girl was blowing rainbow farts.
<br><br>Although this broken system is chicken-ribbed, but apart from not being able to cultivate, these miscellaneous skills are really nothing to speak of.
<br><br>Just like calligraphy and painting or something, he really does not vain who.
<br><br>"In that case, then I will give the girl a word or painting to the girl to express gratitude!" Yi Feng said with a smile: "Girl you can ask for anything you want me to write or paint."
<br><br>"Really?"
<br><br>"Many thanks, sir."
<br><br>Shu Qinhua's body trembled violently, her face showing wild joy as she excitedly got up and expressed her gratitude towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>Originally, she had gifted the Heavenly Toad Silk only to make a good relationship with this one, as well as to repay the spicy strips and the Xuan Paper chance just now, not daring to think at all that this one would gift her with a word painting.
<br><br>"Hate la!"
<br><br>And seeing this scene, the fifth Changkong and others next to him were so angry that their intestines turned blue, looking at Shu Qinhua's gaze was full of envy and jealousy.
<br><br>If I had known about this chance, even if I had poured out all my money, I would not have let Shu Qinhua take the top spot!
<br><br>But now, besides envy and jealousy, what is the use?
<br><br>"Sir, then I will leave you alone, after I get the Heavenly Toad Silk to your satisfaction, then I will dare to take your paintings and calligraphy." Seeing what was good, Book Qin Painting bowed towards Yi Feng and prepared to leave.
<br><br>"Good, thanks for the trouble."
<br><br>Yi Feng got up to see him off, and at the same time, he also felt that this sister was really nice.
<br><br>And also beautiful-looking.
<br><br>It seemed good to make a friend.
<br><br>The others, on the other hand, were red-faced and knew that there was no point in staying to go any longer, and after the book and qin painting, they also bid farewell.
<br><br>Can only be to find another opportunity to seek the opportunity.
<br><br>After sending off a few people, Yi Feng stretched a lazy back, went to the backyard to take a look at the stone platform again.
<br><br>Both the height and size are indeed quite in line with his wishes.
<br><br>I have to say, this old man Qingshan is still quite reliable in doing things, let's find a chance to carve out the expectation some day.
<br><br>"Huh?"
<br><br>Just then, Yi Feng suddenly found a sibilant sound coming from the miscellaneous room.
<br><br>He got close to listen, the sound was gone.
<br><br>Shaking his head, he was ready to leave, but before he stepped out of the courtyard, the sound of fidgeting came again.
<br><br>Yi Feng walked towards the utility room again.
<br><br>Sure enough, when he approached, the sound was gone again.
<br><br>He stood in place with a slightly narrowed gaze, pretending to stride away, and then tiptoed back to the door, and then kicked the locked door open with a fierce kick.
<br><br>Then he saw that the broken skull head is pouting in the digging.
<br><br>The kicked door hit his ass, immediately scared him jumped up with a jolt, at the same time mouth cursed: "Which killers dare to backstab me?"
<br><br>He turned his head in anger and was instantly confronted with Yi Feng's gut-wrenching face.
<br><br>The skeleton was instantly stunned in place and reacted by moving his body and blocking the sack behind him.
<br><br>"Get out of the way."
<br><br>Yi Feng spoke without question.
<br><br>"Aba aba!"
<br><br>The skeleton's face, humanized with a smile of dedication, slapped its upper and lower jaws and sent out a voice.
<br><br>However, just as his voice fell, a fist smashed on his head ......
<br><br>......
