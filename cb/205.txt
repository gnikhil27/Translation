"It's easy to get my heritage."
<br><br>"I used a sword for the first half of my life, but my talent in the sword dao was ultimately too poor, so I spent the second half of my life practicing my zither skills to enter the sage with the zither."
<br><br>"But after entering the sage with the zither, the world could no longer find a zither score that moved me."
<br><br>"So, if you can find the music that moves me, play it in front of me and satisfy me, then you will receive my inheritance!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu's voice shook the surroundings.
<br><br>The crowd set off an uproar.
<br><br>"A zither score."
<br><br>"It's actually a zither score!"
<br><br>While the crowd was talking, they were also pondering the point.
<br><br>"Senior, in order to obtain your inheritance, is it necessary to have a zither score that moves you, in addition to superb zither playing skills?" Fifth Longkong couldn't help but ask: "But most of us present really can't hold a candle to play the zither!"
<br><br>"Yes!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"We really don't know how to play the piano!"
<br><br>The crowd could not help but ask after the fifth long air.
<br><br>"Not also!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu's bell-like voice said, "I only need you to be able to compose a zither score that moves me, so that I can see your talent in the zither dao line, on the contrary, zither skills are not that important, because good zither skills, through time are able to practice."
<br><br>"So that's how it is."
<br><br>At these words, the crowd that just seemed lost had renewed hope.
<br><br>Play the zither this thing if not specialize in zither cultivation people, simply are not very good, but you have to say the score, this really can not say.
<br><br>It is likely that the blind barren messy spectrum, can also compose the world's tune.
<br><br>After all, the immortal river continent is now circulating the classic tune, many of them are from the hands of mortals, many of them simply have not even seen the piano, humming when working on the ground, was heard to adapt out.
<br><br>"So you can be bold enough to try."
<br><br>Jiang Yu again sent out a voice and said, "And those who succeed will not only be able to get my inheritance, this imperial zither table should also be given to you."
<br><br>As the voice fell, he waved a golden light in his hand.
<br><br>Then under the shocked gaze of the crowd, a half a zhang long and wide zither table appeared and was suspended in mid-air.
<br><br>As soon as it appeared, it carried a heavy aura, invisibly giving people a huge pressure.
<br><br>The body is sculpted with exquisite patterns, lifelike, the body is green, looks like stone, of course, the people present are clear that it must be made of some kind of unrecognizable top material.
<br><br>The appearance of this piano table.
<br><br>It made everyone present become frenzied.
<br><br>Imperial treasures, this is definitely a supreme existence in the Immortal River Continent, even ten or a hundred holy items cannot be compared to it.
<br><br>Hope reappeared in the hearts of Fifth Changkong and Peng Xian'er and the others.
<br><br>If they could obtain Jiang Yu's inheritance and obtain this Emperor's Pillar, all those sacred items would not matter at all.
<br><br>"Imperial goods, imperial goods, Miss, I remember that you also cultivate your mind with the zither in your spare time, you also hurry to try it!"
<br><br>And in the distance, Yang Mu looked at the Emperor's Grade zither platform in the sky, his eyes were full of frenzy, and he hurriedly shouted towards Yun Xian Que.
<br><br>Yun Xian Que was also full of excitement, and was just about to step forward, but suddenly remembered what Lu Qingshan said.
<br><br>His footsteps, at once, stopped in mid-air.
<br><br>"Remember the prophecy of that high person that Lu Qingshan said?" Yun Xian Que said.
<br><br>"Miss, you mean?"
<br><br>Yang Mu's eyes stared and incredulously passed out.
<br><br>"Good, that person but said, this ancient tomb and big danger it."
<br><br>Yun Xian Que said with a tight frown: "Since that one said that the holy relics have been short-changed by someone has been fulfilled, I see that the next prophecy, also eight or nine is not far from the truth."
<br><br>Hearing that, Yang Mu two people also can not pay attention.
<br><br>Originally, they did not put any thought into this so-called prophecy, but through the matter of the holy relic, it made them become bottomless as well.
<br><br>"Miss, so what is your plan?" Yang Mu asked.
<br><br>"Don't go!"
<br><br>Yun Xian Que gritted her teeth and made a decision, put her paws back and said, "Not only are we not going, but we are staying away from this place!"
<br><br>"Okay, fine!"
<br><br>The two Yang Mu nodded their heads, and in their hearts, they couldn't help but admire Yun Xian Que a little.
<br><br>Under the y confusion of the emperor's product, Yun Xian Que was actually able to really hold back because of the prophecy, this verve alone was enough for them to admit to themselves that they couldn't do it.
<br><br>"Let's begin!"
<br><br>Jiang Yu said solemnly.
<br><br>As his voice fell, his golden light flashed his body landed on the zither platform, then slowly sat down and closed his eyes.
<br><br>"I'll go first."
<br><br>Seeing this, a female cultivator in the crowd came out holding the zither, and then sat down on the ground.
<br><br>Subsequently.
<br><br>A melodious zither song, slowly play open.
<br><br>The crowd also had the sense to keep quiet and watched Jiang Yu's movements nervously.
<br><br>But what people didn't expect was that after the song fell, Jiang Yu, who was sitting on the zither platform, didn't even open his eyes for a moment.
<br><br>The female cultivator's face was a little ugly.
<br><br>While others were relieved, they also became more nervous.
<br><br>Because truth be told, just now that female cultivator played really good, but eyes did not even let Jiang Yu open a little, enough to see, want to take the inheritance, there is no simple.
<br><br>"Then senior I will play one more song."
<br><br>The female cultivator bit her red lips and was not discouraged.
<br><br>"Each person has only three chances, after three times, deprived of qualification." At this time, a deep voice came from Jiang Yu who was sitting on the zither platform.
<br><br>At the sound of that, the female cultivator immediately turned pale.
<br><br>The others were also shocked, and the people who had been foolish to move, did not dare to move, it seems to want to fish in troubled waters to try their luck, is not feasible.
<br><br>Not surprisingly, after the female cultivator played another song, Jiang Yu still did not open his eyes.
<br><br>So.
<br><br>Time passed slowly, during which many cultivators went up to try, even Fifth Longkong and Peng Xian'er also went to try once, but still did not move Jiang Yu in the slightest, but wasted an opportunity for nothing.
<br><br>"Elder Kong, send a message to the Heavenly Sword Sect to collect the best zither scores in the world as fast as possible and send them in the fastest time possible." Immediately, Peng Xian'er ordered towards the nearby Long Sword Empty.
<br><br>"Yes, Miss."
<br><br>Long Jiankong hurriedly swept out into the air.
<br><br>Seeing this, the fifth formation was not willing to lag behind, and also began to notify the Snow Blown Mountain Villa and summon the clan's forces to collect the zither scores.
<br><br>Originally, this kind of cheating, by definition, Jiang Yu is not allowed, after all, Jiang Yu clearly said that only those who write the zither score can get his heritage.
<br><br>But surprisingly, Jiang Yu did not stop Peng Xian'er's move.
<br><br>So, other forces followed suit, and many even pulled out foreign aid.
<br><br>All at once.
<br><br>Outside of Pingjiang City, the number of people gathered was increasing.
<br><br>But always, there was not even the qualification to make Jiang Yu open his eyes.
