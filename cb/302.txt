But the woman in black was trembling in place.
<br><br>Her plan.
<br><br>Had it been defeated before it even began to be implemented?
<br><br>However, what made her willow is that after Yi Feng sized her up for a few moments, he suddenly changed his mind.
<br><br>"Since the girl is tired and hungry, it's better to sit down." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Noticing that Yi Feng changed his attention directly after sizing her up for a round, the woman in black couldn't help but flush out a cold smile.
<br><br>Heh.
<br><br>Men.
<br><br>It is true that they are animals that think with their lower body, this is not, after seeing her looks, directly changed his attention?
<br><br>And Yi Feng is a sigh of relief.
<br><br>It's not easy to go out, look at this woman is thin, I'm afraid it's really hungry. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>It's just that, and apprentice's chat when you can talk, for the time being, give people convenience!
<br><br>"Many thanks."
<br><br>The woman in black lightly said, her face did not show any.
<br><br>After she sat down, also ordered a few small dishes, slightly open red lips, gently surrendered to move.
<br><br>This scene.
<br><br>In the eyes of many people, it looked great.
<br><br>And while eating, her stern gaze, also sizing up Yi Feng.
<br><br>In fact, she had been confused as to why the group of big shots from Nansha would lick this youth in front of her so much.
<br><br>There was even a Second Life Martial Emperor following him before.
<br><br>But at such a close distance, she couldn't detect the slightest difference in this youth at all.
<br><br>As for the cultivation, that is even more funny.
<br><br>Of course, it's not that she didn't think about whether Yi Feng's cultivation was so high that she couldn't capture half of it either.
<br><br>But this is simply a nightmare in the sky.
<br><br>With the Immortal Road cut off, the strongest person in the Immortal River Continent is only a Ten Life Martial Emperor.
<br><br>And with her strength, even if the ten life martial emperor deliberately hide cultivation, it is impossible for her not to detect half of it.
<br><br>This means that the Yi Feng in front of her is indeed a mortal.
<br><br>But it doesn't matter.
<br><br>It didn't matter to her what kind of cultivation this godly stick had, her goal was only Zhong Qing.
<br><br>It's just that she, a great beauty, was obviously sitting at the same table with him, why didn't this godly man say half a word?
<br><br>Even small talk, not even a word?
<br><br>Is this still a normal man?
<br><br>Could it be that he is looking for another way to act high and cold, so as to attract her attention?
<br><br>Hm.
<br><br>This kind of person, she has actually seen a lot of, this kind of childish tricks, but make her more disgusted.
<br><br>Then let's wait.
<br><br>Let's see who can be more calm.
<br><br>Thinking of this, she also closed her mouth, but slowly eat.
<br><br>And Yi Feng and Zhong Qing also buried their heads and ate.
<br><br>Because in Yi Feng's view, acquaintances eating together joking and laughing does not matter, and even encounter the kind of desolate pathless look is to go to the rivers and lakes to discuss some wine and drink also does not matter.
<br><br>But not familiar with people, especially women, in the meal also talk, is extremely rude.
<br><br>This is also considered a kind of respect for the opposite sex Yi Feng.
<br><br>Time.
<br><br>So slowly spent.
<br><br>Master and disciple two dishes are about to eat up, the wine jug in the wine is almost the bottom, in addition to the necessary to speak, the big and small pressed not to say any extra words.
<br><br>The woman in black is finally sullen.
<br><br>The blandness of the face has long disappeared, replaced by a gloomy.
<br><br>Okay.
<br><br>You are good!
<br><br>She held back the anger on her face, forcing a smile, and finally took the initiative to speak towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Today is really thanks to the two gentlemen, dare to ask the gentleman's name?" She said in a soft voice.
<br><br>"You're welcome, my name is Yi Feng, this is my disciple, Zhong Qing." Yi Feng smiled and said.
<br><br>"Mm!"
<br><br>The woman in black nodded and continued to wait for Yi Feng's next words.
<br><br>After all, she was thinking, she had already opened her mouth, you can't still keep this look, right?
<br><br>But.
<br><br>She once again overthought.
<br><br>Yi Feng, did not speak again, continued to bury his head in eating dishes.
<br><br>Looking at Yi Feng's appearance, the woman in black could not help but choke a mouthful, secretly fists clenched dead, clenched green.
<br><br>Good, good, good.
<br><br>I would like to see how long you can pretend.
<br><br>"Cough cough cough ......"
<br><br>Thinking of this, she coughed violently, clutching her stomach and blushing ugly.
<br><br>"Hmm?"
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng hurriedly got up and asked, "What's wrong with you, girl?"
<br><br>The woman in black secretly mouth red lips slightly hooked, secretly said you finally can't sit still?
<br><br>So she continued with an ugly face and said, "I don't know why, my stomach suddenly hurt."
<br><br>"So that's it."
<br><br>Yi Feng breathed a sigh of relief, it turned out to be just a small problem, so he smiled and reminded: "Then the girl drink more hot water!"
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng sat down again.
<br><br>Although he also knows a little bit of medicine, but he did not have the line on his body and no medicine, and moreover strange men and women are inconvenient, plus the stomach pain is not a major disease, so he can not help.
<br><br>Soon, Yi Feng two people finished eating, then went downstairs and left.
<br><br>Sitting there, the woman in black was trembling, and her green face was surging with a strong sense of anger.
<br><br>At this moment, she could not wait to directly shoot the two.
<br><br>She can see, there is his disciple must have his teacher ah!
<br><br>Such an uncomprehending man, she really is the first time to see ......
<br><br>After walking out of the restaurant, Yi Feng took Zhong Qing to rush back towards the land of chaos.
<br><br>But walking to the front street, but found next to the root of the wall, sitting under a goat-bearded old man.
<br><br>The old man was sitting there with his eyes closed, with a game of chess in front of him, and a banner next to him.
<br><br>On the banner was written: He who wins me, gets my heritage.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng immediately stupid.
<br><br>Damn.
<br><br>This goat-bearded old man is a cultivation master ah, if you get his heritage, will not be able to cultivate?
<br><br>Thinking of this, he hurriedly walked over and said with a fist: "This high man, how about I play a game with you?"
<br><br>Upon hearing this, the old Taoist with a goatee who had closed his eyes to recuperate finally opened his eyes.
<br><br>After taking a look at Yi Feng, the goat-bearded old man put his palm on Yi Feng's pulse.
<br><br>Although he didn't know what he wanted to do, Yi Feng still let him.
<br><br>A moment later, the goat-bearded old man waved his palm and said impatiently, "Those without spiritual roots, let's go."
<br><br>Upon hearing this, Yi Feng beamed, his expression filled with an ugly look.
<br><br>Dog system ah!
<br><br>Even if you don't teach me to cultivate, at least let me be able to have some spiritual roots!
<br><br>Worst travellers.
<br><br>Kam!
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha, why don't you let the poor monk play a game with you!" Just at that moment, another voice came from the side.
<br><br>Yi Feng turned his eyes to look and found a monk with clear eyebrows walking over.
<br><br>He was dressed in a bright robe, with a Confucian and smile, extraordinary temperament, a dusty body is not soft, giving people a sense of righteousness.
<br><br>This monk, let Yi Feng for a time a little dumbfounded.
<br><br>This look is a high monk ah.
<br><br>Just like a righteous light, scattered on the earth.
<br><br>Suddenly, a book fell out of his robe.
<br><br>Yi Feng hurriedly bent down to help pick it up, then saw that the book help was printed on a woman in revealing clothes, and a line of words.
<br><br>"This is, spring ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at the book gang and recited the name of the book on it.
<br><br>But before he could finish reading it, it was snatched back by that monk in lightning and hidden into the robe.
<br><br>"The monk looked at the wrong book, this is the Vajra Sutra!"
<br><br>The monk folded his hands and bowed slightly toward Yi Feng, explaining with a smile full of affinity.
