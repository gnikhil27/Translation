A high mountain surrounded by clouds and mists.
<br><br>With an ugly face, Shaking Heavenly Que stroked his not-so-long goatee and crossed his steps back and forth inside the pavilion.
<br><br>"Aiya, how can this be done!"
<br><br>"Dying, going to die."
<br><br>Then, he looked at Ye Bei on the side and asked, "Disciple, how many spiritual treasures do you still have in your hand?"
<br><br>"Why don't you share yours with master first?"
<br><br>"Anyway, I thought about it, you will not be able to put together a thousand or eight hundred pieces until you die, or how about settling the master's first?"
<br><br>Hearing that.
<br><br>Ye Bei's face is worse than the dead mother.
<br><br>"Master, I two or three pieces even if you give you so what, how long has the deadline passed now?" Ye Bei said with a black face: "That is, that senior is afraid that we do not take us to heart, forget about us for the time being, but one day think about this crop, is our death."
<br><br>A talk about the deadline. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>The master and disciple who owed a huge amount of debt became a dead face.
<br><br>"Come on, don't push and chatter."
<br><br>On the other side, Guan Yunpeng said with a black face: "You two are to blame for this, who told you to be blind and insist on hitting the iron plate, but you say I Guan Yunpeng who provoked who, originally and that senior relationship is not bad, but also by you into such a pit."
<br><br>"It's really careless in making friends, careless in making friends!"
<br><br>"Humph, you will just blame, no one knew it would be like this ah!" Shaking Heavenly Que shouted with a black face, "You have this effort to complain, you might as well think of a solution."
<br><br>"Solutions, who the hell has solutions?"
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng shouted: "We two broke the tiles of the predecessor thing aside, just your precious disciple owes a thousand or eight hundred pieces of spiritual treasures, your ancestors' entire family can not come together, you say where to get a solution?"
<br><br>"All right, stop it, it's a death, instead of this fear, why not take the three or two pieces of spiritual treasures in hand and go directly to the one." Ye Bei said dryly: "A good attitude plus that one is still in a good mood, perhaps still able to leave a way of life."
<br><br>"Good, I agree with your disciple's words."
<br><br>Guan Yunpeng also said: "That senior I have more contact with him than you guys, he still has a forgiving heart towards his juniors, if we have a good attitude, there is no chance of turning around."
<br><br>"All right!"
<br><br>Shake the sky Que analyzed a bit, gritted his teeth and agreed.
<br><br>Because now there is indeed no other way, run can not run that palm, and every day to be afraid, it is better to face directly.
<br><br>After the three discussed.
<br><br>They took their entire fortune and rushed towards Pingjiang City.
<br><br>Martial arts school.
<br><br>Yi Feng was planning to establish a sect.
<br><br>Although this world's sect Yi Feng has not visited, but in his previous life movies and novels have seen a lot.
<br><br>So he sorted out his thoughts.
<br><br>First of all, how to accept disciples?
<br><br>It seems that in addition to coaxing, there is no other way.
<br><br>So the sect must be decent, or else people look at your thatched roof two or three, certainly not willing to join.
<br><br>So the surface work must be done.
<br><br>The first step: a noble-looking mountain gate, a bullish statue.
<br><br>This Yi Feng is already a solution, the mountain door spend more money to get higher is, the statue better solution, carving a fucking dragon in the middle of the clan door on the line.
<br><br>The second step: the clan to look fairy air drifting, misty.
<br><br>This Yi Feng also has a solution, intends to use the chemical principles of the previous life, to the sect to get some smoke or something out, like a stage effect is no problem, as for is not aura or something is not important, the key is the face of the project.
<br><br>The third step: the clan's book collection.
<br><br>This is also necessary, well in Yi Feng's previous life is also an intellectual, intend to blind chicken to write some spiritual chicken soup, Laozi Mencius said what stuffed in, as to whether others can comprehend something, it is not really possible to say.
<br><br>The fourth step: the clan's back mountain and forbidden places.
<br><br>This is also very necessary, so as to appear a clan's heritage, as for what is inside the back of the mountain, it does not matter. So Yi Feng intends to catch some beasts to put inside, usually can make a little roar, look bull on the line.
<br><br>The fifth step: the clan's protective mountain beast, the bottom of the master.
<br><br>But after thinking for half a day, Yi Feng reluctantly chose a way, that is, the snail as a protective mountain beast, after all, this thing no one has ever seen, such a large snail, may really be able to bluff people. And the bottom of the experts, it is intended to choose the skeleton Ben Wei, when the time to reveal his skull head, should also be able to scare people.
<br><br>In addition, there are some seven or eight places, residence ah, public areas, martial arts training ground or something.
<br><br>Finally, the most important thing is that people's disciples come, you have to teach them a little something, right?
<br><br>Teach people to cultivate?
<br><br>This thing is definitely not possible, this life is impossible, a teaching will be exposed.
<br><br>So Yi Feng thought about it, or from their own good at the start.
<br><br>For example, the new disciple can first teach him to play the piano, chess, winemaking, carving, etc., but also the name is to cultivate the body, in order to improve the cultivation and lay the foundation.
