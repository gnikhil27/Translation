Wow!
<br><br>A fist broke the sky.
<br><br>Immediately afterwards the sky ripped open a huge mouth, bringing a powerful pressure to people.
<br><br>Nearby range, both demons and humans, under this fist, all of them are scared with fear.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Whether it is the old man holding the boat on the lake, or in the side of the big man cutting trees, did not show any shocked expression.
<br><br>Not just a broken sky, the daily routine, there is no big surprise.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>West demon forest three demons are scared liver.
<br><br>"Tiantiantian, the sky really broke."
<br><br>Stammering voice came out from their mouths, their faces covered with panic. One second to remember http://m.biquxs.com
<br><br>Never thought, actually can really witness such a thing that defies common sense.
<br><br>The milk leopard Li looked up at the sky for a long time did not dissipate the shadow of the fist, full of worship.
<br><br>Although this was the second time she saw it, but its power and the impact that the figure brought her, but still did not cut.
<br><br>She was lucky to have such an opportunity.
<br><br>She was also glad that she was able to seize the opportunity.
<br><br>Unable to help herself, she turned her gaze to the three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest.
<br><br>"The three commanders, you?"
<br><br>Her gaze was complicated as she continued to persuade, although as a junior, she really had some hatred for these three seniors.
<br><br>But what she did not expect was that before she could say her words of persuasion, the three demons of the rhinoceros forest crunched their knees to the side of Bone Ben Wei.
<br><br>"Lord Skeleton."
<br><br>"We are loyal to you and to that lord on the island."
<br><br>"Yes, we are loyal."
<br><br>"And also and also, you are the most handsome in the world."
<br><br>For a time, the three demons incoherently expressed their loyalty, just as close to pulling out their hearts.
<br><br>A series of actions, look at the milk leopard Li stare and staggered.
<br><br>This oily mouth slippery appearance, or before the three vowed not to submit to the commander?
<br><br>This transformation is too fast!
<br><br>However.
<br><br>She was finally relieved.
<br><br>Fortunately, these three commanders, not a tendon col to the end.
<br><br>And at this time, Yi Feng stood on the bamboo raft, from the island towards this side, apparently saw the returned skeleton Ben Wei and others.
<br><br>With the arrival of Yi Feng, the eyes of all the demons were cast forgetting, also including the immortal world demons who just woke up.
<br><br>This person obviously no fluctuations in his body, but when he approached, without exception, felt the suppression, the body's power is not exerted in the slightest, not to mention that even speech is also suppressed.
<br><br>What the hell is this person?
<br><br>The immortal world demons can not help but think so.
<br><br>"Not bad, I didn't expect you to really catch so many back." Yi Feng glanced at Bone Ben Wei and laughed leisurely.
<br><br>"Hey, hey, hey."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei laughed honestly in front of Yi Feng's face.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Seeing this.
<br><br>The immortal world demons' hearts burst.
<br><br>They had experienced the weirdness and terror of Bone Ben Wei, a small sentence made Black Feather solve them effortlessly, this was enough to represent his power.
<br><br>However, it is such a terrifying black robe, in front of this human, but also honestly?
<br><br>They instantly understood.
<br><br>This person in front of them, I'm afraid, is the real big shot.
<br><br>And looking at him talking, it seemed like he was also leading the charge behind the scenes to capture them over.
<br><br>But, what exactly was his purpose in doing so?
<br><br>Him.
<br><br>What exactly is he again?
<br><br>These demonic beasts from the immortal world pondered deeply ......
<br><br>At the same time, at this moment, they were surprisingly calm.
<br><br>Because they understand, in front of this kind of person, unnecessary resistance is of no use at all, only to explore this person's purpose, and then find the opportunity to escape, and then report back to Su Xuanjun what happened here is the king's way.
<br><br>"OK, let me take a look at what you have caught back."
<br><br>Yi Feng put his hands behind his back and looked at the crowd of demons bound by chains.
<br><br>"A leopard ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng's first glance will look at the milk leopard Li, looking up and down.
<br><br>Milk leopard Li immediately scalp numb, heart full of tension, low head trembling.
<br><br>"Okay, this one reluctantly accept it."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head.
<br><br>And milk leopard Li also instantly relieved, it seems that they are considered to have been recognized by this one.
<br><br>After his eyes strayed from Milk Leopard Li, Yi Feng happened to drop his gaze back to the three demons of the rhinoceros forest.
<br><br>If it was before, they were afraid they would be all kinds of unconvinced.
<br><br>But just now, seeing Yi Feng's terrifying punch, they no longer dared to have any thoughts and instantly prostrated themselves on the ground.
<br><br>However, Yi Feng's next sentence directly knocked them into the bottom.
<br><br>"These three caught before do not look too honest, and too shabby, throw away throw away."
<br><br>Yi Feng waved his hand and said impatiently.
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>Skull Benevolent nodded and grabbed the three of them with a milk dose and dragged them away.
<br><br>"Ow!"
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>The three demons struggled and tried to speak, but they could not speak, they could only let out a roar while struggling desperately.
<br><br>But they where able to break free from the skeleton Ben Wei, and was immediately thrown into the distance.
<br><br>A time.
<br><br>The three demons who were down and out had their intestines turned blue with regret.
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, where they did not hear, was disgusted that they were not honest enough before and did not submit at first.
<br><br>But when they now wake up, it is already too late.
<br><br>Regret, it is no longer useful.
<br><br>They understand.
<br><br>The heavenly chance had already been lost to them.
<br><br>Hate!
<br><br>Hate!
<br><br>After losing the three demons of the Rhinoceros Forest, finally, under the gaze of all the demons in the Immortal World, Yi Feng came before them.
<br><br>This instantly made them nervous.
<br><br>Perhaps it was possible to see what this person really wanted at this moment.
<br><br>"These, are okay."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded, then asked, "By the way, they were all captured from the same place?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei nodded his head in a hurry.
<br><br>"Where is the head, there should be a head, right, not captured?"
<br><br>Yi Feng could not help but ask, after all, he also has a lot of experience from the forest, generally these mountain forest beasts, are more organized and group, and generally there is a head for the head.
<br><br>And these beasts in front of me look okay, so Yi Feng immediately interested in that head of them.
<br><br>Should look quite with the force, right?
<br><br>If you catch that king together, should be able to add some tone to his back mountain ah!
<br><br>"Nope, didn't catch it."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei lowered his head.
<br><br>"Okay, then let's keep these beasts in custody first, and take another trip some day to catch that king as well." Yi Feng said leisurely.
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>Bones Ben Wei nodded his head.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>However, the hearts of the immortal world demons were fiercely tightened.
<br><br>This person's target.
<br><br>It was actually the Continent Lord Su Xuanjun!
