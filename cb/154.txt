Ao Qing made his way back to the martial arts school.
<br><br>After going around the martial arts hall, he finally found his skeleton brother at the back of the martial arts hall.
<br><br>At this moment after the skull escaped from the poisonous hands of Yi Feng, he could not help but come here, I do not know where the whole to a lounge chair, lying on it playing the bushel fan at the same time, is pointing at a few people.
<br><br>From time to time, the body reveals the breath, so that Wu Yonghong a few people do not dare to breathe a breath, and even nimbly dry work.
<br><br>And many times encountered the skull poisoned Lu Dasheng, but also picked that load of dung darted up, afraid that this one caught him and a roux.
<br><br>Seeing this, Ao Qing couldn't wait to dash over.
<br><br>"Brother, brother, my lovely and handsome skull brother, so you are here!" Ao Qing shouted with a face full of excitement.
<br><br>At that, the skeleton did not show traces of chest, faintly said: "So it is Qing ah, looking for brother what is the matter?"
<br><br>"Brother, I'm going to be fucked, you quickly help brother!" Ao Qing hurriedly came over, his little paws earnestly hammering the skull's thighs, while telling Ao Qingcheng roughly what happened."
<br><br>"Oh, so it's a few little trash!"
<br><br>The skeleton did not care to say: "Do not put in mind, these few little trash master will solve at hand, you continue to go watch the door, I still have things here!" First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Okay!"
<br><br>Ao Qing hurriedly ran towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>After Ao Qing left, the skeleton stood up from the recliner, walked towards the cesspit with his hands folded, and suddenly pointed at Rudasheng and passed out a tirade.
<br><br>"You, that bucket of dung on the right is obviously not full enough, actually cheating in front of this marshal, damn!"
<br><br>The voice fell at the same time, the skeleton caught Rudasheng a violent beating, followed by a kick into the dung pit, before the back palm of the hand nothing to re-approach the recliner.
<br><br>The three old men who were hoeing saw this scene and shivered, while a cold sweat welled up on their backs, and they were busy looking at the skeleton with respectful eyes, their expressions full of fear and awe.
<br><br>"Don't worry, you guys work well, I'm still a very good person to talk to."
<br><br>The skeleton re-lay down in the recliner, as if self-congratulatory waved his hand towards them to show his calmness.
<br><br>"Dogs, make trouble again!"
<br><br>However, in the next moment, there was a sudden shout of curses from behind him, and a long leg flew in and kicked the skeleton to the ground.
<br><br>"Aba Aba!"
<br><br>The skeleton lifted its head and opened its mouth.
<br><br>"Bani Ma, the dog coin thing can actually talk, you talk to me Baba Baba?"
<br><br>Yi Feng cursed viciously and was about to kick down again when the skeleton dragged its black robe from under Yi Feng's ass and drew his legs to run.
<br><br>Angry Yi Feng picked up a stone on the ground, towards the skeleton smashed in the past, smashing his wailing feet flying, followed by a slip of smoke, and no shadow.
<br><br>This scene, to Wu Yonghong three people to look silly, forehead wiping cold sweat.
<br><br>"You guys keep working, keep working."
<br><br>Yi Feng said with a black face, busy to look at the Lu Dasheng, and Lu Dasheng is full of aggression to climb out of the dung pit.
<br><br>Seeing this, Yi Feng drew a breath of cold air backwards, and the corners of his mouth couldn't help but twitch twice.
<br><br>Boy!
<br><br>What a pity.
<br><br>This motherfucker, that covered in shit look, is still a person?
<br><br>Forget it, let's give him twenty more gold coins then, Yi Feng shook his head, covered his nose and was busy rushing back towards the martial arts school.
<br><br>Then ordered a bowl of beef noodles and tripped down on the recliner.
<br><br>And at the moment, Ao Qing is lying down next to Yi Feng, a moment to sit up, a moment to lie down again, the performance is very uneasy.
<br><br>In his heart, he was hesitating whether to report the matter of Ao Qingcheng and others to Yi Feng.
<br><br>But he did not dare.
<br><br>After following Yi Feng for so long, where does he not know Yi Feng's mentality of sensing mortal life?
<br><br>Since Yi Feng raised it as a dog, he can only think of himself as a dog, suddenly if the mouth speaks, he will not break this ring!
<br><br>Besides, since the skeleton brother said that, with the master's heavenly cultivation, I'm afraid these things are known, right?
<br><br>And will help themselves to solve it, right?
<br><br>However, Yi Feng looked at the restless dog, but frowned slightly.
<br><br>"Alas, it's also hard for you."
<br><br>That unsettled look, Yi Feng instantly guessed what the dog needed, stroked his head, could not help but softly comfort.
<br><br>"But since with me, I will certainly do my master's duty, should help you solve the problem, will definitely help you solve, do not worry!"
<br><br>At these words, Ao Qing's eyes lit up.
<br><br>At once, his face showed gratitude.
<br><br>Sure enough, the master's heavenly cultivation to all this has long known, and also clearly state to help themselves to solve this matter.
<br><br>So, he put his heart into his stomach and laid down obediently to Yi Feng's feet.
<br><br>At this time, not far from the martial arts school, several shadows swept past like ghosts, and then landed in a dark place, the leader of the woman slightly raised her chin, revealing the fair face of the country.
<br><br>It was Ao Qingcheng and others who came to track Ao Qing.
<br><br>"Ao Qing, right here in this small human martial school!"
<br><br>The corner of Ao Qingcheng's mouth raised slightly, and an ice-cold voice came out.
