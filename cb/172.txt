 A demon djinn?
<br><br>It is actually a demon daddy?
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang's mind was like a thunderstorm, feeling that the whole person is dumbfounded.
<br><br>How did Ao Qing suddenly become a demon?
<br><br>If it wasn't for the pressure Ao Qing was exuding at the moment hitting his heart, plus seeing it with his own eyes, he wouldn't have believed what was happening in front of him.
<br><br>But now even though he could not figure out how Ao Qing, the trash, had become a demon, the situation at hand did not allow him to think so much.
<br><br>"Retreat!" 
<br><br>In an emergency, he hurriedly shouted out.
<br><br>"What?"
<br><br>"Withdraw again?"
<br><br>Hearing Ao Bi Fang's words, the demons who were rushing towards Ao Qing were once again confused. First issue domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>However.
<br><br>At this time, they also felt the powerful aura that erupted from Ao Qing's body, and were immediately scared with cold sweat.
<br><br>Demon daddy!
<br><br>It turned out to be a demon daddy.
<br><br>Hoo!
<br><br>How is Ao Qing a demon daddy.
<br><br>No wonder we have to withdraw ah!
<br><br>They instantly understood, and the same careless heart shock, almost pulled up their feet and began to run.
<br><br>Speed, do not know how many times faster than when they came. Each one scrambled, afraid that Ao Qing behind them to catch up.
<br><br>How much they used to despise Ao Qing, how scared they are at this moment.
<br><br>However, Ao Qing, who had awakened at this moment, was not willing to let them go, and with a flick of his claws, a huge force whistled towards the fleeing Ao Bi Fang and the others.
<br><br>"Phew!"
<br><br>This claw, can be described as a row of mountains, trees collapsed open, the mountain was razed to the ground.
<br><br>The demon emperors in Ao Bi Fang's camp were almost dead under this claw, and those demon sect experts also suffered badly, falling to the ground in pieces, spitting blood from their mouths.
<br><br>"Damn, damn!"
<br><br>Climbing up from the ground, the ashen-headed Ao Bi Fang cursed out with a red face.
<br><br>He never thought that they would be defeated at the hands of Ao Qing even though they had been defeated at the Martial Hall with such a strong lineup.
<br><br>Clearly a waste, and suddenly become a demon daddy, this world in the end what is going on!
<br><br>But he just roared out, Ao Qing stared at him.
<br><br>This pair of eyes directly creeped him out.
<br><br>But before he had time to react, Ao Qing gently raised his claws again, and then zoomed in the sky violently, like a big mountain pressing towards him.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>The power of this palm almost scared Ao Bi Fang's guts out, and his Demon Sect Perfection cultivation was exerted to the extreme, and he dodged away with a roll.
<br><br>The next moment he dodged away, the claw finally fell down.
<br><br>"Boom!"
<br><br>A huge blast sounded, and the whole mountain forest shook as if an earthquake had occurred.
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang, who had escaped death, looked at the big pit in front of him, breathing heavily, looking as wretched as he could be.
<br><br>But although he escaped this disaster, his men may not have such good luck, two demon clan was killed by this claw.
<br><br>Another loss of two demon clan, Ao Bi Fang is simply heart is dripping blood.
<br><br>This is the mainstay of his Red Sun lineage ah, the death of Xiu Luo and Fu Dao is hard enough for him, this blow, simply to drive him crazy.
<br><br>But the next moment, he found Ao Qing locked on him again.
<br><br>That claw, is actually in once slowly raised.
<br><br>Karma!
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang was sweating coldly.
<br><br>More serious is that at this moment, he is already unable to retreat.
<br><br>Under all thoughts, he gritted his teeth with a face full of reluctance and took out a scroll.
<br><br>Once the scroll came out, it emitted a dazzling light.
<br><br>"Ao Qing, we can't spare you."
<br><br>Ao Bi Fang cursed with a gloomy face, remembering that this scroll, which he had hidden for more than a thousand years, was about to be used in this way, it was simply a pain in the heart.
<br><br>And as the voice fell, the scroll's light flourished to its peak, and then Ao Bi Fang and the others disappeared.
<br><br>"Humph!"
<br><br>"If I hadn't just made a breakthrough and my cultivation level was still unstable, otherwise you guys would really be able to escape my palm?"
<br><br>Looking at the people who disappeared, the dog Ao Qing disdainfully voiced out.
<br><br>"But the master really loves me ah, so a big pot of Wang Bajie soup are given to me to drink, especially the bottom of those drug essence, simply heavenly, actually let me from the demon king directly breakthrough to the demon daddy!"
<br><br>"Yes."
<br><br>"It must be because the master calculated that Ao Bi Fang and these old bastards were going to mess with me, so he purposely gave me this opportunity."
<br><br>"The master's divine calculation really convinced me, even the time is stuck, I just broke through this group of foolish hangers came."
<br><br>"I guess the master also wants to use them to give me practice!"
<br><br>As soon as he thought of this, the dog Ao Qing's eyes flashed with a fiery gaze.
<br><br>Once upon a time, he was just a despised existence in the tribe, but now, not only did he engage Ao Qingcheng, but also the entire tribe had to look up to the existence.
<br><br>All this is because of the master.
<br><br>With the stronger the cultivation, the more you can feel the master's powerful ah!
