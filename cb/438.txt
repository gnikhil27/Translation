"An old man?"
<br><br>Zhu made light full of surprise.
<br><br>Usually cheat can not cheat, even forcefully catch a few on the mountain, the end result is also run away.
<br><br>This is now good, suddenly came an old man to enter the sect, it seems strange.
<br><br>But remembering that the old man's arrival could just fill the disciple who had fallen to his death, Zhu made the light wave his hand and shouted, "All right, all right, old man is old man, let the old man come in first."
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The disciple hurriedly retreated.
<br><br>Then under his leadership, an old man in his fifties walked in.
<br><br>"Wait by the side for a while first, this Sovereign will deal with some matters."
<br><br>Zhu Yingguang, who was sitting at the top, looked down at the letter in his hand and instructed.
<br><br>Obviously. Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>More than the old man with the eyes, he was more concerned about the supplies and letters suddenly sent by the four clans.
<br><br>Hearing the words.
<br><br>The disciple retreated.
<br><br>The old man was waiting at the bottom.
<br><br>In the hall, there was only the sound of Zhu making the light turn the pages of the book ......
<br><br>After speculating for a long time, he was still confused about what the four clans had suddenly sent him, and only after nothing, he put the correspondence aside.
<br><br>Remembering that there was still an old man waiting, he lifted the cup of tea next to him while slowly raising his head.
<br><br>"Crap."
<br><br>This raising of his head immediately caused him to shiver in shock, and the teacup in his hand was knocked over to the ground.
<br><br>"Sword Sword Patriarch, why are you coming over?"
<br><br>At this moment, Zhu makes the light cold sweat, his tongue can not be stroked.
<br><br>Also never thought that his Qingniu clan actually ushered in such a big god today, the patriarch of the hall Hengtian Sword Sovereign came to his Qingniu clan in person.
<br><br>The most critical thing is that he actually hung him out to dry for so long.
<br><br>Thinking of the latter's possible anger, Zhu makes light only feel the scalp numb, legs soft to kneel down, mouth hurriedly apologize.
<br><br>However.
<br><br>Jian Hengtian did not have the slightest intention of blaming him, instead, he bowed towards him and laughed loudly, "Hahaha, Sovereign Zhu, you are really too polite, you and I are as close as a family, it's only right to wait for you for a while."
<br><br>Jian Hengtian's politeness made Zhu Yingguang flattered and baffled.
<br><br>This kind of person, not to mention coming to his Qingniu Clan, he, as the sect master of the Qingniu Clan, had only met him once from afar.
<br><br>The two are simply not a level of people, right?
<br><br>So.
<br><br>The more polite Jian Hengtian was, the more flustered Zhu made light.
<br><br>The more polite he was, the more flustered he became. Shivering, he asked, "Patriarch Jian, don't bash me, I really can't stand this.
<br><br>"Uh, didn't the disciples of your clan make it very clear just now?" Jian Hengtian said with a smile, "I am here to join your Green Ox Sect."
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Zhu Yingguang shivered again and said with a bitter smile on his face, "You shouldn't be joking, Sovereign Jian, how could you, a great god, join my Green Ox Sect?"
<br><br>However.
<br><br>No sooner had Zhu Yingguang's voice fallen than a loud laugh came from outside.
<br><br>"What kind of great god is Jian Hengtian, Patriarch Zhu had better not let him join the Green Ox Sect."
<br><br>After the voice fell, another figure arrived in the Green Ox Hall.
<br><br>Seeing the visitor, Jian Hengtian's face turned iron and asked in a deep voice, "What are you doing running here?"
<br><br>"Humph, only you are allowed to come, but not me?"
<br><br>The visitor glared at Jian Hengtian, then smilingly came in front of Zhu Yingguang and arched his hands politely, "Greetings, Sovereign Zhu."
<br><br>"You, you are?"
<br><br>Zhu Yingguang's mouth shivered as he couldn't help but ask.
<br><br>"Abruptly, Sovereign Zhu, don't be offended, again under Li Canghai." The visitor said with a smile on his face.
<br><br>"Li?"
<br><br>"Canghai?"
<br><br>Zhu made the light scared even back legs a few steps, staring with eyes full of confusion.
<br><br>Boy ah.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here.
<br><br>His fart-sized Qingniu clan, actually came another god.
<br><br>But before he could greet Li Canghai, two more streams of light swept outside and landed outside the Qingniu Hall.
<br><br>Before people came in, they heard voices.
<br><br>"Jian Hengtian, Li Canghai, you two old pigs, you've come quite fast!"
<br><br>"Hmph, it's good that we also caught up, otherwise we would have let you guys take the lead."
<br><br>Finally, a man and a woman walked in.
<br><br>"You guys can't be?"
<br><br>Seeing that two more came and spoke to Jian Hengtian and Li Canghai in such a tone, Zhu made his eyelids jump and a bold guess rose in his heart, but he was not sure and couldn't help but ask out.
<br><br>Just as he asked, the man and woman came towards him, confirming his suspicion.
<br><br>"Liu Gu Yi, pay respects to Sovereign Zhu."
<br><br>"Yun Tianlong, meet Sovereign Zhu."
<br><br>Zhu made Guang directly fainted on the ground.
<br><br>The shock was too great for him!
<br><br>I'm afraid that even if that Martial King level ancestor of his Green Ox Sect had popped out from his grave, he wouldn't have thought that today, his Green Ox Sect would actually gather the four great patriarchs together.
<br><br>You know, he is only a Martial Spirit.
<br><br>And the four in front of him are Martial Emperor level existence, shaking a foot can make the North Sea tremble three figures.
<br><br>The difference is really too big.
<br><br>When Zhu made the light wake up, but found the four patriarchs around him, all kinds of worry out.
<br><br>"Sovereign Zhu is all right."
<br><br>"Sovereign Zhu is perhaps overworked."
<br><br>"But it's no harm, I have a Zong Pin level pill here, Patriarch Zhu will be able to take it and get better."
<br><br>"Don't bring out your broken clan grade one, come on, I have this holy grade one."
<br><br>Looking at these four patriarchs who are overly enthusiastic, Zhu makes light at this moment is not flattered at all, but even the chicken is trembling nervously.
<br><br>"Four big brothers, you guys don't play with me, what the hell do you have going on!"
<br><br>Zhu made the light with a crying voice and asked nervously.
<br><br>"What kind of words are these, Sovereign Zhu, we are really here to join your sect."
<br><br>"Yes, in the future, all four of us are Sovereign Zhu's people."
<br><br>Zhu made the light's scalp tingle.
<br><br>"You guys really?"
<br><br>"Yes!"
<br><br>The four of them spoke in unison.
<br><br>Zhu made Guang swallowed with a dry mouth and steadied his mind.
<br><br>Only after another glance at the solemn four did he unbelievably accept this dreamlike fact.
<br><br>"Then, what about any positions I have arranged for the four of you in my Green Ox Sect?"
<br><br>"Elder, Vice Patriarch?"
<br><br>Zhu Yingguang asked cautiously.
<br><br>Even though he didn't know what exactly these four great gods had in mind, he could only try to arrange it this way.
<br><br>"Aiya, Patriarch Zhu, why do you need to be so polite, just arrange a handyman for us." Jian Hengtian said with a smirk.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, it's fine to be a handyman."
<br><br>The others also looked at Zhu Yingguang with expectant faces.
<br><br>Once again, Zhu Huaguang was dumbfounded.
<br><br>What was that flash of gaze in the four people's eyes just now?
<br><br>It was fanaticism!
<br><br>That's right, he actually saw in these four people's eyes the fervor for his status as a servant disciple of the Green Ox Sect.
<br><br>Oh my god.
<br><br>What the hell is going on here.
<br><br>If word of this got out, it was estimated that the ancestor of his Green Ox Sect could be scared to death.
<br><br>Just when his head was confused, several storage rings were handed over to him.
<br><br>"Sovereign Zhu, please accept them."
<br><br>"Yes, please be accommodating."
<br><br>"A small meaning, no respect."
<br><br>Looking at the four storage rings in his hand, Zhu made his eyes widen.
<br><br>This is ......
<br><br>A gift?
<br><br>Zhu makes the light has been unable to speak, crunch draws past, direct myocardial infarction ......
