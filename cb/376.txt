"I will definitely find you."
<br><br>On the edge of the lake, after lifting the oddly shaped statue onto the boat, Yi Feng couldn't help but look up to the sky and sigh a long time.
<br><br>"Can't you still grow your own legs and fly off?"
<br><br>muttered two sentences, the heart of the two days ago in the vicinity of the work accidentally dropped the money bag, is always nostalgic.
<br><br>After looking around and not finding it, he reluctantly took Monk Kunpeng to board the island.
<br><br>"The monk here is well built!"
<br><br>After boarding, the monk's gentle voice came out.
<br><br>"That's for sure."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled with satisfaction, picked up a brick from his feet, weighed it in his hand and said confidently, "Look, you must not have seen a brick of my quality!"
<br><br>"You're a brick?"
<br><br>Seeing the brick in Yi Feng's hand, the monk Kun Peng, who had been mildly smiling, couldn't help but have his eyes jump. First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Otherwise, there are angles."
<br><br>Yi Feng looked at Monk Kunpeng strangely.
<br><br>"Uh."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng was dumbfounded, and after a moment of reprieve asked again, "So this brick of yours, what are you going to use it for?"
<br><br>"Look at what you're saying ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng again could not help but white this monk, spat: "you say bricks are used for what, of course, is used to build a wall, can not be used to eat?"
<br><br>"Actually build a wall!"
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng's soft face could not help but twitch, and asked, "So you have a lot of these bricks?"
<br><br>"That's not it, can a brick put up a wall, so there's a bunch more over there." Yi Feng glanced at the distance and said, "Not only that, there are still being made all the time over there."
<br><br>Hearing that, monk Kunpeng looked over.
<br><br>His mouth couldn't help but twitch.
<br><br>Sure enough, there was really a whole lot of them!
<br><br>He took a deep breath, not knowing what expression to make, and only after a long time did he say, "Master Shih is good with materials."
<br><br>"Fallacious praise fallacious praise."
<br><br>Yi Feng modestly laughed: "In fact, the quality of this brick made is still far from my requirements, but it is always better than other bricks, let's put it in perspective!"
<br><br>"Amitabha Buddha."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng folded his hands and seemed to not want to talk to Yi Feng about this, so he changed the subject and said, "Master, I am here to make a fortune, I hope the master will make it easy!"
<br><br>"The food is good to talk, but I suddenly have an idea I want to talk to you, Master." Yi Feng suddenly remembered what, busy said.
<br><br>"Please speak, Master."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng asked in a soft voice.
<br><br>"Where is the master's teacher from and which temple is it?" Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Poor monk four seas for home, and no origin, just idle monk." Kun Peng explained.
<br><br>"Oops, so that's how it is ......"
<br><br>Saying that, Yi Feng's smile intensified, rubbed his palms and said with a smile, "Now this chaotic world suffering ah, it is difficult to eat ah, such as the master, I'm afraid often hungry for the last meal without the next meal, right?"
<br><br>"What do you mean by that, Master?"
<br><br>Monk Kun Peng lifted his head and turned his gaze to look.
<br><br>"I think so, people, to be compassionate, such as monk you do not have food, and no residence, I am a compassionate person if not encountered it, but encountered, if not to help, I really heart is not safe ah!
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed a long breath, could not help but feel: "So I was thinking ah, it just so happens that I plan to get a small sect in this island outside the world, or monk you here I, stay?"
<br><br>"At least this way, you also do not have to run around to make a fortune, and I also count a good thing, it is not the best of both worlds?"
<br><br>After saying that, Yi Feng raised his eyebrows towards Monk Kunpeng.
<br><br>"I appreciate the kindness of the monk, but I am used to being idle." Monk Kunpeng smiled and politely refused.
<br><br>At those words.
<br><br>Yi Feng's eyebrows instantly frowned.
<br><br>Damn it.
<br><br>He originally wanted to fool the monk to open an opening and accept a disciple first, but now it seems that the monk does not fall for it.
<br><br>No way.
<br><br>He is a Chinese man, do everything to get a good fortune.
<br><br>So you can't just let it go.
<br><br>"Say, what do you want to be able to stay."
<br><br>Yi Feng simply did not pretend, and directly indicated his attitude.
<br><br>"It's better for the monk not to force anyone." Monk Kunpeng said gently.
<br><br>"You just really do not stay, I give you food to give you clothes, what do not want you to do, you give me on the island to strengthen the popularity of good." Yi Feng said.
<br><br>"It's not that you don't stay."
<br><br>"Just no reason for me to stay."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng laughed softly, "If the monk really wants me to stay, you must give me a reason to stay, or rather, have a motivation to make me stay."
<br><br>"Good."
<br><br>Yi Feng agreed readily and said busily, "As long as you stay, I will build you a small temple on the island."
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng shook his head.
<br><br>"Then I'll find someone to make you a custom robe, so you can wear it like a high monk." Yi Feng said again.
<br><br>Monk Kunpeng still shook his head and remained unmoved.
<br><br>Yi Feng was a little anxious and said again, "Then I'll get you a Buddha in addition to building you a temple, and let you receive incense."
<br><br>But never thought that the monk Kunpeng still laughed and shook his head.
<br><br>Seems to have no half interest in what Yi Feng said.
<br><br>Yi Feng's heart directly cursed.
<br><br>This monk, really fucking weird, give what do not want, so he really did not know how to be good for a while.
<br><br>Can think of the promise he made out, do not want to get a woman?
