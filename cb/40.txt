Yi Feng's eyebrows knitted and his meaningful gaze looked at Mao Lin.
<br><br>"Aiya, Mr. Yi doesn't have to be polite." Seeing that Yi Feng seemed to be stunned, Mao Lin slightly puffed out his chest and said, "Although a thousand gold coins is indeed quite a lot, but you should not have any heart burden, this is my apology to you, you can just accept it directly."
<br><br>At these words.
<br><br>The meaningful emotion on Yi Feng's face became even greater, so he opened the door and said, "Chairman Mao or just say what's going on!"
<br><br>"Ahem, then I will say it straight."
<br><br>Coughing, Mao Lin said with a smile, "Since you left that day, I thought about it, ah, now is the era of cultural revival, and the development of my Chamber of Commerce coincides with ah, so I intend ah, continue to cooperate with you, Master Yi, the Chamber of Commerce to help you publish books with all its strength."

<br><br>This old skin!
<br><br>Can't help but, Yi Feng raised the corners of his mouth, leisurely asked: "Chairman Mao this is not good ah, that day you son but personally told me that the book is not much interest, so I think Chairman Mao or the Chamber of Commerce interests as the main ah!
<br><br>Mao Lin was Yi Feng said full of embarrassment, hurriedly explained: "Look, that day I did not say the wrong thing, Master Yi which will be my mouth full of nonsense on the heart, I believe that ah, Master Yi is certainly not a petty person." First domain name m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"No, I just take Chairman Mao's words to heart." Yi Feng eyes, said bluntly, "And I, Yi Feng, am a stingy person."
<br><br>"You ......"
<br><br>Yi Feng's words, will Mao Lin angry enough, full of iron said: "What do you mean by this, really think our Chamber of Commerce must not you, I tell you, if you do not cooperate with our Chamber of Commerce, you think your book can sell what money?"
<br><br>"Then, since your Chamber of Commerce is not indispensable to me, that's even better." Yi Feng sneered, turned around and left, waving his hand, "Then you guys please go back!"
<br><br>"Don't don't don't."
<br><br>Yi Feng this sentence simply gambled Mao Lin heart and liver pain, he originally wanted to provoke Yi Feng, but did not expect to completely do not eat this set, face reloaded with a smile to pull Yi Feng.
<br><br>"How Mao President, also pulling on, you are still okay with this mouth?" Yi Feng asked indifferently with a partial head.
<br><br>Mao Lin face ugly let go of Yi Feng, hesitantly and then said, "So, you just make a price directly, how can you re-cooperate with my Pingjiang Chamber of Commerce."
<br><br>"Not interested."
<br><br>Yi Feng directly refused.
<br><br>"Two thousand gold coins?"
<br><br>Yi Feng did not say anything.
<br><br>"Three thousand gold coins?"
<br><br>Yi Feng still did not say anything.
<br><br>"Ten thousand gold coins?"
<br><br>Finally, Mao Lin clenched his teeth and shouted out a big number.
<br><br>"Chairman Mao, there is not so much regret medicine in the world." Yi Feng was too lazy to dwell on Mao Lin and said directly, "Besides, I, Yi Feng, am a petty person, I remember the humiliation you inflicted on me that day, so please go back!"
<br><br>"Yes, it's true that I shouldn't have that day, I can understand you remembering my revenge." Mao Lin didn't expect Yi Feng to be so oily, and said with a blue face, "But you don't want to have trouble with money, right? This is 10,000 gold coins, a whole 10,000 gold coins, which you can't earn for ten years, if this is not enough, your appetite is too big, right?"
<br><br>Speaking of this, his eyes narrowed and then said, "Aren't you afraid of holding yourself up?"
<br><br>Mao Lin's words made Yi Feng laugh.
<br><br>With his eyes raised, he asked rhetorically, "Is ten thousand gold coins a lot?"
<br><br>"Hairy boy, you have a big mouth!" Mao Lin said angrily with a sullen face, "Let alone 10,000 gold coins, even 500 gold coins you may not be able to take out."
<br><br>"Is that so?"
<br><br>Yi Feng raised the corner of his mouth.
