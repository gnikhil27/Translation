Hearing that.
<br><br>Yi Feng instantly drew a breath of cold air.
<br><br>This kind of character, it's really too awesome!
<br><br>So he hurriedly asked curiously, "Miss Li, dare I ask what kind of person this one is, that he is so terrifying as this?"
<br><br>"From their legends, they said that at least he was a Martial Emperor expert, because someone watched him take out a Half-Emperor lightly!" Li Yihan said it with a palpitating heart, and the same yearning for such a person.
<br><br>"Whew!"
<br><br>"If only I could be that bullish."
<br><br>Yi Feng sighed with emotion.
<br><br>It's a pity that the system doesn't compete!
<br><br>"You?"
<br><br>Li Yihan looked at Yi Feng, shook his head and said, "It's not that I mock you, you can't reach this even if you live ten lives over again, so you'd better be your mortal, this kind of character is not something you and I can speculate, and it's not even the same world as us!"

<br><br>On the side, Master Wang heard the words, his eyes could not help but move.
<br><br>Shook his head.
<br><br>I really don't know what this little girl will end up being scared into when she knows the truth.
<br><br>The good thing is that the gentleman is as broad-minded as the sky and does not take the foolishness of you juniors to heart.
<br><br>This section of the road to Nansha, and its difficult to walk.
<br><br>Bumpy all day, did not walk much, but also tired half dead.
<br><br>"By the way, which part of Nansha exactly are you going to?" At night, after setting up camp, Li Yihan asked towards Yi Feng.
<br><br>"Disciple, where is it?"
<br><br>Yi Feng asked.
<br><br>"Uh ...... under Jiang Yun's house."
<br><br>Zhong Qing scratched his head and said.
<br><br>"Ha Jiang?"
<br><br>Li Yihan frowned and shook his head, "You mortals are really not afraid of death, from Pingjiang City to Nansha is just, actually have to go to Nansha down the river."
<br><br>"What's the problem?" Yi Feng asked, puzzled.
<br><br>"Do you know, Nansha range is very large, a dutou river flows through it, so Nansha is divided into the upper river and lower river." Li Yihan explained, "That is to say, if you want to go to Ha Sha, you not only have to cross half of Nansha, but also need to cross the Du Tou River."
<br><br>"Oh, it's so far away." Yi Feng scratched his head.
<br><br>"I'm curious, what is it that makes a group of you mortals brave the danger and run so far?" Li Yihan asked suspiciously.
<br><br>At that, Zhong Qing, who was on the side, blushed and planted his head.
<br><br>Yi Feng also smiled quite embarrassingly and then told her about Zhong Qing's matter roughly.
<br><br>After listening, Li Yihan gave Yi Feng a very unexpected look and said leisurely, "Although I don't understand your actions, I have to say that you are very competent as a master."
<br><br>"I'm sorry to laugh."
<br><br>Yi Feng embarrassed a smile, subconsciously rubbed Zhong Qing's head.
<br><br>"By the way, there is still a doubt." Li Yihan asked again, "You Pingjiang City people, how did you get to know the people of Nan Sha Ha Jiang."
<br><br>"Right oh."
<br><br>Yi Feng knocked his head, looked questioningly at Zhong Qing, and asked: apprentice: "So far, you guys are, in the end, how did you get on?"
<br><br>Zhong Qing's small face was red, shy for a long time, before she said embarrassingly, "Meng Tian's grandma's home is in Pingjiang City, she followed her family back to Pingjiang City to visit relatives this time, before she and I met."
<br><br>"Oh."
<br><br>Yi Feng nodded his head with sudden realization.
<br><br>It turns out that the city girl went back to her grandmother's house on vacation, and this country wild boy in his family got it on.
<br><br>"Just, should have separated from you guys today, but this South Sand edge cultivators so many, you mortals a little touch of trouble I'm afraid you can not finish the journey." Li Yihan sighed with emotion and said, "It just so happens that you are still able to travel with me on this trip, so I will stay with you for a few more days, I hope you can successfully walk to the lower river!"
<br><br>"Thank you, Miss Li."
<br><br>Yi Feng smiled gratefully.
<br><br>Contact for a long time, found that this sister person is still quite good.
<br><br>Li Yihan was not talking, but paying attention to the movements of other cultivators around.
<br><br>She originally did not care to have too much contact with these mortals, but when she encountered the Night Cold Twin Furies, these mortals did not leave without her for fear of life and death.
<br><br>Perhaps there was no use for them to stay, but still, she could not help but feel moved in her heart, which is why she made this decision.
<br><br>"You guys have a good rest here, don't run around, I'll go see if there are any of my acquaintances." Li Yihan gave an explanation and walked towards the distance with her sword in her arms.
<br><br>But just a short distance away, someone blocked her way.
<br><br>By the moonlight, you can see that this person, dressed in black robes, is half leaning against a tree, left hand in his pocket, right hand holding a petunia flower, head down and lightly smell.
<br><br>A look of intoxication.
<br><br>Wind fluttering, black robe raised.
<br><br>In the moonlight, looking suave and elegant, jade tree.
<br><br>Suddenly, he tilted his head over and looked deeply at Li Yihan.
<br><br>"Oh~~~."
<br><br>A shake of the head, a sigh.
<br><br>"I once crossed mountains, rivers and seas, and also passed through mountains and seas of people, but ...... could not cross the girl's face posture and style!"
<br><br>Said, he lifted the petunia in his hand, dragging his feet, bouncing cha cha yo da da.
<br><br>Cheerfully circled around Li Yihan, the petunia flower in Li Yihan's nose gently crossed.
<br><br>Rationalized the black robe, said leisurely: "Guliang, tired good oh, under the skeleton Ben Wei, between this hot light so beautiful, there is no interest, and even a common appreciation of bright heat ah?"
