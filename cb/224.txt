"What to do Elder?"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er and long sword empty cowered in the corner, watching this man and a wolf approaching, Peng Xian'er immediately emitted a panicked voice.
<br><br>"It's okay, it's okay, calm down."
<br><br>"Must be calm, believe me, there is always a way!"
<br><br>Long sword empty pressure palm, towards Peng Xian'er softly comforted.
<br><br>"That's good, that's good."
<br><br>Seeing this, Peng Xian'er hurriedly nodded, and under the comfort of Long Jiankong, was considered to have taken a pill of certainty.
<br><br>After all, Long Jiankong was also an elder of the Heavenly Sword Sect, a strong person of Martial Exalted, no matter how you put it.
<br><br>However, the next moment.
<br><br>She then saw Chang Jiankong suddenly crunching on his knees and shouting out of his mouth.
<br><br>"Spare my life!" Remember the website http://m.biquxs. com
<br><br>"Big Brother spare your life!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er was dumbfounded.
<br><br>The entire person became dumbfounded.
<br><br>This was what Long Jiankong, the way he said?
<br><br>"Still frozen what, still not quickly with me kneel down and beg for mercy, so strong people do not have to resist ah, stay in the green hills do not worry about burning wood, and here and no one, and will not lose our face ah!" Long Jiankong winked at Peng Xian'er one after another and said in a shaky voice.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er's face was full of reluctance.
<br><br>In the past, she had suffered a lot in order to cultivate, but that was fine.
<br><br>Now that she had the chance to become a human being, she had to kneel down for someone.
<br><br>But remembering the terror of that black robe, the last pride in her heart was struck to the ground.
<br><br>Flutter!
<br><br>She also knelt down and began to beg for mercy.
<br><br>"Jie Jie ......"
<br><br>An eerie smile came from the mouth of a bone and a dog, looking at the two from a high position.
<br><br>"You two, give me all the money you have!" The black-robed man bellowed fiercely.
<br><br>"Yes, take it all out, or you two will die!" The dog also raised his proud head and sent out a threatening voice.
<br><br>A bone and a dog words, scared Peng Xian'er two people breathing rapidly, do not dare to delay.
<br><br>Trembling palms just pulling out something inside the storage ring.
<br><br>"My lord, the royal product, the royal product pills." Long Jiankong panderingly pulled out a jade bottle and handed it over with both hands.
<br><br>"What kind of junk stuff?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei took a glance at it, angrily threw it on the ground and crushed it with one foot, cursing fiercely while kicking both feet on Long Jiankong's body.
<br><br>"Spare my life, don't hit me." Long Jiankong shouted trembling, at the same time pulled out a bottle of Zong Pin pill from inside the storage ring.
<br><br>"Zong Pin, this time it's from Zong Pin, the two lords laugh at it."
<br><br>Long Jiankong said flatteringly.
<br><br>"Yes, yes, I have another bottle here." Peng Xian'er also hurriedly took out a bottle from her storage ring and handed it over with a forced smile.
<br><br>"Grass, playing us two brothers?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei crushed the two jade bottles with one hand and slapped both of them on the face.
<br><br>"Don't rush don't rush, we still have ......"
<br><br>Seeing that these two are still not satisfied, Long Jiankong said again in a hurry, and then gritting his teeth full of reluctance, he brought out a round basin.
<br><br>"Senior, Zun Pin, Zun Pin divine artifact trapped heaven basin, absolute good thing."
<br><br>Long Jiankong hurriedly offered the Heaven Trapping Basin with both hands.
<br><br>However, Bone Ben Wei took one look at the basin and exploded.
<br><br>"You old thing, bringing your old lady's broken basin for washing her ass to dismiss me, I think you guys are looking for death."
<br><br>"Yes you, I think you guys are looking for death." The dog also pandered fiercely from the side.
<br><br>With that, Bone Ben Wei raised his sandbag-sized fist and was about to smash it over.
<br><br>"No, no, no, I have more here."
<br><br>The blossoming Peng Xian'er waved her hands and hurriedly shouted.
<br><br>Only when she saw this did Bone Ben Wei turn his gaze to her.
<br><br>Peng Xian'er showed a reluctant look and took out a Green Rainbow Sword from inside her storage ring.
<br><br>"This is exclusive to my Heavenly Sword Sect's Holy Maiden, the Green Rainbow Sword, an existence that is infinitely close to a holy item, please look at it senior!"
<br><br>Peng Xian'er bit her red lips tightly and said with a fleshy face.
<br><br>"Oh?"
<br><br>"Fancy and pretty?"
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei took it and looked it up and down.
<br><br>"I just don't know how the quality is."
<br><br>Saying that, he stretched out his finger and fell towards the sword.
<br><br>A flick.
<br><br>Just at the moment his fingertip fell, a pleasant trilling sound came.
<br><br>Clang!
<br><br>One section of the Green Rainbow Sword was directly flicked out of sight by Bone Ben Wei, and the other section turned dull.
<br><br>Gah!
<br><br>Peng Xian'er and Long Jiankong immediately looked dumbfounded, and their eyes almost burst out directly.
<br><br>A Green Rainbow Sword that was close to a Saint's item was destroyed by the bullet just like that?
<br><br>"Another trash thing that is useless in appearance."
<br><br>Bone Ben Wei angrily threw the Green Rainbow Sword onto the ground, stomped it into pieces and drank, "Qing, I think these two pussies are just playing with us, get rid of them."
<br><br>With that, Bones Ben Wei kicked towards the two men menacingly, and the dog also raised his huge sharp claws on the side, scratching them claw by claw.
<br><br>"Oooh ......"
<br><br>"No more, we really don't have any more babies."
<br><br>"Yes, spare our lives, our most valuable Green Rainbow Sword is all given to you, please bypass us."
<br><br>Two people cowered in the corner, under the violent beating of a bone and a dog, has long since become inhuman, especially Ao Qing's giant claws, specializing in picking tricky places, two people in rags, making Peng Xian'er's white thighs have become bloody.
<br><br>"Hmph, bring it."
<br><br>Skeleton Ben Wei snatched the two people's storage rings, and the dog one to see one.
<br><br>"Brother, these two are really poor bastards, there is not a single dollar in it."
<br><br>After looking at the storage ring, the dog clawed it and smashed it and said.
<br><br>"Bad luck, really bad luck, I don't have anything here either." Bone Ben Wei also crushed the storage ring into pieces and cursed viciously with hatred.
<br><br>"Then what should I do?" The dog said in a low mood.
<br><br>"Forget it, two poor bastards with them to delay the time is meaningless, ignore them."
<br><br>Said, a bone and a dog will be two people again a violent beating, and only then swaggered away.
<br><br>Back to the steps.
<br><br>One Bone One Dog continued to be in a low mood again.
<br><br>"Alas, when will I, Skeleton Ben Wei, live a life of luxury!" The skeleton raised the sky with a sigh, while playing with the centipede in his hand, plucking its legs one by one.
<br><br>"Can ......"
<br><br>"Can't ......"
<br><br>"Can ......"
<br><br>"Can't ......"
<br><br>"......"
<br><br>At this moment the night wind centipede heart that pain ah.
<br><br>It is simply a robbery and another robbery, just out of the tiger's den, and like the wolf pit.
<br><br>I wanted to play dead in the hands of this skeleton to mix it up, but looking at their own less and less legs, it is finally sulking, originally looked dead look, fierce in the hands of skeleton Ben Wei struggled.
<br><br>"Spare my life, spare my life ......"
<br><br>He shouted in his mouth.
